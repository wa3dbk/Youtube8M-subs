00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
these and it came in as a PNG which

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.469 
these and it came in as a PNG which
doesn't<00:02:01.380> work<00:02:02.100> too<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.880> After<00:02:03.180> Effects

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
doesn't work too well with After Effects

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.869 
doesn't work too well with After Effects
so<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.719> went<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> Photoshop<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:07.729> saved<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
so I went at the Photoshop and saved it

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.260 
so I went at the Photoshop and saved it
as<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> TIFF<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.830> saved<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> transparency<00:02:11.730> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
as a TIFF and saved the transparency so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.410 
as a TIFF and saved the transparency so
that<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.510> could

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that I could

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.530 
that I could
do<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.110> add<00:02:14.590> transparency<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> map<00:02:16.240> so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
do it add transparency on to the map so

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.400 
do it add transparency on to the map so
I'll<00:02:16.810> show<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.050> real<00:02:17.230> quick<00:02:19.170> import<00:02:20.170> file

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
I'll show you a real quick import file

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.510 
I'll show you a real quick import file
and<00:02:20.740> then<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.209> PNG<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.400> when<00:02:24.400> you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
and then this is the PNG and when you

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.220 
and then this is the PNG and when you
see<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.330> bring<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:26.709> got<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.720> trans<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
see I bring it in it's got the trans the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.130 
see I bring it in it's got the trans the
output<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.850> white<00:02:31.060> alpha<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.630> still<00:02:31.930> on

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
output is the white alpha is still on

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.830 
output is the white alpha is still on
the<00:02:32.260> back<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.800> that's<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.490> my<00:02:33.640> want<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.780> I

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the back and that's not my want so I

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.910 
the back and that's not my want so I
just<00:02:35.020> saved<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.380> as<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> tiff<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:37.230> that's<00:02:38.230> how

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
just saved it as a tiff and that's how

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.520 
just saved it as a tiff and that's how
it<00:02:39.040> works<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.840> an<00:02:40.989> easy<00:02:41.230> way<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
it works it's a it's an easy way you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.680 
it works it's a it's an easy way you
don't<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.920> mess<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.540> effects<00:02:43.540> or

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
don't have to mess with effects or

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.190 
don't have to mess with effects or
anything<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.380> still<00:02:45.130> like<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.280> under<00:02:45.700> there

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
anything so still like that under there

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.840 
anything so still like that under there
so<00:02:47.200> basic<00:02:47.739> animation<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.500> use<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.580> arrow

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
so basic animation you use the arrow

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.800 
so basic animation you use the arrow
arrow<00:02:52.420> key<00:02:53.260> here<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.800> move<00:02:54.340> your<00:02:54.519> guy<00:02:54.670> around

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.210 

see<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.080> you<00:03:00.010> twirl<00:03:00.340> down<00:03:00.580> here<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:03.040> can

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
see and you twirl down here and you can

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.270 
see and you twirl down here and you can
see<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.640> transform<00:03:04.590> menu<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.040> twirl<00:03:06.250> it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
see the transform menu if you twirl it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.310 
see the transform menu if you twirl it
down<00:03:06.519> again<00:03:06.790> then<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.630> these<00:03:07.900> different

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
down again then you get these different

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.979 
down again then you get these different
settings<00:03:09.100> here<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.030> anchor<00:03:10.180> point<00:03:10.510> position

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
settings here the anchor point position

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.860 
settings here the anchor point position
scale<00:03:11.380> rotation<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.370> opacity<00:03:12.610> well<00:03:13.570> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
scale rotation and opacity well the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.759 
scale rotation and opacity well the
position<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.620> what<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.550> use<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:16.019> moving<00:03:17.019> left

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
position is what you use for moving left

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.520 
position is what you use for moving left
to<00:03:17.860> right<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.220> up<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.430> down<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:18.910> 2d<00:03:19.269> space<00:03:19.530> so

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
to right and up to down in 2d space so

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.470 
to right and up to down in 2d space so
that<00:03:20.860> would<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.070> on<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> X<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.700> y<00:03:21.850> axis<00:03:21.880> to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that would be on the X and y axis to

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.250 
that would be on the X and y axis to
start<00:03:26.370> animating<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.700> always<00:03:28.090> want<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.450> click

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
start animating you always want to click

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.670 
start animating you always want to click
on<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.220> stopwatch<00:03:30.549> here<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
on this little stopwatch here and that

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.990 
on this little stopwatch here and that
sets<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.010> keyframe<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.709> that'll<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:36.000> every

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
sets a keyframe and that'll be every

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.970 
sets a keyframe and that'll be every
time<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.989> stopwatch<00:03:38.290> enabled

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
time you have that stopwatch enabled

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.699 
time you have that stopwatch enabled
right<00:03:39.100> there<00:03:39.340> it'll<00:03:40.000> always<00:03:40.959> set<00:03:41.500> keyframes

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
right there it'll always set keyframes

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.050 
right there it'll always set keyframes
every<00:03:42.160> time<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.489> move<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.329> let's<00:03:43.630> move<00:03:43.959> ahead

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
every time you move so let's move ahead

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.270 
every time you move so let's move ahead
two<00:03:46.060> seconds<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.890> if<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:48.100> move<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.519> guy<00:03:48.730> over

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
two seconds and if we move this guy over

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.920 
two seconds and if we move this guy over
if<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.400> hold<00:03:51.610> shift<00:03:51.700> he'll<00:03:52.600> move<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.870> a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
if you hold shift he'll move in a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.920 
if you hold shift he'll move in a
straight<00:03:52.989> line<00:03:53.310> while<00:03:54.310> you're<00:03:54.459> dragging<00:03:54.930> if

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
straight line while you're dragging if

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.069 
straight line while you're dragging if
you<00:03:56.769> let<00:03:56.980> go<00:03:57.010> shipped<00:03:57.400> he'll<00:03:57.820> just<00:03:58.120> he'll<00:03:58.930> move

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
you let go shipped he'll just he'll move

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.420 
you let go shipped he'll just he'll move
or<00:03:59.260> move<00:03:59.880> anywhere<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.000> want<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:02.430> straight

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
or move anywhere you want so straight

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.199 
or move anywhere you want so straight
line<00:04:03.610> across<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.620> can<00:04:05.829> see<00:04:06.010> he<00:04:06.220> moves

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.440 

so<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.200> go<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.590> middle<00:04:10.769> here<00:04:11.450> maybe

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
so if you go in the middle here maybe

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.300 
so if you go in the middle here maybe
you<00:04:12.689> want<00:04:12.930> them<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.230> move<00:04:13.799> up<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.430> little<00:04:14.969> so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
you want them to move up a little so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.340 
you want them to move up a little so
there<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.459> go<00:04:17.810> then<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.900> got<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.079> nice<00:04:19.289> little

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
there we go then you got a nice little

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.939 
there we go then you got a nice little
nice<00:04:22.350> little<00:04:22.430> motion<00:04:23.430> path<00:04:23.610> there<00:04:26.960> now<00:04:27.960> it's

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
nice little motion path there now it's

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.279 
nice little motion path there now it's
not<00:04:29.160> always<00:04:29.430> time<00:04:29.970> efficient<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.780> always<00:04:31.080> be

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
not always time efficient to always be

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.960 
not always time efficient to always be
twirling<00:04:32.220> down<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:34.590> going<00:04:35.370> here<00:04:35.520> because<00:04:35.639> the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
twirling down and going here because the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.580 
twirling down and going here because the
little<00:04:36.240> triangle<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:36.870> small<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:37.259> got<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> get

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
little triangle so small you got to get

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.710 
little triangle so small you got to get
right<00:04:37.740> on<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.789> quickest<00:04:39.090> way<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.300> get

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
right on it so the quickest way to get

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.350 
right on it so the quickest way to get
to<00:04:40.440> your<00:04:40.560> animation<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.520> animated<00:04:41.940> position

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
to your animation to animated position

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.900 
to your animation to animated position
is<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.930> hotkey<00:04:43.349> P<00:04:43.620> while<00:04:44.370> you<00:04:44.610> have<00:04:44.880> your

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
is the hotkey P while you have your

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.040 
is the hotkey P while you have your
layer<00:04:45.419> selected<00:04:45.900> so<00:04:46.380> press<00:04:47.340> P<00:04:47.840> position<00:04:48.840> comes

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050
