this year the go cry was exactly the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.860 
this year the go cry was exactly the
right<00:02:33.470> track<00:02:33.830> what<00:02:34.370> energy<00:02:34.910> is<00:02:35.060> aiming<00:02:35.450> for<00:02:35.480> is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
right track what energy is aiming for is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.540 
right track what energy is aiming for is
like<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.410> big<00:02:36.680> room<00:02:36.890> it's<00:02:37.160> still<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> bit

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
like really big room it's still a bit

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.200 
like really big room it's still a bit
transient<00:02:38.300> fluids<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.280> yeah<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.610> think<00:02:41.000> it's

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
transient fluids and yeah I think it's

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.620 
transient fluids and yeah I think it's
between<00:02:41.660> electro<00:02:42.440> progressive<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.460> house<00:02:44.120> so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
between electro progressive and house so

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.690 
between electro progressive and house so
I<00:02:44.840> think<00:02:45.380> that's<00:02:46.040> what<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.340> gonna<00:02:46.460> do<00:02:46.580> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I think that's what we're gonna do it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.950 
I think that's what we're gonna do it
like<00:02:46.820> execute<00:02:47.390> play<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.190> connect<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:49.960> those

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
like execute play and connect so those

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.040 
like execute play and connect so those
three<00:02:51.230> elements<00:02:51.350> are<00:02:52.570> exactly<00:02:53.570> in<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> track
