this<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> perfect<00:00:05.940> example<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.330> what

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
this is a perfect example of what

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.540 
this is a perfect example of what
happens<00:00:06.839> when<00:00:07.170> slowing<00:00:07.500> helps<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:08.189> team<00:00:08.429> is

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
happens when slowing helps my team is

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.490 
happens when slowing helps my team is
down<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.730> couple<00:00:09.090> points<00:00:09.420> there's<00:00:10.170> only<00:00:10.320> two

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
down a couple points there's only two

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.839 
down a couple points there's only two
and<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> half<00:00:10.800> minutes<00:00:11.099> left<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> game

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and a half minutes left in the game

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.580 
and a half minutes left in the game
I<00:00:11.880> kept<00:00:12.360> brushed<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.780> B<00:00:12.900> flag<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.380> believe

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
I kept brushed for the B flag I believe

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.230 
I kept brushed for the B flag I believe
that<00:00:13.740> capped<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.070> once<00:00:14.309> or<00:00:14.610> twice<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that capped at once or twice but it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.129 
that capped at once or twice but it
doesn't<00:00:15.480> matter<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.929> still

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
doesn't matter because we're still

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.750 
doesn't matter because we're still
losing<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.590> instead<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:16.980> doing<00:00:17.160> plane<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
losing so instead of doing plane a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.429 
losing so instead of doing plane a
because<00:00:18.420> obviously<00:00:18.630> that's<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.230> working

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
because obviously that's not working

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.840 
because obviously that's not working
let's<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:19.980> Plan<00:00:20.189> B<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.550> does<00:00:20.640> plane

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
let's go with Plan B what does plane

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
let's go with Plan B what does plane

I've<00:00:23.070> been<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> class<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> whole

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I've been using this class the whole

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
I've been using this class the whole
entire<00:00:24.420> game<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.830> at

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
entire game but this is what you do at

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.759 
entire game but this is what you do at
the<00:00:26.369> MSMC<00:00:26.880> extended<00:00:27.630> mags<00:00:27.930> quick<00:00:28.470> draw<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the MSMC extended mags quick draw and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.380 
the MSMC extended mags quick draw and
sit<00:00:29.160> out<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> smoke<00:00:29.609> grenade<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.000> saw<00:00:30.179> my

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sit out the smoke grenade you saw my

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.299 
sit out the smoke grenade you saw my
perks<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.810> well<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.470> smoke<00:00:31.740> grenades<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
probably one of the most important

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.450 
probably one of the most important
things<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.680> setup<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.340> can

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
things in this setup because you can

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.709 
things in this setup because you can

felt<00:02:46.590> about<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.920> video<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.760> thing

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
felt about the video and one more thing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.000 
felt about the video and one more thing
so<00:02:48.840> there's<00:02:49.049> some<00:02:49.200> videos<00:02:49.500> flying<00:02:49.799> around

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
so there's some videos flying around

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
so there's some videos flying around
stating<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.549> our<00:02:50.609> reverse<00:02:51.000> boosted<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.780> if

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
stating that our reverse boosted now if

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.300 
stating that our reverse boosted now if
you<00:02:52.019> don't<00:02:52.139> know<00:02:52.349> where<00:02:52.500> reverse<00:02:52.769> boosting<00:02:53.159> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you don't know where reverse boosting is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.009 
you don't know where reverse boosting is
it's<00:02:53.579> pretty<00:02:53.730> much<00:02:53.849> when<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.569> reset<00:02:54.870> your

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
it's pretty much when you reset your

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.960 
it's pretty much when you reset your
stats<00:02:55.230> meaning<00:02:55.650> whatever<00:02:55.829> rank<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.310> are<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
stats meaning whatever rank you are you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490 
stats meaning whatever rank you are you
were<00:02:57.090> set<00:02:57.359> all<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.599> way<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.720> level<00:02:58.019> one<00:02:58.319> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
were set all the way to level one and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.129 
were set all the way to level one and
then<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:59.010> play<00:02:59.190> terrible<00:02:59.819> every<00:03:00.450> single<00:03:00.720> game

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
then you play terrible every single game

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.990 
then you play terrible every single game
well<00:03:01.560> majority<00:03:02.010> game<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.430> your<00:03:02.549> stats<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.970> be

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
well majority game so your stats can be

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.339 
well majority game so your stats can be
really<00:03:03.299> low<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.690> then<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.810> play<00:03:04.079> against

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
really low and then you play against

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.809 
really low and then you play against
other<00:03:04.590> people<00:03:04.889> who<00:03:04.980> have<00:03:05.099> similar<00:03:05.129> stats<00:03:05.639> so

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
other people who have similar stats so

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.520 
other people who have similar stats so
you<00:03:05.879> can<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.180> great<00:03:06.540> gameplays<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.349> post

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you can get great gameplays and you post

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.830 
you can get great gameplays and you post
it<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.400> Internet<00:03:08.760> now<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.209> never<00:03:09.329> did<00:03:09.659> that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it on the Internet now I never did that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.899 
it on the Internet now I never did that
if<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.230> want<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.409> see<00:03:10.560> why<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.739> reset<00:03:11.549> my<00:03:11.579> stats

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
if you want to see why I reset my stats

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
know like having like although win-loss

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
know like having like although win-loss
it<00:03:20.519> doesn't<00:03:20.819> really<00:03:20.940> mean<00:03:21.180> anything<00:03:21.239> cuz<00:03:21.629> she

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
it doesn't really mean anything cuz she

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.599 
it doesn't really mean anything cuz she
places<00:03:21.989> all<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.260> majority<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.709> time<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.370> check

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
want to make multiple counts so you can

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.439
