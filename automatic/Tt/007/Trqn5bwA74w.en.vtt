00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
 in the world of music and cinema we go back in time here we are 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.360
 at the time of silent cinema 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.070
 whereas the cinema accompanied the images is what could live in 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.329
 live the audience of the hall of the ponant 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:17.689
 % a parenthesis to the chronicle time she part of the international festival 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.480
 while I'm appealing 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.480
 actually this experience the report 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.600
 what 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.250
 this Sunday, July 31 for the first time probably the director of 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.090
 cultural affairs of the principality had decided on tf1 their take for 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.990
 install it in a movie theater in the hall of the ponant 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.180
 the extent to which this lack is unknown 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.400
 but it's our task is there because today justin mans we want 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.980
 to show our audience our loyal audience 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.250
 facets of this ranking and it's true that it's something that has a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.850
 little forgotten today but while much served 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 outside the churches and in particular the cinema during the announcement of the cinema 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.600
 the protopic who he discussed to accompany 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 the film presents 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.440
 this movie marry nostrum shot in the bathrooms pink victorine 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.020
 in nice 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.939
 by graham team after a novel of place that give him reason this silent film 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.939
 was accompanied live by the organist and composer 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.540
 improvising on a movie buff 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 the organ amum str4 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.860
 four keyboards unique in France made in the United States this organ 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.180
 which has 300 register the day all the music create atmospheres of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.570
 besson prize necessary for the musical accompaniment a film 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.410
 as it is an instrument that like m 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.110
 the ones of a completely new conception 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.230
 and I told him if a whole visit 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.660
 but these chipsets sampled 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.090
 produce orchestral sounds produce sound a lot of wood 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.700
 arcades in addition it is said that as of December who are in the street by a 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 instrument 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.650
 we have a name a whole pallet computing said a palette of sounds 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.890
 as a painter actually there are several colors either he wants ten of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 colors 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 torso koivu colors immediately 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.270
 wood water all his descent and for those of the rest he is called unity 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.659
 orchestra 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.309
 on his pedals for example we have a siren 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 a firefighter siren 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.639
 here we have for example 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.639
 so I can do for example if a manual sound effect 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.839
 thanks to these works 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 in the movie for example as there is a Spanish atmosphere 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.479
 I use for example been signed 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.719
 jean vernet henry canton canton is there for this big 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.969
 we can really do sensational things 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.369
 actually if so I really believe a first 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.569
 in Monaco to be able to hear this instrument live with the film
