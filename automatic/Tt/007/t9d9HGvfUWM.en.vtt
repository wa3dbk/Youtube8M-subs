00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.400
 hello and welcome back last st 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.470
 I now say this sentence for the fourth 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.980
 not because I'm finally recording 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.480
 sold 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:29.289
 I won 43 times now I hope 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.570
 that will finally be there luz are real 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.460
 not here next I will not have any soon 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.870
 time more and if that is now the fourth 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.019
 is vividly united but I found 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 somehow not the one I fought 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.250
 then everyone was very good 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.890
 So yes, I was really cool, I said 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.710
 weight or not good then I'm fine 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.839
 of 3,000 of live recording in which 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.629
 I think it would be up to 1700 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.489
 2000 intersected with me because that part 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.340
 yes pretty good skin on the skin 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 human and I was have so far had 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 also luck in these few battles 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.590
 nothing in a very high animal yet 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 come 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:24.500
 speak knew this was 8 that can 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:29.909
 Of course, a reason for that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 I do that well , but I like it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.399
 me in any case of the playful 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 because he's just not quite as long 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.710
 lion holds again though about as much 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.840
 Like the lion and I would almost 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.979
 say better than the lion so 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 actually a complete package what stop 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:55.170
 good lion far better lion 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.310
 just in russian form and that is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.270
 the tower of mika if it is not 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.270
 is popped 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.149
 and yes again on their news now 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.149
 Time is running out 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.350
 boy fuck you i hate these people 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
 hawke anne people put 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.650
 and with that you have to say it really new 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.360
 I like to do 400 damage 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.319
 because the fire rate is perfectly okay 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.010
 it's still fast lion again 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.569
 if I often come, yes, only 10 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.079
 seconds or so is it I think 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.030
 always faster in the near country actually 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.420
 both of course more punch 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.409
 only in eighth in the area is the u6 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.090
 Enough detail until now 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:09.030
 range joke sometimes a bit tight 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.200
 but otherwise perfectly adequate 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.519
 I like mobility in any case 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.689
 armor is somehow really 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.970
 not so bad the example of the type 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.020
 the holding one more 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:34.400
 why am I always paying behind me 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:36.350
 I can say yes, yes 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.690
 Maybe there is now then I am 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.700
 Of course losing is very good now 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.980
 I want to reach an average 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.740
 say so 1,800 to 2,000 m 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.680
 you can do that with the part already 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.680
 relatively easy average 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:00.690
 ammunition on him anyway through 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.770
 so aiming has seen me on this 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 how many meters is it 406 1 6 cm 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.430
 the precise as she and I have now 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.940
 Of course that was also here with spot 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.940
 but as stuff is like that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.050
 is still good dvd 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.110
 and it seems to me that I am the reason 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.710
 that we win this sounds now 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.710
 not a little 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.689
 even in love but somehow knows 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.589
 I mean 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.009
 for more than 3,000 beds and batteries 

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:48.739
 who can not see asbos over one 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:50.979
 Sinn did not fight but if I did 

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:50.979
 die now 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.310
 we could almost have called that if 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.310
 kiel is almost to dubai 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:19.110
 please do not call me down now but me 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:22.720
 will not be the chains right now 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.789
 I do not want to win me 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.830
 Now really stupid and I do that 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:36.340
 otherwise, it's never just me, I'm slow 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:40.259
 no time left and that's just me 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:47.139
 long I counted 45 battles 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:49.120
 and everytime I go in there 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.389
 always need such a battle 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.360
 that the similarities and ultimately 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.690
 is it always enough then I want 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.490
 also in the roman de luz 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.819
 I want to win these ones 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.099
 rather on my account just have there 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.520
 the victory is in it as soon as I brake 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:11.940
 has been victorious two times is called sc malus es 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:21.389
 is such a point me but sometimes buys 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:21.389
 and not for long 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.920
 not as good as the others are not 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.060
 drive to 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:34.150
 just because I still can make me 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.290
 Oh my god , I'm loose 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.560
 have lost 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.560
 a miracle a miracle 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.250
 516 last I managed had now 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.910
 at the beginning I say average 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.230
 battles 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.280
 but clearly that's 4000 damage now 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.840
 may not be an average though 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.830
 I mean half of that 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.440
 maybe take 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.510
 that to me is almost average 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.410
 I can fight the last one 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.360
 demonstrate 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.510
 I've fought in just about anyone 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.510
 3000 of the participated 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.510
 3100 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:27.220
 3500 3000 so it is already right 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.620
 no idea now I'm fine 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.410
 honestly thought now 3000 of 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.150
 a cut above 2000 was one 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.040
 4000 round then of course one more 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.910
 a bit more 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.480
 Well, what the hell, I finally have it now 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.100
 the los 100,000 grills I meant 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.380
 I'm over 3000 then doing power 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:50.050
 times hospice 78,000 plus that 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.150
 Of course, there is a lot he is doing here 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:56.680
 munitions costs can yes even 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:08:00.600
 watch what it costs 1000 is natural 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.600
 quite a bit and 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.080
 furthermore, millennium xp can be used with 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.230
 I would say that I live 

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.530
 and I like that because in any case 

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.670
 I like the tank running Yes I am 

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:17.910
 actually you should already 

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.910
 finally i have the news and tulle
