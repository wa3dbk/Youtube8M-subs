00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.710
 tuenti five 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.579
 kids teach a very simple trick 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.810
 for the pc warning I do not know if 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.640
 it also works in movie 4 because 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.100
 only all the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 games in war frame you know how to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
 it climbs up the walls so it does not 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 I need to tell you how it is done for 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 once you watch since the character is 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.839
 about to get tired you give the ub and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.360
 you keep holding the jog button and 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.530
 the jump and continue climbing is worth every 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.510
 Once you see that you are about to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.399
 get married you give it to the vee and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.050
 will continue climbing you have to have 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.059
 be careful because as you can see in the video 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.890
 I have some celsa at the beginning according to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.500
 the area by which your vice may 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.640
 slip and end up falling, you see 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 that at the beginning I have some happy if 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.019
 the character just falls down too 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.550
 see that changing end 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.289
 character and changing the map so that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.119
 check what works in all 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.679
 maps that trick works from the alpha 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.940
 of pc and to this day still have not 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:14.679
 updated so I doubt that what 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.270
 update you have to take into account 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.649
 that a lot of the maps have a 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.330
 limit not to say all the maps 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.710
 they have a limit of aparto overcome 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.060
 said limit either above or by 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.069
 down the sides is for you 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.659
 security is from the map I put you back 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.009
 the last safe area that you have stepped on 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.500
 so you have to be very careful 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.480
 with that because if you go up too high 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.800
 appear at the last point that you have 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.630
 touched enemies and can kill them and 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.479
 good nothing kids that's all it 's like that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.010
 of easy to click the click you will have 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.570
 my channel to descriptions a channel of 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.040
 Nintendo gameplay but good too 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.300
 a secondary channel that will shortly 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.430

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.290
 pepe gameplay included direct and 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
