00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello everyone today we are going to make a cake 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 of cottage cheese or of grullo the cake consists 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.890
 of two parts we will describe the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 ingredients for what would be the basis 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 we will need 100 grams of butter 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 or margarine 80 grams of sugar a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.560
 vanilla sugar sachet gives because 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 prefer then vanilla essence 200 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.730
 grams of flour a pinch of salt a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.070
 egg and a spoonful of what would be 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.559
 Royal baking powder is not yeast 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.470
 be baking powder and butter 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.220
 you can find the rolled in addition a 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.100
 mold that can be dismantled 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.489
 later that would be the basis 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 for the filling the kilo of chicken 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.040
 cottage cheese 250 grams of butter 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 margarine and 300 grams of sugar another 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.780
 pinch of salt another pack of sugar 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 vanilla 230 grams of raisins 40 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.009
 grams of cornstarch 2 teaspoons of juice 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.170
 of lemon and the yolks of 6 eggs and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.409
 six clear the booking to the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.569
 end of the process increase we will see them 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.920
 what we do with them this would be in 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.780
 principle all good 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.390
 We'll start by putting the butter 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.789
 first we have put a few seconds 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.490
 to the microwave in order that it's done 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.490
 softly we put the sugar 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.010
 the poor sugar vanilla goes or 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.950
 If you have decided the essence, it is the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.580
 moment 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.580
 of salt 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.400
 and the egg we will mix 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.640
 everything very well and we see that we continue 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.640
 doing 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 we already have everything well integrated 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.210
 then now let's add the flour 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.740
 together with the dust we are already removing 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.880
 until everything again 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.930
 I was well mixed 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.850
 when few that already well integrated will be 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.440
 the time to put it in the mold 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.240
 we already have the mass for the base then 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.570
 with a cat tongue what are we going to 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.760
 do is lining the whole mold both the 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.940
 floor as the sides expand 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 well it 's all a report that you can and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.020
 I repeat the base and the walls well 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.640
 we have our mold lined I have to 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 say that with the tongue of the cat arrives 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.320
 a moment that is no longer effective so 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.560
 that a good option is to flour a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.270
 little fingers and stretch it until 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.030
 is more or less uniform throughout the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.510
 Monte , we have it now, let's see the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.510
 filling 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.410
 we will start mixing the butter that 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.130
 we have melted a little bit like 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.880
 microwave before it is platita 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.880
 together with sugar 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.430
 a pinch of salt and sugar 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.780
 vanilla and that we integrate very well 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.060
 until the sugar is diluted and the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.920
 butter that we have put about 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.680
 seconds to the microwave so that 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.080
 put a blandita we will add the yolks 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.590
 egg whites as we said the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.250
 we have booked for the end and also 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.849
 we will put a sachet of sugar to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.849
 vanilla 2 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.590
 in sugar 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.110
 and the little balance 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.459
 with this we will work well well well 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.859
 until fully Diluted 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.859
 sugar and then we have 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.380
 well we already have everything well integrated 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.729
 then as we said the rest of 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.290
 cottage cheese ingredients for inside 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.660
 a little 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.360
 then 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.990
 without further delay to the rest of him 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.990
 the cloth 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.600
 the lemon 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.370
 all except as we said before 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.550
 the clear ones that we will reserve for the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.980
 end so well to remove all 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.569
 that we have inside when you pass it 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.869
 already the mind 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.029
 we have already mixed the ingredients well 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:52.189
 then what we have left is to add 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:55.610
 the clear ones that we have mounted them to point 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:58.580
 of snow and simply with movements 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.509
 envelopes so that they do not lower us 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.760
 let's go calmly mixing 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.580
 shape 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.460
 all the mix once well fine 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.130
 integrated what we will do about the mold 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.009
 and we will take it to a preheated oven 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.669
 to 175 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.960
 to degrees we will put it one hour and then 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.229
 we will see to see the results 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.430
 and we already have everything in the mold what 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:31.099
 said at 175 degrees see you in an hour 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.080
 to see how it looks good this is the example 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.090
 of presentation we have simply 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.120
 put a little bit of whipped cream 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.550
