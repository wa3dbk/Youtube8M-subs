00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.099
 Hello, we continue to pass 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.380
 goblins and the next level will be us 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.529
 such a small intrigue because of 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.739
 San Diego has not yet passed and thus to 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.590
 you know what we need barbarians here 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.149
 lot 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.270
 can take 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.949
 also archers especially you will need 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.160
 wall battles and if birds are allowed clan 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:47.410
 the fortress can take and giants means 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:52.710
 first we need to destroy the walls so 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:01:00.280
 here then release and here a few 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:07.420
 these so then do so here but we 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:10.869
 flair let's release here so not so 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 Here they have broken here, although here we are 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:19.200
 don't really need her so mean 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.430
 let out a couple more here and here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.810
 excellent everywhere broken mean let's 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.439
 let's break it here first 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.439
 so first one after another 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 it means that you can already release on these 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.439
 here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 mortars though it is better to let out 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:52.020
 first break one after another to 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.500
 so that the least warriors how to spend 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:04.250
 here and according to the tradition that she got on 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:08.210
 well, so they ran to the guns so well, well 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 Well fine, we have passed this level may 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.660
 practically 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.010
 so it is good when we will already 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.050
 bent when i pass 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.680
 view in the level that did not pass as 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.560
 from the same future and earn on 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.150
 Generally you need only stenoboy and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.150
 more barbarian take good luck
