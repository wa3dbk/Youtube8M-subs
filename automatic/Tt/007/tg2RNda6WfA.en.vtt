00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.640
 at the moment it has been valued in the scene 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.439

 hairdresser who had already started work 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.550
 without an authority is the magnitude of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.100
 matter could have been much more serious 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.440
 because the day is articulated carrying 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.480

 parking for more than an hour 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.280
 private vehicles like those of 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310

 then traffic was restored in the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.350
 to move the biarticulate impacted and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.280
