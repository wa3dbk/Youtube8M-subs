00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
finally the new one the CTE what is this

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.870 
finally the new one the CTE what is this
thing<00:00:08.670> called<00:00:08.940> elite<00:00:10.219> episodes<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> CT<00:00:11.580> warp

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
thing called elite episodes the CT warp

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.150 
thing called elite episodes the CT warp
elite<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> part<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> work<00:00:13.110> family<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> CTE

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
elite is part of the work family and CTE

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.019 
elite is part of the work family and CTE
so<00:00:15.000> there's<00:00:15.299> warp<00:00:15.540> sings<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.740> four<00:00:17.730> G's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
so there's warp sings there's four G's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.029 
so there's warp sings there's four G's
and<00:00:18.359> everything<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.900> there's<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.500> new<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.830> it

and everything but there's a new one it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.830 
and everything but there's a new one it
actually<00:00:20.460> looks<00:00:20.609> pretty<00:00:20.880> freaking<00:00:21.480> cool<00:00:21.510> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the downside is it by freaking CT I hate

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.169 
the downside is it by freaking CT I hate
CTE<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.590> my<00:00:29.250> customers<00:00:29.429> HCT

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
CTE I think a lot of my customers HCT

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.690 
CTE I think a lot of my customers HCT
but<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:31.320> make<00:00:31.500> pretty<00:00:31.769> okay<00:00:32.369> looking

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

just as a display model so i'll do an

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970 
just as a display model so i'll do an
unboxing<00:00:41.579> later<00:00:42.350> when<00:00:43.350> i<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> full<00:00:43.770> model

like so here we go whoo so here is the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.619 
like so here we go whoo so here is the
CT<00:00:57.510> warp<00:00:58.050> elite<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.910> looks<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.239> huge

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
CT warp elite if it looks like it's huge

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
CT warp elite if it looks like it's huge
it's<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> freaking<00:01:01.649> huge<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's because it's freaking huge this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's because it's freaking huge this
thing<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> let's<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.719> big<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.199> thing

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260

it's like how big this Jesus Christ
5.5<00:01:10.979> inches<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.049> point<00:01:13.049> 2<00:01:13.290> inches<00:01:13.650> smaller

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
5.5 inches so point 2 inches smaller

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.490 
5.5 inches so point 2 inches smaller
than<00:01:14.250> freakin<00:01:14.990> boots<00:01:15.990> max<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.040> let's<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:18.500> okay

than freakin boots max so let's see okay
so<00:01:19.560> here's<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> boost<00:01:20.520> max<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.159> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so here's the boost max and here is the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.420 
so here's the boost max and here is the
lead<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.210> compare<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> their

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.920 
is to know how much storage all i get so
so<00:04:00.810> memory<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> has<00:04:01.350> 16<00:04:01.860> gigabyte<00:04:02.220> internal

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
so memory it has 16 gigabyte internal

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.040 
so memory it has 16 gigabyte internal
storage<00:04:04.010> that's<00:04:05.010> raw<00:04:05.550> hardware<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.240> then<00:04:06.720> 10

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
storage that's raw hardware and then 10

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.720 
storage that's raw hardware and then 10
gigabytes<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.740> internal<00:04:07.860> storage<00:04:08.250> available

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
gigabytes of internal storage available

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.040 
gigabytes of internal storage available
to<00:04:09.390> user<00:04:09.570> 2<00:04:10.050> gigabytes<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:11.239> ram

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
to user 2 gigabytes of ram

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.680 
to user 2 gigabytes of ram
so<00:04:13.920> basically<00:04:14.190> available<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.060> says<00:04:15.300> 10

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
so basically available it says 10

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.690 
so basically available it says 10
gigabytes<00:04:16.260> guys<00:04:16.590> 10<00:04:17.010> gigabytes<00:04:17.549> are

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
gigabytes guys 10 gigabytes are

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.979 
gigabytes guys 10 gigabytes are
available<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.540> user<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.730> then<00:04:21.360> like<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.810> 2

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
available to the user and then like I 2

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.820 
available to the user and then like I 2
gigabytes<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.560> RAM<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.870> course<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.200> has<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> 16

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
gigabytes of RAM so of course I has a 16

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.530 
gigabytes of RAM so of course I has a 16
gigabytes<00:04:26.220> but<00:04:26.460> everybody<00:04:27.030> knows<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> system

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
gigabytes but everybody knows the system

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.110 
gigabytes but everybody knows the system
uses<00:04:27.840> some<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:28.770> for<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> user<00:04:29.580> it's<00:04:29.850> 10

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
uses some of it so for the user it's 10

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.490 
uses some of it so for the user it's 10
gigabytes<00:04:30.510> that's<00:04:30.720> that's<00:04:31.050> freaking<00:04:31.440> amazing

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
gigabytes that's that's freaking amazing

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.770 
gigabytes that's that's freaking amazing
guys<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.030> highest<00:04:33.360> one<00:04:33.570> that<00:04:33.720> I

to 64 gigabyte SD card in it let's see

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.840 
to 64 gigabyte SD card in it let's see
it<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.550> 3g<00:04:50.970> /<00:04:51.210> 4G<00:04:52.160> like<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.370> can<00:04:53.490> put<00:04:53.610> up<00:04:53.670> to

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
it is 3g / 4G like so you can put up to

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.830 
it is 3g / 4G like so you can put up to
a<00:04:53.880> 64<00:04:54.630> gigabyte<00:04:55.050> SD<00:04:55.290> card<00:04:59.420> let's<00:05:00.420> about<00:05:00.600> it<00:05:00.720> in
