there's a lot of tiny details that I
still<00:02:03.580> need<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.820> work<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.540> for

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
still need to work on I know for

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.270 
still need to work on I know for
instance<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.670> potato<00:02:07.090> mine<00:02:07.739> even<00:02:08.739> though<00:02:08.920> he

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
instance the potato mine even though he

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.030 
instance the potato mine even though he
shows<00:02:09.489> up<00:02:09.670> fun<00:02:09.880> here<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.239> game<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:11.770> use<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
shows up fun here in game they use a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.130 
shows up fun here in game they use a
different<00:02:12.280> icon<00:02:12.640> up<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.540> seed<00:02:13.780> card

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
different icon up here for the seed card

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.130 
different icon up here for the seed card
and<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.190> shows<00:02:15.430> up<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.720> original

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and so it shows up as the original

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.810 
and so it shows up as the original
potato<00:02:17.470> mine<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.950> there<00:02:17.980> which<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.489> not<00:02:18.640> what

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
potato mine up there which is not what

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.960 
potato mine up there which is not what
we<00:02:18.910> want<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:20.590> I've<00:02:21.340> used<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.730> slightly

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
we want now I've used a slightly

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.520 
we want now I've used a slightly
different<00:02:22.180> color<00:02:22.540> palette<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:22.959> each<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
different color palette for each of the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.280 
different color palette for each of the
levels<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.630> done<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:26.050> than<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
levels I have not done more than a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.260 
levels I have not done more than a
recolor<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.370> some<00:02:27.550> effects<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
recolor and some effects on the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
recolor and some effects on the
backgrounds<00:02:28.810> themselves<00:02:29.350> just<00:02:30.040> because<00:02:30.370> I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
backgrounds themselves just because I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.890

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
I'm also slipping focus on this so I

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.170

the snow pea and the pea shooter and the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
sunflower all use the same leaves and

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.320 
sunflower all use the same leaves and
stem<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.650> because<00:04:39.610> they<00:04:39.910> have<00:04:40.090> all<00:04:40.240> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
stem this is because they have all the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.000 
stem this is because they have all the

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.219 
sprites chopped up into pieces they're
not<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.639> picture<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:43.120> each<00:04:43.360> which

not just like a picture of each which

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.170 
not just like a picture of each which
means<00:04:44.560> it<00:04:44.800> takes<00:04:44.949> a<00:04:45.130> lot<00:04:45.310> longer<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.850> should

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
means it takes a lot longer that should

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.150 
means it takes a lot longer that should
