00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
kind of looks like a world war gun but
yeah<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.920> guess<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.090> modern<00:01:42.450> i<00:01:42.570> guess

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
yeah i guess it's kind of modern i guess

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
yeah i guess it's kind of modern i guess
now<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.710> anyways<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.549> i<00:01:44.579> only<00:01:45.060> assault<00:01:45.540> got

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
now but anyways so i only assault got

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.920 
now but anyways so i only assault got
their<00:01:45.930> new<00:01:46.350> weapon<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.630> they're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
their new weapon but I'm think they're

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.069 
their new weapon but I'm think they're
going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> upload<00:01:49.850> more<00:01:50.850> weapons<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> couple

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
going to upload more weapons in a couple

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.609 
going to upload more weapons in a couple
of<00:01:52.110> days<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.710> probably<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.369> week<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
of days or probably in a week or so and

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.730 
of days or probably in a week or so and
that<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.600> assault<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that is it for the assault and all the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.429 
that is it for the assault and all the
guns<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.250> far<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> assault<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.229> their

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
guns so far just the assault got their

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.370 
guns so far just the assault got their
weapon<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.060> surprising<00:02:03.240> becomes<00:02:04.229> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
weapon and that is surprising becomes a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.859 
weapon and that is surprising becomes a
prize<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.610> honest<00:02:05.969> with<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> guys<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
prize to be honest with you guys it is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.229 
prize to be honest with you guys it is
pretty<00:02:07.619> surprising<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.489> they<00:02:08.849> only<00:02:09.030> have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
pretty surprising like they only have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.530 
pretty surprising like they only have
the<00:02:09.330> assault<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.840> far<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.619> ah<00:02:10.979> here's<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> few

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the assault so far but ah here's the few

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.160 
the assault so far but ah here's the few
new<00:02:12.660> mask

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
new mask

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.830 
new mask
there's<00:02:13.440> called<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.040> firefighter<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
there's called a firefighter and I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.479 
there's called a firefighter and I

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
actually like this one it's kind of

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.150 
actually like this one it's kind of
funny<00:02:17.700> though<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> donate<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.920> guy's

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
man remind me of someone and then it's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
man remind me of someone and then it's
the<00:02:30.060> laboratory<00:02:30.450> world<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.020> anyways<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.860> is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the laboratory world but anyways it is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.910 
the laboratory world but anyways it is
pretty<00:02:32.370> cool<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.630> be<00:02:34.050> invisible

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
