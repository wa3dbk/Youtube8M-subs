 try to figure out the tattoos then 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.660
 balanced and deliberately over the years or when 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.329
 rantka in other words now i'm just 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.930
 not Ogurtsova in general as someone comfortable 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.180
 mostly not marrying a nice look 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.670

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.740

 associated with them yes and funny 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.890
 the story is related to the tattoo i mean i 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.680
 used to be married and my husband and I 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.509
 the former have already met and literally 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.429
 a month later we made tattoos with 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.220
 friend's initials yes that is and so cute 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.200
 his tenderness is in my p. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.840
 and that's when we fold sternly che 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.670
 got the word ass and then because 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.289
 we are precisely created for another but it turned out 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
 what is something that would characterize our 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.240
 marriage but I really liked to start such 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.119
 small ass 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.159
 Siversky butt so you stayed 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.420
 Yes, I will not cook this party 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.819
 I will not score because it is good 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.470
 the memory of the series we had a wonderful 2 and 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.920
 let it be a tattoo with me 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 forever and somewhere in the world 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.500
 the second half is not bad how far 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 are you ready to go beating yourself that is 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.780
 there is some scope there somewhere never 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.369
 not shagnesh Well, actually you do not want 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.869
 peeking after every tattoo i'm 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.340
 say that all tattoo is last 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.739
 nothing more I will not do that is so 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 was with my 1 2 34 5 and when do 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.799
 hands I said that all this fucking and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.840
 I will not tolerate bad eating it 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.970
 I react to temperature 39 and then 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 I sleep for two days but thrown as it was 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.950
 a year has passed I already scored another 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.329
 tattooed and now i'm a gentle dream sketch 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 that is, it will be a big job from 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.239
 chest up to my knees and i'm getting ready for 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.980
 this is morally if i led 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.510
 and there with large gaps then in 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.829
 how much will I score 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.579
 never scared to imagine famously 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.670
 to 23 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.070
 soon i'll start maybe in 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.209
 process account that individual places 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.630
 for centuries that's cool but that is there face and 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.250
 brushes on her face also planned to do 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.290
 yourself a small tattoo but still mom 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.269
 mother asks not to do this and grandmother 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.530
 against them as if their land 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.840
 relatives generally every trail 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 My mom approves first our sketch 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.800
 she looks me right here on choose 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.629
 Here too dark let's remade 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.470
 and when Brad is beautiful only if and 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.760
 tattoo do that like in spite of 25 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.659
 chief adviser 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.920
 wrong here are your tattoos they 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.159
 bother you or somehow 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.099
 companion life help can be 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.900
 Of course itâ€™s very difficult sometimes because 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.600
 I used to have a music school 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.700
 rannet where they came 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 small children are little older and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.810
 adults also were first here 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.210
 We spoke about me as an excellent 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.010
 the teacher is better is not easy we 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.080
 so glad our child so relaxed 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.410
 and when he does not see me there are shirts in 1 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.950
 short sleeve starts here land 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.010
 take away the bad teach well and everyone 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.450
 hospitals for a bunch of grandmas it's right there 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.960
 spit in my back or cross over there 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.850
 start to read prayers all sorts of salary 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.710
 drunk from the subway naturally this is the most 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.590
 the main moonshine question score sat and 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.170
 how much and for what and in general is normal 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980
 what is not very happy in this topic 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.080
 social networks 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.820
 when people see me with tattoos and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.500
 Immediately begin to write a message series about 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.480
 tattooed right man army 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.280
 rock that is, I understand that if there is 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.870
 tattoo you immediately play rock even 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.740
 if this is the group we will look when I 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.750
 did a tattoo 1 of 1 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.130
 this is necessarily an attribute of rock music but 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.950
 No, I play pop music despite the fact that 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.840
 All the movie is like a place 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.970
 and if that is done until once again I 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.920
 just not really yes I started to stray 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.170
 pike before played in a group of ratenki it was 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.180
 scary because kids horror me 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.740
 looked could not understand that it was me 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.270
 sometimes I had to say that not 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.070
 worry it will get away soon 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.260
 platform marker addressed time 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.390
 our young viewers and all those 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.100
 kids who would like to do 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.770
 tattooed maybe they somehow 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.170
 hesitate to think you need unnecessary what are you 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.280
 I am ready to advise the most important thing that I 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.330
 I want to say this is what you do not need 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.100
 follow the fashion 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.840
 that is, I occasionally observe something 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.360
 you can achieve hieroglyphs all at once 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.580
 vorogov it is fashionable beading feathers yourself 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.590
 here all at once with feathers dream catchers 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.090
 all at once on the tanks dream catchers that is 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.560
 don't do it need to think like 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.600
 you sit that you close what you 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.910
 I like it personally, so I mean 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.620
 think of a picture I draw this sketch 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.360
 two years sketch ron two years lies 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.970
 I have a table in a box that is, and I 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.560
 I hope bank tijuka I invent 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.930
 the place is the engine is not worth me already 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.580
 it seems to me it would be crammed all but 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.800
 as I give myself time 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.689
 somehow I think some work they 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.280
 eventually disappears, and now this is my 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.210
