hair previous to this install was all
the<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.820> down<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> middle<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.870> my<00:01:01.079> back

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the way down to the middle of my back

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.030 
the way down to the middle of my back
and<00:01:01.789> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> did<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> cut<00:01:04.830> out

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and what I did is that when I cut out

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
and what I did is that when I cut out
the<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.640> hair<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.270> used<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> make<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the other hair I used it to make a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.670 
the other hair I used it to make a
shorter<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> had<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.090> leftover

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
shorter one and then I had some leftover

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.270 
shorter one and then I had some leftover
longer<00:01:10.680> lengths<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:12.740> once<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.890> kept<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
longer lengths to kind of once I kept on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
longer lengths to kind of once I kept on
going<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.119> would<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.780> longer

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
going on it would be a little bit longer

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.969 
going on it would be a little bit longer
to<00:01:16.200> come<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:18.229> didn't<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.619> enough

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to come down but I didn't have enough

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.200 
to come down but I didn't have enough
hair<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.560> play<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hair to kind of play with and get a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
hair to kind of play with and get a
length<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.259> shape<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
length where I can actually shape it to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
length where I can actually shape it to
a<00:01:25.979> proper<00:01:26.280> shape<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> find<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.330> still

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a proper shape that I find but it still

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.100 
a proper shape that I find but it still
turned<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:27.990> turned<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.560> descent<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
turned it out turned out descent so

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.640 
turned it out turned out descent so
right<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.270> longer<00:01:33.270> length<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
right here is the longer length of the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.340 
right here is the longer length of the
leftover<00:01:35.579> braids<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> had<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.200> the

like<00:01:42.150> 100<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.960> side<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> shaped

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
like 100 on this side but it's shaped

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
like 100 on this side but it's shaped
like<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:48.380> because<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.770> had<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:51.420> that

gonna have a shorter hair and then as

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.190 
gonna have a shorter hair and then as
you<00:03:33.989> can<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.799> kind<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.190> did<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.200> invisible

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
you can see I kind of did the invisible

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.949 
you can see I kind of did the invisible
parts<00:03:37.620> when<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.489> do<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> invisible<00:03:39.390> parts

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
parts when you do do the invisible parts

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.259 
parts when you do do the invisible parts
sometimes<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.620> hair<00:03:40.860> tends<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> go<00:03:41.730> like<00:03:41.970> that

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
sometimes the hair tends to go like that

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.789 
sometimes the hair tends to go like that
so<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.709> did<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.519> hold<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:46.079> the

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
so what I did is I hold the the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.130 
so what I did is I hold the the
blow-dryer<00:03:47.640> up<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.209> for<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.660> couple<00:03:49.049> of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
blow-dryer up here for like a couple of

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.199 
blow-dryer up here for like a couple of
seconds<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.829> then<00:03:50.430> that's<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:50.970> kind<00:03:51.150> of

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
seconds and then that's it just kind of

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.910 
seconds and then that's it just kind of
going<00:03:51.450> over<00:03:51.600> like<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.769> and

going over like that and that's it and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.310 
going over like that and that's it and
it<00:03:53.010> should<00:03:53.340> way<00:03:54.000> over<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.329> going<00:03:55.049> over<00:03:55.260> it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
it should way over like going over it

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.349 
it should way over like going over it
twice<00:03:55.650> do<00:03:55.950> not<00:03:56.220> hold<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.730> there<00:03:56.910> for<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.180> long

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
twice do not hold it there for a long

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.330 
twice do not hold it there for a long
time<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:58.019> kind<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.350> go<00:03:58.590> over<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.980> like<00:03:59.130> this

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340

like<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.450> only<00:04:00.630> reason<00:04:01.170> why<00:04:01.200> I'm<00:04:01.470> doing

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
like that the only reason why I'm doing

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.599 
like that the only reason why I'm doing
like<00:04:02.220> an<00:04:02.370> explanation<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:04.609> don't

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
like an explanation is because I don't

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.050 
like an explanation is because I don't
have<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.269> tools<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.959> need<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.500> mount<00:04:08.220> my

hands and show you guys my braiding
technique<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:18.889> basically<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:20.900> coin<00:04:21.900> ruled<00:04:22.169> it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
technique is basically a coin ruled it

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.530 
technique is basically a coin ruled it
back<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.070> middle<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.669> stopped<00:04:24.300> at<00:04:24.450> the

cornered<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.990> here<00:04:28.380> Corner<00:04:29.370> corner<00:04:29.639> oh<00:04:29.850> and

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
cornered it here Corner corner oh and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.180 
cornered it here Corner corner oh and
the<00:04:30.510> part<00:04:30.840> right<00:04:31.290> here<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.940> got<00:04:33.900> smaller<00:04:34.470> closer

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
the part right here I got smaller closer

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.980 
the part right here I got smaller closer
to<00:04:35.490> where<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.700> want<00:04:36.150> there<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.360> be<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.630> part

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
to where I want there to be a part

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.840 
to where I want there to be a part
because<00:04:37.800> I'm<00:04:37.919> not<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.250> brains<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.669> be<00:04:38.760> as

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
because I'm not the brains to be as

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.870 
because I'm not the brains to be as
close<00:04:39.090> as<00:04:39.330> possible<00:04:40.130> where<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.310> part<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.700> not

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
close as possible where the part is not

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.170 
close as possible where the part is not
they<00:04:42.300> could<00:04:42.360> be<00:04:42.540> bigger

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
they could be bigger

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.640 
they could be bigger
there's<00:04:45.180> probably<00:04:45.540> approximately<00:04:45.960> 1<00:04:46.860> 2<00:04:47.550> 3<00:04:48.060> 4<00:04:48.990> 5

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
there's probably approximately 1 2 3 4 5

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.540 
there's probably approximately 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:04:50.960> 7<00:04:51.960> 8<00:04:52.169> 9<00:04:52.560> 10<00:04:53.070> 11<00:04:53.400> 12<00:04:53.960> 12<00:04:54.960> braids<00:04:55.950> going<00:04:56.310> across

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 braids going across

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.840 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 braids going across
at<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.850> top<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.540> then<00:04:58.169> I<00:04:58.200> kind<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.850> joined

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
at the top and then I kind of joined

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.370 
at the top and then I kind of joined
them<00:04:59.970> all<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.360> other<00:05:00.450> corner<00:05:00.990> right<00:05:01.350> here

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
them all to the other corner right here

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.760 
them all to the other corner right here
so<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:02.130> could<00:05:02.669> look<00:05:03.080> natural<00:05:04.080> much<00:05:04.560> more

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
so that it could look natural much more

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.010 
so that it could look natural much more
natural<00:05:05.190> when<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.729> kind<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.240> do<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.990> same

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
natural when I kind of do the same

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.950 
natural when I kind of do the same
technique<00:05:08.010> as<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.550> invisible<00:05:09.330> part<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.810> I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
technique as the invisible part here I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.080 
technique as the invisible part here I
try<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.229> do<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.530> invisible<00:05:11.100> part<00:05:11.280> going

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
try to do the invisible part going

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.610 
try to do the invisible part going
backwards<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:13.169> you're<00:05:13.320> not<00:05:13.410> really

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
backwards so that you're not really

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.310 
backwards so that you're not really
seeing<00:05:13.860> too<00:05:14.070> much<00:05:14.190> knots<00:05:16.610> then<00:05:17.690> after<00:05:18.690> there<00:05:18.990> I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
seeing too much knots then after there I

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.070 
seeing too much knots then after there I
did<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.660> zigzag<00:05:21.800> braid<00:05:22.880> zigzag<00:05:23.880> zigzag<00:05:24.450> all<00:05:24.930> the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
did a zigzag braid zigzag zigzag all the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.080 
did a zigzag braid zigzag zigzag all the
way<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.470> bottom<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:26.010> then<00:05:26.610> any<00:05:26.850> loose

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
way to the bottom and then any loose

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.630 
way to the bottom and then any loose
hair<00:05:29.930> aye-aye-aye<00:05:32.720> so<00:05:33.720> would<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.229> to<00:05:34.919> my

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
hair aye-aye-aye so would it to my

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.900 
hair aye-aye-aye so would it to my
cornrows<00:05:36.410> I'm<00:05:37.410> just<00:05:37.680> explaining<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.430> wish<00:05:38.669> I

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
cornrows I'm just explaining I wish I

wanted<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.260> have<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.410> better<00:05:58.680> shape<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.190> wanted

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
wanted to have a better shape I wanted

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.180 
wanted to have a better shape I wanted
there<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.639> be<00:05:59.789> more<00:05:59.910> hair<00:06:00.419> but<00:06:00.810> again<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.289> didn't

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
there to be more hair but again I didn't

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.129 
there to be more hair but again I didn't
have<00:06:02.370> enough<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.030> longer<00:06:03.419> length<00:06:03.630> hair<00:06:03.930> so

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
have enough of the longer length hair so

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.540 
have enough of the longer length hair so
I<00:06:04.169> just<00:06:04.350> had<00:06:04.470> to<00:06:04.590> use<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.919> shorter<00:06:05.220> leg<00:06:05.370> that

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
I just had to use the shorter leg that

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.520 
I just had to use the shorter leg that
was<00:06:05.729> left<00:06:06.000> and<00:06:06.360> that's<00:06:06.900> what<00:06:07.139> it<00:06:07.200> looks<00:06:07.380> like

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
was left and that's what it looks like

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.379 
was left and that's what it looks like
this<00:06:07.650> but<00:06:07.889> I'm<00:06:07.979> still<00:06:08.370> satisfied<00:06:08.639> and<00:06:09.240> I'm

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
this but I'm still satisfied and I'm

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.080
