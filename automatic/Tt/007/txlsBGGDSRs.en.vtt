to the game Call of Duty advanced

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.780 
to the game Call of Duty advanced
warfare<00:00:38.170> but<00:00:38.680> like<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:38.920> said<00:00:39.220> if<00:00:39.400> you<00:00:39.490> take<00:00:39.760> a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
warfare but like I said if you take a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.360 
warfare but like I said if you take a
look<00:00:40.060> next<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.020> right<00:00:41.260> thumbstick<00:00:41.620> you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
look next to the right thumbstick you

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.700 
look next to the right thumbstick you
will<00:00:42.550> see<00:00:42.820> we<00:00:43.120> have<00:00:43.330> tally<00:00:43.720> marks<00:00:44.230> on<00:00:44.380> there

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
will see we have tally marks on there

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.040 
will see we have tally marks on there
now<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:44.920> believe<00:00:45.190> they<00:00:45.820> go<00:00:46.000> up<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.510> number<00:00:46.780> 9

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
now I believe they go up to the number 9

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.750 
now I believe they go up to the number 9
but<00:00:47.590> like<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.740> said<00:00:48.010> these<00:00:48.160> are<00:00:48.220> extremely

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
but like I said these are extremely

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.400 
but like I said these are extremely
random<00:00:49.270> everything<00:00:49.900> off<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.170> is

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
random everything off this is

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.830 
random everything off this is
referencing<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.310> the<00:00:51.700> game<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.120> where<00:00:52.690> have

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
referencing to the game and where have

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.050

ever seen tally marks is in call of duty
zombies<00:01:00.220> so<00:01:00.790> possibly<00:01:01.180> meaning<00:01:01.570> call<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.110> duty

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
zombies so possibly meaning call of duty

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.229 
zombies so possibly meaning call of duty
zombies<00:01:02.410> could<00:01:02.890> be<00:01:03.040> coming<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.460> call<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.910> duty

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
zombies could be coming to call of duty

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.389 
zombies could be coming to call of duty
advanced<00:01:04.689> warfare<00:01:04.809> now<00:01:05.530> some<00:01:06.009> of<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.220> may<00:01:06.250> be

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
advanced warfare now some of you may be

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.249 
advanced warfare now some of you may be
saying<00:01:06.640> okay<00:01:07.119> this<00:01:07.390> means<00:01:07.689> absolutely

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
saying okay this means absolutely

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.050 
saying okay this means absolutely
nothing<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:09.040> what<00:01:09.250> this<00:01:09.369> tally<00:01:09.610> marks<00:01:09.909> on

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
nothing so what this tally marks on

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.360 
nothing so what this tally marks on
there<00:01:10.270> why<00:01:10.840> would<00:01:11.080> they<00:01:11.260> just<00:01:11.470> randomly<00:01:11.740> put

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
there why would they just randomly put

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.610 
there why would they just randomly put
them<00:01:12.790> on<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.060> controller<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.050> doesn't<00:01:14.470> make

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
them on a controller it doesn't make

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.830 
them on a controller it doesn't make
sense<00:01:14.890> like<00:01:15.460> I<00:01:15.490> said<00:01:15.760> everything<00:01:16.420> off<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.690> is

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
sense like I said everything off that is

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.780 
sense like I said everything off that is
referencing<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.740> game<00:01:18.010> including<00:01:18.670> these

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
something and I really do honestly

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.760 
something and I really do honestly
believe<00:01:24.310> they<00:01:24.820> are<00:01:24.850> hinting<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.900> zombies<00:01:26.470> come

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
believe they are hinting to zombies come

but they have
revealed<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.159> yet<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> definitely<00:02:21.060> think

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
revealed it yet so I definitely think

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.899 
revealed it yet so I definitely think
that<00:02:21.750> mode<00:02:22.109> will<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.709> zombies<00:02:23.219> and<00:02:23.340> also<00:02:23.700> some

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
doesn't mean it actually has to relate

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.280 
doesn't mean it actually has to relate
to<00:02:44.040> previous<00:02:44.609> zombie<00:02:45.180> games<00:02:45.510> they<00:02:46.139> could

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
to previous zombie games they could

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.050 
to previous zombie games they could
actually<00:02:46.409> start<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.040> brand<00:02:47.250> new<00:02:47.370> storyline<00:02:47.909> you

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
know make it their own IP it totally

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.849 
know make it their own IP it totally
doesn't<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.599> link<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.439> any<00:02:52.709> other

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
zombies stuff we've seen before from
treyarch<00:02:54.689> so<00:02:55.169> obviously<00:02:55.590> they<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:56.040> make<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
treyarch so obviously they can make it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.159
