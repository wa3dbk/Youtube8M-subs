which is my camouflage nails as always

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.610 
which is my camouflage nails as always
we<00:00:05.580> start<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> good<00:00:06.569> base<00:00:06.810> coat<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.470> is

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
we start with a good base coat this is

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.129 
we start with a good base coat this is
nel<00:00:07.859> NP<00:00:08.250> by<00:00:08.400> OPI<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.840> because<00:00:09.929> it's

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
nel NP by OPI I use it because it's

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
nel NP by OPI I use it because it's
strengthening<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.670> color<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.120> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
strengthening the first color that you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390 
strengthening the first color that you
can<00:00:12.450> see<00:00:12.599> me<00:00:12.750> painting<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.349> here<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.830> navigate

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
can see me painting on here is navigate

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.250 
can see me painting on here is navigate
her<00:00:14.580> from<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> new<00:00:15.269> se<00:00:15.630> range<00:00:15.839> which<00:00:16.170> is

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
her from the new se range which is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.939 
her from the new se range which is
really<00:00:16.590> nice<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.750> other<00:00:19.140> se<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
really nice then we use this other se so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.420 
really nice then we use this other se so
psyched<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.910> start<00:00:21.240> doing<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
psyched and we start doing the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.279 
psyched and we start doing the
camouflage<00:00:23.430> blobs<00:00:25.460> I'm<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.939> quite<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> large

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
camouflage blobs I'm using quite a large

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.830 
camouflage blobs I'm using quite a large
dotting<00:00:29.250> tool<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> anything

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
dotting tool here if you have anything

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.950 
dotting tool here if you have anything
bigger<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.300> better

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
bigger to use it's probably better

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.479 
bigger to use it's probably better
because<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.530> takes<00:00:34.710> quite<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> time

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
because this takes quite a lot of time

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.700 
because this takes quite a lot of time
for<00:00:35.730> shapes<00:00:36.180> which<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.480> quite<00:00:36.660> big<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
for shapes which are quite big or you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
for shapes which are quite big or you
can<00:00:37.860> use<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> brush<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.640> you're<00:00:38.910> confident

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
can use a brush if you're confident

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.229 
can use a brush if you're confident
using<00:00:39.750> brushes<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.100> much<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.610> just

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
using brushes but I'm not so much I just

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.190 
using brushes but I'm not so much I just
draw<00:00:42.660> these<00:00:43.010> blobs<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.430> randomly<00:00:45.200> random

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
draw these blobs really randomly random

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.700 
draw these blobs really randomly random
shapes<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.770> random<00:00:47.100> places<00:00:47.309> along<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> nail

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
shapes and random places along the nail

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
shapes and random places along the nail
so<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.250> three<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.059> color

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
so I'm going to do three with this color

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
so I'm going to do three with this color
and<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> other<00:00:52.500> colors<00:00:52.800> I'll<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.399> or

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and for the other colors I'll do two or

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.290 
and for the other colors I'll do two or
three<00:00:53.789> each<00:00:54.000> doesn't<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.199> matter<00:00:56.300> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
three each doesn't really matter the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020 
three each doesn't really matter the
next<00:00:57.660> color<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.100> Barry<00:00:59.789> M

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
next color that we use is Barry M

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
next color that we use is Barry M
mushroom<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.320> use<00:01:01.440> any<00:01:02.149> shade<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
mushroom but you can use any shade of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.649 
mushroom but you can use any shade of
brown<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.850> as<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.000> said<00:01:06.240> we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
brown that you have and as I said we

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
brown that you have and as I said we
just<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.020> randomly<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> nail

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
just do it randomly all over the nail

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.380 
just do it randomly all over the nail
and<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:10.260> overlap<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> last<00:01:11.549> green

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.440 

if<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> take<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> look<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.369> some<00:01:17.580> pictures<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
if you take a look at some pictures of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
if you take a look at some pictures of
camouflage<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> sort<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> see<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.250> kind

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
camouflage you can sort of see what kind

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:31.870 
camouflage you can sort of see what kind
of<00:01:20.490> shapes<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:21.060> are

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.600 

the<00:01:32.479> final<00:01:33.140> green<00:01:33.409> we<00:01:33.680> use<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.219> bobbing<00:01:34.579> for

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
the final green we use is bobbing for

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.260 
the final green we use is bobbing for
baubles<00:01:35.030> from<00:01:35.689> se<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:37.310> doesn't<00:01:37.789> actually<00:01:37.850> look

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
baubles from se it doesn't actually look

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.240 
baubles from se it doesn't actually look
like<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.229> kind<00:01:39.439> of<00:01:39.500> Greenwood<00:01:39.950> see<00:01:40.100> only

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
like the kind of Greenwood see only

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.950 
like the kind of Greenwood see only
camouflage<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:41.149> such<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.600> pretty<00:01:41.810> color

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
camouflage but it's such a pretty color

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.029 
camouflage but it's such a pretty color
I<00:01:42.320> wanted<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.740> use<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.270> hand<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.619> does<00:01:45.829> all

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
I wanted to use it hand and it does all

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.679 
I wanted to use it hand and it does all
tie<00:01:46.250> together<00:01:46.310> quite<00:01:46.909> well<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.149> it's<00:01:47.600> not

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
tie together quite well so it's not

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.330 
tie together quite well so it's not
really<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:48.229> don't<00:01:48.920> think<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.100> really<00:01:49.130> matters

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
really I don't think it really matters

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.080 
really I don't think it really matters
too<00:01:50.179> much<00:01:50.869> what<00:01:51.140> colors<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:51.560> choose<00:01:52.090> just

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
too much what colors you choose just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.999 
too much what colors you choose just
grab<00:01:53.360> any<00:01:53.539> green<00:01:53.869> or<00:01:54.259> brown<00:01:54.409> that<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.829> have

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.080 
grab any green or brown that you have
and<00:01:56.380> he<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.560> see<00:01:57.740> all<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.130> them<00:01:58.220> together<00:01:58.399> and

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
and he can see all of them together and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.840 
and he can see all of them together and
I<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.479> matte<00:01:59.810> top<00:02:00.049> coat<00:02:00.549> which<00:02:01.549> really

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I do a matte top coat which really

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.309 
I do a matte top coat which really
finishes<00:02:02.360> off<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.539> look<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.990> looks<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.229> bit

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
finishes off the look it looks a bit

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:11.770 
finishes off the look it looks a bit
weird<00:02:03.380> shining<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.420> number<00:02:05.750> 17<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.780> hear

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
you can see how well they camouflage
