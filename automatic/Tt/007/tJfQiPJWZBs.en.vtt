00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.139 

okay<00:00:01.800> in<00:00:02.010> today's<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.090> to

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay in today's video we're going to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.150 
okay in today's video we're going to
discuss<00:00:03.300> antibodies<00:00:04.290> as<00:00:04.529> quickly<00:00:04.920> as

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
discuss antibodies as quickly as

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.730 
discuss antibodies as quickly as
possible<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.150> as<00:00:06.390> much<00:00:06.569> detail<00:00:07.049> as<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.560> can

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
possible and in as much detail as we can

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.589 
possible and in as much detail as we can
so<00:00:08.280> antibodies<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:10.010> proteins<00:00:13.040> okay<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
so antibodies are proteins okay and

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.779 
so antibodies are proteins okay and
another<00:00:15.599> name<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.789> immunoglobulin

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
another name for them is immunoglobulin

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.939 
another name for them is immunoglobulin
now<00:00:18.630> if<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.400> at<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> structure<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
now if you look at a structure of a

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
now if you look at a structure of a
antibody<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.609> looks<00:00:23.820> something<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
antibody it looks something like this

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
antibody it looks something like this
they're<00:00:26.310> dots<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.420> connected

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
they're dots and then it's connected

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
they're dots and then it's connected
like<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.340> like<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.970> there's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
like this like this and then there's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.010 
like this like this and then there's
another<00:00:30.510> region<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
another region here so this here is the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.150 
another region here so this here is the
simplified<00:00:34.020> version<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
simplified version this is what it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.650 
simplified version this is what it
actually<00:00:35.309> looks<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.820> something<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually looks like something like this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.190 
actually looks like something like this
but<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.250> simple<00:00:38.940> version<00:00:39.200> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
but this is a simple version and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.520 
but this is a simple version and
remember<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.710> are<00:00:40.829> proteins<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.530> this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
remember they are proteins we have this

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.520 
remember they are proteins we have this
region<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.899> which<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> constant<00:00:47.180> body

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
region here which is the constant body

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
region here which is the constant body
so<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:50.219> antibodies<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> usually

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so in all antibodies this is usually

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.709 
so in all antibodies this is usually
going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> same<00:00:52.430> we<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.719> these

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to be the same we have these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
going to be the same we have these
little<00:00:55.230> red<00:00:55.500> tips<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.430> can

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
little red tips I don't know if you can

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
little red tips I don't know if you can
see<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> color<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> ends<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> them

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
see from the color but the ends of them

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
see from the color but the ends of them
are<00:00:58.530> red<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.329> variable

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
are red these are the very variable

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.910 
are red these are the very variable
bodies<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.809> between<00:01:03.809> different<00:01:03.960> classes<00:01:04.739> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
bodies and between different classes of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
bodies and between different classes of
antibodies<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.939> change<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.570> terms<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
antibodies they can change in terms of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
antibodies they can change in terms of
their<00:01:07.680> structure<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.420> middle

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
their structure now we have this middle

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.649 
their structure now we have this middle
bit<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.549> okay<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> heavy<00:01:13.229> chains

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
bit here okay these are the heavy chains

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
bit here okay these are the heavy chains
heavy<00:01:16.850> chains<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.830> we<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.040> these<00:01:20.640> ones<00:01:20.970> here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
heavy chains and we have these ones here

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.960 
heavy chains and we have these ones here
on<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> these<00:01:23.549> are<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> light

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
on this side and these are the light

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.469 
on this side and these are the light
chains<00:01:27.950> okay<00:01:29.329> now<00:01:31.159> these<00:01:32.159> regions<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.090> are

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
chains okay now these regions here are

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
chains okay now these regions here are
the<00:01:34.380> antigen<00:01:35.070> binding<00:01:35.100> sites<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> where

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the antigen binding sites this is where

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
the antigen binding sites this is where
the<00:01:36.630> antigen<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.439> bind<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.400> antibody

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the antigen will bind to the antibody

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
the antigen will bind to the antibody
but<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.770> understand<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but we don't really understand at the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
but we don't really understand at the
moment<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.630> far<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> video<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:44.130> do

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
moment so far is the video on what do

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.210 
moment so far is the video on what do
antibodies<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.110> let's<00:01:46.350> discuss<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.009> now

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
antibodies do so let's discuss this now

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.660 
antibodies do so let's discuss this now
so<00:01:47.880> antibodies<00:01:48.509> work<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.740> immune<00:01:50.159> system

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so antibodies work in the immune system

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.240 
so antibodies work in the immune system
they<00:01:50.880> are<00:01:50.909> very<00:01:51.450> important<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
they are very important that's a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010 
they are very important that's a
characteristic<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.360> structural

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
characteristic or structural

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.100 
characteristic or structural
characteristic<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.490> immune<00:01:56.820> system<00:01:57.329> now

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
characteristic of the immune system now

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.319 
characteristic of the immune system now
they<00:01:58.350> work<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.979> the<00:02:00.110> two<00:02:01.110> sort<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> mechanisms

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
they work on the two sort of mechanisms

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.100 
they work on the two sort of mechanisms
detection<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.500> foreign<00:02:04.500> bodies<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.100> response

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
detection of foreign bodies and response

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
detection of foreign bodies and response
to<00:02:07.110> foreign<00:02:07.320> bodies<00:02:07.740> I'll<00:02:07.920> write<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.220> down

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to foreign bodies I'll write this down

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.450 
to foreign bodies I'll write this down
so<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:09.330> work<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
so they work on the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.810 
so they work on the
detection<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:14.560> response<00:02:17.620> okay<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:19.610> we've

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
detection and response okay now we've

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.940 
detection and response okay now we've
looked<00:02:20.180> into<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> structure<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.680> let's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
looked into the structure here so let's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.060 
looked into the structure here so let's
look<00:02:22.130> at<00:02:22.280> how<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:23.050> affects<00:02:24.050> its<00:02:24.260> function<00:02:24.740> so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
look at how this affects its function so

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.160 
look at how this affects its function so
the<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.240> an<00:02:26.540> antibody<00:02:28.150> detects<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.450> responds

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
the way an antibody detects and responds

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.100 
the way an antibody detects and responds
is<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.980> any<00:02:31.660> type<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.830> tagging<00:02:33.830> or<00:02:35.110> binding

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
is in any type of tagging or binding

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.270 
is in any type of tagging or binding
mechanism<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.790> tag<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:39.760> bind<00:02:40.760> onto<00:02:42.280> foreign

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
mechanism they tag and bind onto foreign

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.010 
mechanism they tag and bind onto foreign
bodies<00:02:43.640> or<00:02:43.940> more<00:02:44.390> specifically<00:02:45.280> antigens

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
bodies or more specifically antigens

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.500 
bodies or more specifically antigens
this<00:02:48.020> is<00:02:48.200> what<00:02:48.380> they<00:02:48.590> bind<00:02:48.950> onto<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:49.970> what<00:02:50.360> are

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
this is what they bind onto now what are

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
this is what they bind onto now what are
antigens<00:02:51.640> antigens<00:02:52.640> are<00:02:52.910> very<00:02:53.450> small

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
antigens antigens are very small

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.270 
antigens antigens are very small
molecules<00:02:55.190> which<00:02:55.880> contained<00:02:57.010> epitopes<00:02:58.010> on

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
molecules which contained epitopes on

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.510 
molecules which contained epitopes on
their<00:02:58.940> surfaces<00:02:59.540> this<00:03:00.200> helps<00:03:00.710> in<00:03:00.890> terms<00:03:01.250> of

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
their surfaces this helps in terms of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.500 
their surfaces this helps in terms of
the<00:03:01.640> recognition

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the recognition

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.430 
the recognition
these<00:03:03.170> are<00:03:04.750> polysaccharides<00:03:05.750> well<00:03:06.170> they<00:03:06.290> can

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
these are polysaccharides well they can

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.010 
these are polysaccharides well they can
be<00:03:06.530> probably<00:03:06.770> saccharides<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:08.300> antigen

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
be probably saccharides and the antigen

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.060 
be probably saccharides and the antigen
will<00:03:09.410> bind<00:03:10.390> onto<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> like<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.080> remember<00:03:12.710> has

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
will bind onto it like this remember has

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.030 
will bind onto it like this remember has
a<00:03:13.100> y-shaped<00:03:13.450> structure<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:15.260> antibodies

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
a y-shaped structure so antibodies

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
a y-shaped structure so antibodies
themselves<00:03:17.530> here<00:03:18.700> they<00:03:19.700> are<00:03:20.500> produced<00:03:21.500> by

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
themselves here they are produced by

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.920 
themselves here they are produced by
b-cells

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
b-cells

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.580 
b-cells
or<00:03:25.120> plasma<00:03:26.120> cells<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:28.510> they<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.810> appear<00:03:30.350> on

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
or plasma cells and they can appear on

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.280 
or plasma cells and they can appear on
the<00:03:31.570> surface<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:34.430> cell<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.660> we<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.050> cell

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
the surface of a cell so we have a cell

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.740 
the surface of a cell so we have a cell
here<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.740> they<00:03:37.310> can<00:03:37.520> be<00:03:37.700> present<00:03:38.270> on<00:03:38.600> the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
here and they can be present on the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.230 
here and they can be present on the
surface<00:03:38.960> like<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:40.220> they<00:03:40.880> can<00:03:41.090> be

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
surface like this or they can be

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.050 
surface like this or they can be
secreted<00:03:41.570> for<00:03:42.260> example<00:03:42.620> into<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:42.950> blood<00:03:43.280> so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
secreted for example into the blood so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.930 
secreted for example into the blood so
you<00:03:44.150> have<00:03:44.450> red<00:03:44.690> blood<00:03:44.900> cells<00:03:45.140> here<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.940> then

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you have red blood cells here and then

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.670 
you have red blood cells here and then
you<00:03:47.240> have<00:03:47.450> antigen<00:03:47.960> antibodies<00:03:48.970> like<00:03:49.970> this

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
you have antigen antibodies like this

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.860 
you have antigen antibodies like this
okay<00:03:51.710> now<00:03:52.460> we<00:03:53.000> know<00:03:53.270> that<00:03:54.070> the<00:03:55.870> antibodies

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
okay now we know that the antibodies

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.610 
okay now we know that the antibodies
will<00:03:57.230> bind<00:03:57.260> onto<00:03:58.040> antigens<00:03:58.880> here<00:03:59.440> well<00:04:00.440> in

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
will bind onto antigens here well in

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.650 
will bind onto antigens here well in
this<00:04:00.860> sort<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.220> way<00:04:01.460> but<00:04:01.490> what<00:04:01.940> does<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.330> do

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
this sort of way but what does this do

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.230 
this sort of way but what does this do
this<00:04:05.290> binding<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> antigen<00:04:07.340> what<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.000> does

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
this binding to the antigen what it does

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.170 
this binding to the antigen what it does
is<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:09.080> initiates<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:10.190> sort<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.000> like<00:04:11.150> a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
is it initiates a sort of like a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.060 
is it initiates a sort of like a
recognition<00:04:11.840> from<00:04:12.520> one<00:04:13.520> second

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
recognition from one second

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.220 
recognition from one second
from<00:04:16.070> T<00:04:16.370> cells<00:04:17.050> T<00:04:18.050> cells<00:04:18.220> will<00:04:19.220> recognize<00:04:20.230> this

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
from T cells T cells will recognize this

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.920 
from T cells T cells will recognize this
antibody<00:04:22.220> has<00:04:22.520> binded<00:04:23.090> onto<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.510> antigen

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
antibody has binded onto this antigen

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.210 
antibody has binded onto this antigen
and<00:04:24.350> what<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> will<00:04:25.580> do<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.270> will<00:04:26.420> attack<00:04:26.900> and

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
and what I will do is it will attack and

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.730 
and what I will do is it will attack and
engulf<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:29.240> foreign<00:04:29.600> body<00:04:29.840> because<00:04:30.380> we<00:04:30.590> do

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
engulf the foreign body because we do

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.920 
engulf the foreign body because we do
not<00:04:30.860> want<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.430> antigen<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.180> our<00:04:32.330> body<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.810> a

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
not want this antigen in our body it's a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.610 
not want this antigen in our body it's a
foreign<00:04:33.350> body<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.980> we<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:35.120> body<00:04:35.380> wants<00:04:36.380> to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
foreign body and we the body wants to

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.820 
foreign body and we the body wants to
remove<00:04:36.950> this<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.580> will<00:04:37.730> engulf<00:04:38.830> this

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
remove this so it will engulf this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.210 
remove this so it will engulf this
antibody<00:04:40.550> antigen<00:04:41.710> these<00:04:42.710> are<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:42.980> main
