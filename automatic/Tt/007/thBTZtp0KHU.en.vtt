00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:42.900
 here's an example of how 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:44.040
 try to remove the air filter not 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.430
 disconnecting 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.830
 expansion tank brake system 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 if you leave the casing in place but 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.970
 due to the fact that I had already shot 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.379
 filter and once connected 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:11.220
 rivers sang gum right here's the filter 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:16.440
 I managed to remove without removing the skin but 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.400
 at the same time here take out the box itself is not 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.850
 removing the tank 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.460
 I can not but really break out 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:36.060
 here is this thing up what's on your car and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:38.750
 he doesn't want to do anymore 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.750
 sell 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:57.299
 on the filter housing there is such a one 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 groove in it is a rubber grip on the engine 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.929
 fixed here such a retainer here 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.310
 this groove should go in here 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:12.610
 top of the retainer if we don't 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.170
 remove the protective battery cover 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.269
 it is very difficult to put you in this 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.549
 retainer it turns out that we just lay down 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.420
 filter on top but already installed housing 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.599
 air filter on the intake manifold 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.650
 and combined 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.650
 respectively pass on the filter and lock 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.150
 on the engine case yet 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.299
 wrapped up here is a detachment screw 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.019
 the filter should already be 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.609
 firmly after that it is fixed already 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.299
 here is this screw that is how you see 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.069
 in this way you can check 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.940
 correct fixing of the filter housing 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.940
 on the engine 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.590
 but can you do all these 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.590
 procedures without removing 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.400
 expansion tank and battery and 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.630
 battery case 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.319
 This you already decide themselves gum when not 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.209
 enough space for installation 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.209
 filter housing in place
