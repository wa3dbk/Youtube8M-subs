up really fast and it's really good so I

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.100 
up really fast and it's really good so I
ears<00:04:25.010> ears<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.640> deal<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:26.000> takes<00:04:26.390> time<00:04:26.750> to

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
ears ears the deal it takes time to

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.010 
ears ears the deal it takes time to
learn<00:04:27.980> that<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.060> can<00:04:29.270> just<00:04:29.480> throw<00:04:29.630> in<00:04:29.870> a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
learn that you can just throw in a

handful of knots and make it thicker it

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.020 
handful of knots and make it thicker it
takes<00:04:32.930> time<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.530> learn<00:04:33.710> what<00:04:34.070> works<00:04:34.340> when

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
takes time to learn what works when

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.820 
takes time to learn what works when
you're<00:04:35.180> first<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.780> if<00:04:35.930> you're<00:04:36.080> not<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.290> person

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
you're first and if you're not a person

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.560 
you're first and if you're not a person
who<00:04:36.860> cooked<00:04:37.220> from<00:04:37.430> scratch<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:38.090> begin<00:04:38.390> with

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
who cooked from scratch to begin with

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.110 
who cooked from scratch to begin with
then<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.500> are<00:04:39.680> more<00:04:39.890> limited<00:04:40.130> if<00:04:40.580> you're<00:04:41.060> a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
then you are more limited if you're a

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.060 
then you are more limited if you're a
person<00:04:41.330> who<00:04:41.630> is<00:04:41.780> always<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.050> pretty<00:04:42.350> quick

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
person who is always a pretty quick

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.520 
person who is always a pretty quick
then<00:04:43.580> going<00:04:44.030> raw<00:04:44.240> is<00:04:44.540> more<00:04:44.840> difficult<00:04:44.990> and

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
then going raw is more difficult and

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.690 
then going raw is more difficult and
you're<00:04:45.710> going<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.160> have<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.280> really

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
you're going to have to have a really

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.790 
you're going to have to have a really
strong<00:04:46.730> reason<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.480> do<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.750> either<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.470> want

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
strong reason to do it either you want

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.770 
strong reason to do it either you want
to<00:04:48.890> drop<00:04:49.220> off<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.490> bunch<00:04:49.730> of<00:04:49.940> weight<00:04:50.120> or<00:04:50.570> you

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
to drop off a bunch of weight or you

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.050 
to drop off a bunch of weight or you
want<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.050> change<00:04:51.320> your<00:04:51.500> health<00:04:51.770> or<00:04:52.060> you're

want to change your health or you're

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.970 
want to change your health or you're
just<00:04:53.090> feeling<00:04:53.540> lousy<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.530> really<00:04:54.830> need

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
just feeling lousy and you really need

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.010 
just feeling lousy and you really need
to<00:04:55.040> do<00:04:55.250> something<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.970> yourself<00:04:56.030> but<00:04:56.750> other

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
to do something for yourself but other

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.940 
to do something for yourself but other
than<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.910> were<00:04:59.210> not<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.950> cook

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
than that I think if you were not a cook

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.550 
than that I think if you were not a cook
to<00:05:00.980> begin<00:05:01.460> with<00:05:01.750> cooking<00:05:02.750> from<00:05:02.870> scratch<00:05:02.930> is

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
to begin with cooking from scratch is

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.020 
to begin with cooking from scratch is
not<00:05:03.710> going<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:03.950> be<00:05:04.070> your<00:05:04.190> favorite<00:05:04.430> thing<00:05:04.790> it's
