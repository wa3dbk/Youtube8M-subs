00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.279
 hello I am diana garcía of education of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:11.000
 dotcom dogs in this video I'm going to 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.620
 reveal how to teach your puppy to 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.930
 do your needs 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.360
 the first inconvenience that presents itself 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 when bringing a hunting puppy is when 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.360
 start to do your needs 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.080
 physiological in inadequate places the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.790
 reality is that these places are 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.120
 unsuitable for the owner but not for 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.940
 the dog 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.490
 whenever a puppy manifests this 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.740
 behavior is because it has not 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.530
 authorized an appropriate method to 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.690
 teach him properly what is the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 appropriate place to eliminate your 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.330
 depositions 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.300
 from two months the puppies 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.340
 they are already learning what is their bathroom or 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 at least they understand that they should not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.830
 realize their needs where 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.260
 sleep or eat but where 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.199
 forget that the hatcheries 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.160
 puppies live in a canine where they eat 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.060
 they sleep and they do their needs all in 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.180
 the same place and this complicates 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.790
 later learning 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.580
 another frequent cause of this 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.400
 problem is that the puppies feel 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.430
 afraid to go out on the street and that's why 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.040
 they fulfill their needs when they are 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.250
 Take a walk because never 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.460
 They left their warm cage so 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.820
 Now everything is new and stressful for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.820
 they 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.509
 For this reason, it is very important 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.899
 puppy socialization this is a 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.869
 period that goes from the 7 weeks until 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.479
 the 4 months of life time during the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.149
 which they have to learn to relate 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.759
 with humans with other dogs 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.490
 with animals of other species already 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.340
 visit different common environments of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.829
 the city to get used to noise and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.399
 normal situations of life in 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.160
 society the puppies have a rate 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.190
 of fast and efficient learning and 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.099
 they can understand what they are taught 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.610
 it is necessary to instill a sense of 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.470
 rhythm and timing from the same 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.470
 time to bring it to your house 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.599
 the food has to be supplied to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.299
 the same time of each day and carry 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.940
 out other activities in certain 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.690
 fixed hours you must feed him 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.180
 every day at the same time of this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.180
 way will develop habits of 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.340
 very regular removal and you will be able 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.250
 easily foresee when your puppy 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 is about to defecate or pee 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.650
 you should take the puppy out for walks 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.710
 outdoors at the beginning so 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.990
 often as you can but it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.630
 you must pay special attention to take it 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.840
 to the place chosen for them to make their 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.150
 needs immediately after eating 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.020
 who gets up from sleeping and then from 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 play these are the three most 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.370
 important where you have to be very 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.739
 attentive 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.280
 you should always use in the same area 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.950
 so that the odors accumulate and this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.959
 increase the chances that the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.500
 Puppy again perform his 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.290
 needs there

 any area of ​​the house where the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.860
 dirty puppy should be cleaned 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.210
 perfectly and then apply a 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.960
 odor neutralizer or a repellent
