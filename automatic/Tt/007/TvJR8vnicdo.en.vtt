00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
have to look at a pickup not just the M

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.660 
have to look at a pickup not just the M
because<00:01:31.590> pickups<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.370> first

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
because pickups is one of the first

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.110 
because pickups is one of the first
thing<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.330> know<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:34.470> impart<00:01:34.920> the

chain<00:01:36.120> of<00:01:36.390> signal<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.320> sound<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.159> have

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
chain of signal in the sound so we have

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.700 
chain of signal in the sound so we have
a<00:01:38.460> high-output

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
a high-output

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.990

think the warm up isn't just about the

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.050 
think the warm up isn't just about the
hands<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.079> fingers<00:03:12.439> the<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:13.310> know<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:13.939> not

really playing something you know that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.520 
really playing something you know that
you<00:04:01.579> would<00:04:01.760> play<00:04:01.940> on<00:04:02.060> stage<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.569> you're

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
you would play on stage and you're

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.309 
you would play on stage and you're
working<00:04:04.069> your<00:04:04.250> brain<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:05.030> hear<00:04:05.209> chords<00:04:05.780> when

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
working your brain to hear chords when

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.599 
working your brain to hear chords when
you're<00:04:06.440> here<00:04:06.560> called<00:04:06.829> your<00:04:06.980> hand<00:04:07.190> move<00:04:07.370> that

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
you're here called your hand move that

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.939 
you're here called your hand move that
way<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.849> play<00:04:08.419> that<00:04:08.599> notes<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.650> mental

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
way you play that notes so the mental

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.199 
way you play that notes so the mental
exercise<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.519> think<00:04:10.760> that's<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.060> most

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
exercise I think that's the most

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.750 
exercise I think that's the most
important<00:04:11.690> thing<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.769> don't<00:04:13.250> really<00:04:13.310> do<00:04:13.579> any

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
important thing so I don't really do any

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.520 
important thing so I don't really do any
kind<00:04:13.970> of<00:04:14.030> specific<00:04:14.239> scales<00:04:14.780> exercise<00:04:15.260> you

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
kind of specific scales exercise you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.379 
kind of specific scales exercise you
know<00:04:15.620> some<00:04:16.010> some<00:04:16.430> some<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:16.880> those<00:04:16.940> things<00:04:17.180> work

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
know some some some of those things work

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.509

for<00:04:17.539> those<00:04:17.690> different<00:04:18.680> players<00:04:18.889> that<00:04:19.070> you

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
for those different players that you

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.860
