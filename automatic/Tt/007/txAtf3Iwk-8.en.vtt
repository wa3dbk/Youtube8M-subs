00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
which was the screen you I was very

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.539 
which was the screen you I was very
different<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.320> totally<00:01:46.829> possible<00:01:46.979> with

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
different which is totally possible with

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700

now<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> first<00:01:48.420> person<00:01:48.960> modification<00:01:49.560> like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
now the first person modification like

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.050 
now the first person modification like
that<00:01:49.890> would<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> something<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.759> really

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that would be something that is really

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
at the moment you can

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
at the moment you can
actually<00:02:14.250> modify<00:02:14.700> models<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.019> paint

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
actually modify models you can paint

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.860 
actually modify models you can paint
them<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.769> can<00:02:16.920> change<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.549> look<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.540> them

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
them and you can change the look of them

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.059 
them and you can change the look of them
but<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.170> can't<00:02:19.200> actually<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:19.860> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
but you can't actually change the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.149 
but you can't actually change the
physical<00:02:21.260> model<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.769> makes<00:02:22.829> sense

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
physical model of it if that makes sense

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.280 
physical model of it if that makes sense
so<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.360> something<00:02:24.480> coming<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.140> near

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
so that is something coming in the near

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.920 
so that is something coming in the near
future<00:02:25.349> I<00:02:25.920> hope<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.510> something<00:02:27.780> we'll
