00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
advice if I look at the stats real quick

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.279 
advice if I look at the stats real quick
you<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> average<00:00:18.960> 2.4<00:00:19.920> giveaways<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.289> 1.46

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you see I average 2.4 giveaways and 1.46

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
you see I average 2.4 giveaways and 1.46
of<00:00:22.439> those<00:00:22.560> giveaways<00:00:23.010> our<00:00:23.570> farm<00:00:24.570> interception

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of those giveaways our farm interception

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.839 
of those giveaways our farm interception
so<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> means<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> other<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:26.099> point<00:00:26.340> 6<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849

more games than me surprisingly i played
a<00:02:09.090> ton<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.869> um<00:02:10.129> he's<00:02:11.129> averaged<00:02:11.670> point

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
a ton but um he's averaged point

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
a ton but um he's averaged point

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
averaged like the same out of gateways

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.310 
averaged like the same out of gateways
per<00:02:16.060> game<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:16.420> look<00:02:16.510> at<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> interception

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
per game but look at the interception

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.080 
per game but look at the interception
difference<00:02:17.830> most<00:02:18.460> of<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.610> phase<00:02:18.790> are<00:02:18.940> from

difference most of the phase are from

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.150 
difference most of the phase are from

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.010 
interceptions 1.82 only 1.7 1.47 of mine
are<00:02:24.190> from<00:02:24.490> interceptions<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
are from interceptions and if you do the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.170 
are from interceptions and if you do the
math<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.830> means<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.370> i'm<00:02:27.490> averaging<00:02:27.940> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
math that means that i'm averaging like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.960 
math that means that i'm averaging like
point<00:02:29.020> seven<00:02:29.530> five<00:02:29.560> fumbles<00:02:30.130> per<00:02:30.520> game<00:02:30.730> I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
point seven five fumbles per game I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
point seven five fumbles per game I
think<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.480> yeah<00:02:31.840> point<00:02:32.320> seven<00:02:32.590> five

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
think it is yeah point seven five

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.680 
think it is yeah point seven five
fumbles<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.130> game<00:02:33.340> which<00:02:33.820> means<00:02:34.060> i<00:02:34.180> fumble

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
fumbles for game which means i fumble

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.320 
fumbles for game which means i fumble
three<00:02:35.260> out<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.560> every<00:02:35.830> four<00:02:36.160> games<00:02:36.880> I'm
