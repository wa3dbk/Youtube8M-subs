 well let's talk precisely 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 a new release a fragrance 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.220
 for you there is nothing new then it is something that will not happen overnight to the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 tomorrow we could talk about the development process 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.400
 I a dad 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 well I always more or less compare it as 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.130
 it's not a movie 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.929
 first have an idea 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.820
 and of sedapal being common 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.940
 1 a woman bikinis script 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.380
 because he likes to be as good as his concerns 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 who reads a little 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.710
 a fairly extensive script 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.830
 The decision of Saleh is following the idea and we started to work 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.160
 in the jar 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.010
 in the pac in kindergarten from outside in 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.040
 in the campaign 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.830
 and meanwhile of principle in the smell 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.940
 kerr gone the most important thing of a perfume 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 despite the fact that perfume is one of the most important things 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.120
 for a woman 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 I'm saying that in the invisible accessory 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.050
 and what gives you the personality gives you a style 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.150
 and identify with perfume because everything I do is active the most important 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.840
 in one thing that you do not forget 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.120
 and I think that a perfume are very connected so fashion 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.799
 of fashion live in constant 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.840
 it evolved as 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.850
 how to maintain dn this turn 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 transform it into something that is cutting-edge always 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.820
 the head of series 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.390
 lives in constant evolution 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.700
 Fashion changes 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.490
 changes every three months and that's 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.830
 the most amazing thing I do 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.500
 why does not it last 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.360
 you know it does not last is a thing that is changing and that gives you 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 an idea of ​​what should be changing 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 Y 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.569
 the same thing that is happening for example in love 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 fashion is a kind of mystery that nobody knows 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.289
 but it is magical and it is necessary 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.229
 because every day you dress 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.499
 so fashion is with you every day of your life 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.389
