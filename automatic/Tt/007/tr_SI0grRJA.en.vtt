00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
features like geo tagging etc and the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.240 
features like geo tagging etc and the
battery<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.530> better<00:03:10.709> than<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
battery is actually better than the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.300 
battery is actually better than the
other<00:03:11.790> two<00:03:11.910> models<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:13.349> get<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> five<00:03:13.830> hour<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
other two models you get a five hour of

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.610 
other two models you get a five hour of
talk<00:03:14.519> time<00:03:14.760> along<00:03:15.299> with<00:03:15.330> 180<00:03:15.930> hours<00:03:16.230> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
talk time along with 180 hours of

talk time along with 180 hours of
standby<00:03:17.400> time<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.870> these<00:03:19.440> are<00:03:19.829> some<00:03:20.989> main<00:03:21.989> main
