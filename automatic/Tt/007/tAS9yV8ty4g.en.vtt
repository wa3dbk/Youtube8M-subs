00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
lost in the moves so I used to have like

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.230 
lost in the moves so I used to have like
a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> series<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.460> stuff<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
a lot of series and stuff but this is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.060 
a lot of series and stuff but this is
kind<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.140> i<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.710> found
