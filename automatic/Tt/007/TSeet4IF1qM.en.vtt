00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the first thing to do is 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.130
 logically buy the sticker on the site 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 from the audience 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.469
 the link is in the description of this video does not 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.269
 forget the stickers it was now just 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.110
 wait up to five business days after 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.360
 send 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 before applying the adhesive is Contag 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 important to know that it goes in three 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 parts 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 line is the paper with a smooth face and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.400
 where the adhesive is glued to a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.920
 sticker itself and the magic 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.130
 is used to transfer the chip adhesive 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.989
 in hands we will apply it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.020
 so I'm going to position here more or less 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 Where do I want to be first thing? 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 do is pull one corner points of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.140
 mask 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.410
 You're going to pull it like it's a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 triangle will fold online making a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 link in it you can see better 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 this image and placing it aligned in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180
 local 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 you will apply this first part of the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.539
 brand 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.140
 then you're pulling next line 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 is underneath and rubbing his finger 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.210
 on the mask so that you apply the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.150
 sticker with the magic you've been pulling 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 online scrubbing from the center to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.990
 never went from end to end 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.570
 here for example the floor from the center to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.750
 up from the center down and go pulling 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
 online until you can apply the sticker 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 all with magic 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.400
 I will not play online forum I will not get 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 part marlisa of him rubbing a sticker 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.159
 with the mask firm enough it and 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.369
 now last I'm going to pull the tip of the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.670
 mask so that only the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.799
 sticker is important to see how I am 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.689
 pulling it in this way so that the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.689
 bumper sticker do not come along with the magic
