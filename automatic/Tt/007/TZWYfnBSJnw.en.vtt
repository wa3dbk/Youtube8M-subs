irons which i'll show you guys in a
minute<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.580> instead<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> getting<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> gap<00:01:21.900> wedge

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
minute I instead of getting a gap wedge

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
minute I instead of getting a gap wedge
with<00:01:23.600> because<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:25.020> old<00:01:25.290> set<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> burner<00:01:25.860> two

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
with because my old set the burner two

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.600 
with because my old set the burner two
coils<00:01:26.520> work<00:01:27.420> Abby<00:01:27.750> backs<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:29.130> came<00:01:29.400> with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
coils work Abby backs and it came with

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050 
coils work Abby backs and it came with
it<00:01:29.939> went<00:01:30.180> 9<00:01:30.390> pitching<00:01:31.200> wedge<00:01:31.820> approach<00:01:32.820> wedge

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it went 9 pitching wedge approach wedge

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
it went 9 pitching wedge approach wedge
or<00:01:33.270> attack<00:01:33.570> wedge<00:01:33.869> AG<00:01:34.530> whatever<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> prefer

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
or attack wedge AG whatever you prefer

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.300 
or attack wedge AG whatever you prefer
her<00:01:36.030> aww<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:41.270> roughly<00:01:42.270> 50

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
her aww and so that was about roughly 50

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.429 
her aww and so that was about roughly 50
50<00:01:44.310> degrees<00:01:44.670> maybe<00:01:45.630> 52<00:01:47.630> but<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
50 degrees maybe 52 but I come with the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.039 
50 degrees maybe 52 but I come with the
CG<00:01:49.890> 10<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.909> some<00:01:51.119> reason<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:51.750> it's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
CG 10 that for some reason the way it's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.590 
CG 10 that for some reason the way it's
either<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.560> weight<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.509> something<00:01:54.509> that's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
either the weight or something that's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.730 
either the weight or something that's
different<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
different in it that I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
different in it that I
is<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> 52<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.400> still<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:56.970> as<00:01:57.270> far<00:01:57.509> as

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
is the 52 and still go just as far as

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.280 
is the 52 and still go just as far as
the<00:01:58.229> 50<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.970> yeah<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.689> bag<00:02:00.869> also

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the 50 so yeah I put that in my bag also

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.730 
the 50 so yeah I put that in my bag also
got<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> same<00:02:01.710> grip<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.630> least<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.140> also

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
got the same grip on it as least it also

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.900 
got the same grip on it as least it also
it's<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.340> half<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:06.030> inch<00:02:06.149> longer<00:02:06.479> than<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:07.789> 56<00:02:08.789> my

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's a half an inch longer than my 56 my

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
it's a half an inch longer than my 56 my
60<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.259> gap<00:02:10.500> between<00:02:10.679> my

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
60 make up for that a gap between my

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.080 
60 make up for that a gap between my
pitching<00:02:11.370> wedge<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.150> 120<00:02:13.050> mi<00:02:14.090> 56

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
pitching wedge which is about 120 mi 56

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
pitching wedge which is about 120 mi 56
which<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.420> only<00:02:15.599> about<00:02:15.720> 85<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
which is only about 85 so there's like a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.059 
which is only about 85 so there's like a
really<00:02:17.340> big<00:02:17.700> gap<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.110> yeah<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> had<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
really big gap in there so yeah I had to

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.080 
really big gap in there so yeah I had to
fill<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.599> 50<00:02:21.599> was<00:02:21.780> too<00:02:22.380> long<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:23.849> I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
fill that I 50 was too long so then I

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
iron is really hard to hit but

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
iron is really hard to hit but
definitely<00:03:21.959> gets<00:03:22.140> me<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> lot<00:03:22.530> of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
definitely gets me out a lot of

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.860 
definitely gets me out a lot of
situations<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.549> especially<00:03:24.269> since<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.750> hit

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
situations and especially since I hit

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
situations and especially since I hit
hybrids<00:03:25.290> really<00:03:25.769> really<00:03:26.040> high<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.549> had<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.390> tone

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
hybrids really really high I had to tone

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.720 
hybrids really really high I had to tone
it<00:03:27.569> down<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.930> literally<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> 3-wood<00:03:28.829> hybrid<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
it down at literally a 3-wood hybrid to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.150 
it down at literally a 3-wood hybrid to
get<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.359> go<00:03:30.480> home<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> trajectory<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.829> want

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
get to go home like a trajectory I want

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.099 
get to go home like a trajectory I want
but<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:32.819> doesn't<00:03:33.180> does<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.989> distance

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
but then doesn't does it go the distance

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.930 
but then doesn't does it go the distance
of<00:03:34.410> three<00:03:34.680> wood<00:03:34.829> because<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.579> doesn't<00:03:35.910> have

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
of three wood because it doesn't have

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.129 
of three wood because it doesn't have
the<00:03:36.090> big<00:03:36.540> faces<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> 3-wood<00:03:38.730> does<00:03:39.139> now

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
the big faces as like a 3-wood does now

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.150

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I've got the Titleist 9-10 f3 was still

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.559 
I've got the Titleist 9-10 f3 was still

dry

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
dry

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.880 
dry
three<00:04:00.790> wood<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.690> me<00:04:01.930> are<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.200> little<00:04:02.380> bit<00:04:02.590> much

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
three wood for me are a little bit much

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.680 
three wood for me are a little bit much
but<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.250> sacrifice<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> little<00:04:04.030> bit<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.390> distance

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
but I sacrifice a little bit of distance

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.140 
but I sacrifice a little bit of distance
for<00:04:05.170> more<00:04:05.560> accuracy<00:04:06.010> because<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.700> shaft<00:04:06.970> is

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
for more accuracy because the shaft is

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.680 
for more accuracy because the shaft is
more<00:04:07.360> stiff<00:04:08.280> right<00:04:09.280> now<00:04:09.430> I've<00:04:09.760> got<00:04:09.790> an<00:04:10.210> 82
