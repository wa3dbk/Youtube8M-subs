additional four cards and thus have a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.710 
additional four cards and thus have a
better<00:01:17.640> chance<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.240> spelling<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> larger<00:01:19.200> word

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
better chance of spelling a larger word

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.230 
better chance of spelling a larger word
you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.970> spell<00:01:24.380> oil

ride but prior to that there was red

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.480 
ride but prior to that there was red
so<00:04:50.670> those<00:04:51.030> letters<00:04:51.540> would<00:04:51.960> come<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.070> me<00:04:53.220> and

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490

so those letters would come to me and
the<00:04:54.030> dealer<00:04:54.240> would<00:04:54.450> send<00:04:54.840> out<00:04:55.340> more<00:04:56.340> letters

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130
