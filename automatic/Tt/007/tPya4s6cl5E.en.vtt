self-replicating serving or self
generating<00:00:52.739> chickens<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.820> start

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
generating chickens when I really start

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
generating chickens when I really start
generating<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.960> basically<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.440> happens<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
generating so basically what happens is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.810 
generating so basically what happens is
I've<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.870> load<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> chickens<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
I've got a load of chickens here and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.500 
I've got a load of chickens here and
then<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:01.489> water<00:01:02.489> fountain<00:01:02.850> coming<00:01:03.180> down

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
then I have a water fountain coming down

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
then I have a water fountain coming down
and<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> eggs<00:01:04.260> running<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and all of the eggs running down this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
and all of the eggs running down this
way<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.850> hopper<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
way into the top hopper here which you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.660 
way into the top hopper here which you
just<00:01:06.960> saw<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.799> hopper<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.280> leads<00:01:08.490> into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just saw this hopper then leads into

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.020 
just saw this hopper then leads into
this<00:01:08.939> chest<00:01:09.860> into<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.979> hopper<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
this chest into this hopper into this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
this chest into this hopper into this
chest<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.260> basically<00:01:13.470> filters<00:01:14.159> all

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
chest so it just basically filters all

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.050 
chest so it just basically filters all
the<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:16.130> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.729> bottom

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the way down right to the bottom

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.969 
the way down right to the bottom
so<00:01:18.509> you'll<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.869> here's<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> last<00:01:20.130> bunch<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
so you'll see here's the last bunch of

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.760 
so you'll see here's the last bunch of
blow<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> chest<00:01:24.259> here's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> hopper<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
blow out of the chest here's a hopper so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
blow out of the chest here's a hopper so
that<00:01:25.920> chest<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> full<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.060> happens<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that chest is full so what happens is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.760 
that chest is full so what happens is
when<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.680> these<00:01:28.740> chests<00:01:29.159> falls<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:30.770> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
when one of these chests falls up it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
when one of these chests falls up it
basically<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.790> starts<00:01:33.390> filling<00:01:33.570> out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
basically then just starts filling out

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.109 
basically then just starts filling out
the<00:01:33.810> chest<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> top<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.040> after<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> while

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the chest at the top so after a while

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
the chest at the top so after a while
every<00:01:36.810> single<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> these<00:01:37.350> chests<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
every single one of these chests and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.840 
every single one of these chests and
hoppers<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.640> full<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
hoppers will be full so if I just go to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
hoppers will be full so if I just go to
the<00:01:41.850> actual<00:01:42.570> main<00:01:42.750> chest<00:01:43.110> you'll<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.680> here's

yeah<00:02:17.070> well<00:02:17.820> then<00:02:17.940> suck<00:02:18.180> these<00:02:18.390> eggs<00:02:18.660> into<00:02:19.050> this

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
yeah well then suck these eggs into this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.250 
yeah well then suck these eggs into this
dispenser<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.670> then<00:02:20.880> immediately

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
dispenser which then immediately

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.850 
dispenser which then immediately
dispenses<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:23.090> okay<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.590> every<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> again

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
dispenses it okay so every now and again

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280 
dispenses it okay so every now and again
I<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.310> need<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.580> top<00:02:27.330> up<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.690> top<00:02:27.960> chest

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I just need to top up this top chest

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.380 
I just need to top up this top chest
with<00:02:28.920> eggs<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.460> it'll<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.820> automatically

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
with eggs and it'll just automatically

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.150 
with eggs and it'll just automatically
just<00:02:30.600> shoot<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.020> generate<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:31.740> new<00:02:31.920> baby

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
just shoot and generate little new baby

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.600 
just shoot and generate little new baby
baby<00:02:33.000> chickens<00:02:33.480> who<00:02:33.660> will<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.460> well<00:02:35.460> then

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
baby chickens who will then well then

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.730 
baby chickens who will then well then
lay<00:02:35.850> eventually<00:02:36.630> grow<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.110> lay<00:02:37.200> eggs<00:02:37.470> like

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
lay eventually grow up and lay eggs like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
lay eventually grow up and lay eggs like
so<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> you'll<00:02:39.210> see<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.510> hopper<00:02:40.670> pumping<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so so you'll see this hopper pumping it

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.700 
so so you'll see this hopper pumping it
into<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.870> reasons<00:02:43.230> flashing<00:02:43.620> is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
into here so the reasons flashing is

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.290 
into here so the reasons flashing is
because<00:02:43.950> goes<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.850> immediately<00:02:45.180> gets

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
because goes in and immediately gets

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
because goes in and immediately gets
sucked<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.720> by<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.050> hopper<00:02:46.800> over<00:02:47.070> here

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
sucked out by this hopper over here

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520 
sucked out by this hopper over here
which<00:02:48.090> gets<00:02:48.240> input<00:02:48.600> into<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.960> chest<00:02:49.260> which

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
which gets input into that chest which

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.500 
which gets input into that chest which
then<00:02:49.680> gets<00:02:49.890> sucked<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.490> by<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.790> hopper<00:02:51.180> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
then gets sucked in by that hopper and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.470 
then gets sucked in by that hopper and
then<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:51.930> filters<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.740> way<00:02:52.860> down<00:02:53.480> so

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
then just filters all the way down so

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.050 
then just filters all the way down so
this<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.990> very<00:02:55.230> very<00:02:55.590> quick<00:02:55.890> very<00:02:56.700> cool

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
this is just a very very quick very cool

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
this is just a very very quick very cool
idea<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.410> actually<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.980> with

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
idea of what you can actually do with

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.350 
idea of what you can actually do with
these<00:03:00.140> these<00:03:01.140> hoppers<00:03:01.500> now<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.880> hopper<00:03:03.180> can

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
these these hoppers now the hopper can

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.710 
these these hoppers now the hopper can
actually<00:03:04.010> played<00:03:05.010> with<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.310> for<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> bit<00:03:05.880> now<00:03:06.180> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
actually played with it for a bit now it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
actually played with it for a bit now it
can<00:03:06.960> actually<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.260> different

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
can actually have a very different

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.350 
can actually have a very different
direction<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.370> actually<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.850> into<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
direction of actually going into the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.400 
direction of actually going into the
chest<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:12.720> you'll<00:03:12.840> see<00:03:12.960> this<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.260> goes

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
chest so you'll see this one goes

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.640 
chest so you'll see this one goes
straight<00:03:13.620> down<00:03:14.600> but<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.110> can't<00:03:16.440> actually

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
straight down but if you can't actually

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.190 
straight down but if you can't actually
have<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.100> sideways<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:18.030> well<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.390> let<00:03:18.540> me<00:03:18.630> first

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
have it sideways as well so let me first

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.810 
have it sideways as well so let me first
of<00:03:19.380> all<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.830> just<00:03:19.980> need<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.160> put<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> block<00:03:20.610> that

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
of all we just need to put a block that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.990 
of all we just need to put a block that
is<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:25.140> doesn't<00:03:25.800> if<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.640> click<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:26.910> it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
is not that doesn't if you click on it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.730 
is not that doesn't if you click on it
right<00:03:27.090> click<00:03:27.420> on<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> doesn't<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:27.930> anything<00:03:28.140> so

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
right click on it doesn't do anything so

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.290 
right click on it doesn't do anything so
if<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.459> click<00:03:29.490> on<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.060> particular

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
if I now right click on this particular

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.230 
if I now right click on this particular
block<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:31.050> will<00:03:31.140> see<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:32.060> there<00:03:33.060> little

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
block you will see that there little

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.230 
block you will see that there little
little<00:03:34.050> spout<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> bottom<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> should

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
little spout at the bottom now I should

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.430 
little spout at the bottom now I should
go<00:03:36.360> sideways<00:03:36.800> so<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:37.830> can<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.370> have<00:03:39.440> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
go sideways so you can actually have so

these so you can actually have these

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.690 
these so you can actually have these
hoppers<00:03:47.090> surrounding<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.150> chest<00:03:48.420> like<00:03:48.600> so

right and then just pop the chest in the
middle<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:53.100> any<00:03:53.280> hopper<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.850> any<00:03:54.030> side

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
middle and then any hopper on any side

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.449 
middle and then any hopper on any side
will<00:03:55.050> then<00:03:55.230> kind<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.530> doing<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.280> can
