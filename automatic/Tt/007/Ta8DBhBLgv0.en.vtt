00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
but that's really just so it won't take

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
but that's really just so it won't take
as<00:00:20.220> long<00:00:20.369> let<00:00:20.850> me<00:00:20.970> show<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.359> I'm<00:00:21.449> doing

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
so one of the things that you can do is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.570 
so one of the things that you can do is
watch<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.350> video<00:00:25.560> i<00:00:25.619> did<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> bank<00:00:26.220> braid

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
watch the video i did on the bank braid

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
watch the video i did on the bank braid
and<00:00:27.029> i<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.420> link<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:27.960> down<00:00:28.529> here

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and i will link to it right down here

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
and i will link to it right down here
because<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.300> kind<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> give<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
because that will kind of give you a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.330 
because that will kind of give you a
good<00:00:30.960> idea<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.410> i<00:00:31.439> mean<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:31.710> i<00:00:31.859> say<00:00:32.099> pull

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
good idea of what i mean when i say pull

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.370 
good idea of what i mean when i say pull
from<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> front<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.390> twist<00:00:33.870> uses

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
from the front because this twist uses

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.580 
from the front because this twist uses
the<00:00:34.500> same<00:00:34.680> principle<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:36.420> makes<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.989> bang

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the same principle that makes the bang

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.840 
the same principle that makes the bang
Bray<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> showed<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.460> how<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> do

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
Bray that I showed you all how to do

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
here from the front so you're going to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.139 
here from the front so you're going to
start<00:00:42.950> by<00:00:43.950> taking<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> chunk<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to divide it like this normally but i

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
to divide it like this normally but i
just<00:00:49.289> said<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.250> ease<00:00:50.550> um

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
just said it for a little bit of ease um

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
this much hair from the top and divide

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.800 
this much hair from the top and divide
it<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:11.600> you're<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> take

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.390 
front so that the back is now the front
and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> front<00:01:22.400> you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
