that<00:01:06.960> they're<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> end<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> an<00:01:07.799> error<00:01:08.040> where

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that they're the end of an error where

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
that they're the end of an error where
they<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> lot<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.170> color

they really put a lot of you know color

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.969 
they really put a lot of you know color
and<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.549> detail<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.500> weren't<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.710> much

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and time in detail and weren't so much

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
and time in detail and weren't so much
worried<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.670> cost<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.390> today

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
little bit lower as you can see but then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
little bit lower as you can see but then
there's<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.240> try<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.840> them

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
there's you know try to get them

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.010 
there's you know try to get them
balanced<00:01:31.320> correctly<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.630> one

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
balanced correctly and I think this one

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
balanced correctly and I think this one
leg<00:01:34.229> over<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:35.189> loose<00:01:35.400> but

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
leg over here is a little bit loose but

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
leg over here is a little bit loose but
kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> idea<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.409> mine<00:01:37.619> works<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
kind of get the idea so mine works a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
kind of get the idea so mine works a
little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.369> better<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.970> him<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.869> know

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
little bit better if I have him you know

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.289 
little bit better if I have him you know
extended<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.700> far<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> size

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
extended like so but as far as a size

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.410 
extended like so but as far as a size
comparison<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.890> comparison<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:45.060> is

we're going to do is grab this tail
section<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:47.849> of<00:02:47.879> split<00:02:48.239> that

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
section and just kind of split that

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.949 
section and just kind of split that
leave<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> side<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> this

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
leave that out to the side then this

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.780 
leave that out to the side then this
section<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.470> tabbed<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.670> also

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
section is tabbed in there it's also

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.830 
section is tabbed in there it's also
tabbed<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.450> there

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
tabbed in there

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.899

so we'll just kind of lift up on that

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.809 
so we'll just kind of lift up on that
and<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.329> see<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.659> it<00:02:57.780> came<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.349> easy<00:02:58.819> and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
far as the g1 either real quick it won't

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:24.450 
far as the g1 either real quick it won't
take<00:05:11.600> long

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.180 
all right setting these two side-by-side
you<00:05:28.010> can<00:05:28.700> definitely<00:05:29.800> see<00:05:30.800> what<00:05:30.980> they<00:05:31.130> were

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
you can definitely see what they were

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.860 
you can definitely see what they were
kind<00:05:31.490> of<00:05:31.520> going<00:05:31.850> with<00:05:32.000> just<00:05:32.210> trying<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.570> get<00:05:32.690> a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
kind of going with just trying to get a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.010 
kind of going with just trying to get a
little<00:05:33.110> bit<00:05:33.320> of<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.500> g1<00:05:33.890> nod<00:05:34.160> but<00:05:34.520> still

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
little bit of the g1 nod but still

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.860 
little bit of the g1 nod but still
staying<00:05:36.020> true<00:05:36.260> to<00:05:36.380> itself<00:05:37.300> with<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.660> know<00:05:38.750> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
staying true to itself with you know the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.210 
staying true to itself with you know the
chest<00:05:39.170> like<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.410> said<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.650> gold<00:05:39.830> here<00:05:40.040> then

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
chest like I said the gold here then

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.770 
chest like I said the gold here then
they<00:05:40.310> have<00:05:40.460> this<00:05:40.640> clear<00:05:41.030> piece<00:05:41.330> right<00:05:41.540> here

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
they have this clear piece right here

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.190 
they have this clear piece right here
which<00:05:41.990> is<00:05:42.020> really<00:05:42.320> cool<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:42.710> red<00:05:42.920> here<00:05:43.280> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
which is really cool the red here and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.080 
which is really cool the red here and
you<00:05:45.200> know<00:05:45.290> would<00:05:45.500> be<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.890> legs<00:05:46.160> coming<00:05:46.910> down

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
you know would be the legs coming down

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.170 
you know would be the legs coming down
here<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.450> the<00:05:47.540> side<00:05:47.800> or<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.920> tail<00:05:49.160> tell<00:05:49.940> over

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
here to the side or the tail tell over

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.570 
here to the side or the tail tell over
here<00:05:50.390> as<00:05:50.480> well<00:05:50.690> so<00:05:50.930> very<00:05:50.960> cool<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.800> lot<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.370> nice

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
here as well so very cool a lot of nice

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.660 
here as well so very cool a lot of nice
not<00:05:53.380> going<00:05:54.380> on<00:05:54.470> there<00:05:54.650> as<00:05:55.250> far<00:05:55.490> as<00:05:55.580> the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
not going on there as far as the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.060 
not going on there as far as the
articulation<00:05:56.420> his<00:05:57.140> head<00:05:57.200> does<00:05:57.800> rotate

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
articulation his head does rotate

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.430 
articulation his head does rotate
doesn't<00:05:58.640> go<00:05:58.700> 360<00:05:59.570> but<00:05:59.870> basically<00:06:00.170> wherever

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
doesn't go 360 but basically wherever

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.860 
doesn't go 360 but basically wherever
his<00:06:00.770> jaw<00:06:01.100> kind<00:06:01.280> of<00:06:01.400> hits<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.820> side<00:06:02.030> but<00:06:02.240> you

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
his jaw kind of hits to the side but you

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.050 
his jaw kind of hits to the side but you
wouldn't<00:06:03.200> really<00:06:03.290> need<00:06:03.530> to<00:06:03.710> you<00:06:04.640> know<00:06:04.730> rotate

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
wouldn't really need to you know rotate

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.710 
wouldn't really need to you know rotate
any<00:06:05.390> further<00:06:05.630> than<00:06:05.840> that<00:06:08.770> yeah<00:06:10.480> all<00:06:11.480> right<00:06:11.600> as

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
any further than that yeah all right as

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.870 
any further than that yeah all right as
far<00:06:11.930> as<00:06:11.990> his<00:06:12.440> shoulders<00:06:12.770> you<00:06:12.920> these<00:06:13.160> can<00:06:13.520> go<00:06:13.640> in

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
far as his shoulders you these can go in

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.640 
far as his shoulders you these can go in
and<00:06:14.060> out<00:06:14.180> they<00:06:14.420> kind<00:06:14.570> of<00:06:14.690> go<00:06:14.780> up<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.110> down<00:06:15.320> here

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
and out they kind of go up and down here

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.150 
and out they kind of go up and down here
they<00:06:16.430> can<00:06:16.550> also<00:06:16.700> rotate<00:06:17.030> 100<00:06:17.780> or<00:06:17.930> 360<00:06:18.800> degrees

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
they can also rotate 100 or 360 degrees

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.500 
they can also rotate 100 or 360 degrees
is<00:06:19.430> elbow<00:06:20.240> goes<00:06:21.790> 90<00:06:22.790> degree<00:06:23.060> bend<00:06:23.270> their

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
is elbow goes 90 degree bend their

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.140 
is elbow goes 90 degree bend their
wrists<00:06:24.260> do<00:06:24.440> you<00:06:24.500> rotate<00:06:24.740> his<00:06:25.250> thumb<00:06:25.580> goes<00:06:25.940> in

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
wrists do you rotate his thumb goes in

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.260 
wrists do you rotate his thumb goes in
and<00:06:26.270> out<00:06:26.530> these<00:06:27.530> four<00:06:27.920> this<00:06:28.460> claw<00:06:28.820> here<00:06:29.090> that

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
and out these four this claw here that

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.700 
and out these four this claw here that
goes<00:06:29.750> in<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.080> out<00:06:30.110> as<00:06:30.290> well

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
goes in and out as well

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.550 
goes in and out as well
rotates<00:06:31.430> here<00:06:31.700> at<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:31.910> waist<00:06:32.320> leg<00:06:33.320> goes

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
rotates here at the waist leg goes

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.840 
rotates here at the waist leg goes
forward<00:06:33.590> just<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.070> little<00:06:34.100> bit<00:06:34.310> doesn't<00:06:34.670> go

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
forward just a little bit doesn't go

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.640 
forward just a little bit doesn't go
back<00:06:35.150> too<00:06:35.630> far<00:06:35.660> or<00:06:36.350> there<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:36.950> go

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
back too far or there you go

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.469 
back too far or there you go
you<00:06:37.889> kind<00:06:38.130> of<00:06:38.160> have<00:06:38.280> that<00:06:38.310> like<00:06:38.580> put<00:06:39.360> a<00:06:39.419> little

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
you kind of have that like put a little

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.840 
you kind of have that like put a little
bit<00:06:39.870> of<00:06:39.990> force<00:06:40.229> on<00:06:40.470> it<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:41.280> make<00:06:41.370> it<00:06:41.490> go<00:06:41.550> back

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
bit of force on it to make it go back

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.050 
bit of force on it to make it go back
goes<00:06:42.330> out<00:06:42.600> all<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.169> way<00:06:43.350> does<00:06:43.770> rotate<00:06:44.070> here

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 
goes out all the way does rotate here

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.140 
goes out all the way does rotate here
and<00:06:45.330> he<00:06:45.780> also<00:06:45.990> bends<00:06:46.560> here<00:06:46.860> so<00:06:47.190> quite<00:06:47.880> a<00:06:47.910> bit<00:06:48.060> of

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
and he also bends here so quite a bit of

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.529 
and he also bends here so quite a bit of
articulation<00:06:48.780> as<00:06:49.530> far<00:06:49.800> as<00:06:49.949> his<00:06:50.430> sword<00:06:50.759> you<00:06:51.360> can

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
articulation as far as his sword you can

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.110 
articulation as far as his sword you can
keep<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:51.990> and<00:06:52.440> it<00:06:52.530> just<00:06:52.710> plugs<00:06:52.949> into<00:06:53.220> the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
keep it and it just plugs into the

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.820 
keep it and it just plugs into the
inside<00:06:54.630> of<00:06:54.750> his<00:06:54.870> hand<00:06:55.080> there<00:06:55.229> and<00:06:55.350> you<00:06:55.440> wrap

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
inside of his hand there and you wrap

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.890 
inside of his hand there and you wrap
the<00:06:55.860> claw<00:06:56.100> around<00:06:56.280> it<00:06:56.610> and<00:06:57.330> you<00:06:57.449> can<00:06:57.539> see<00:06:57.660> that

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
the claw around it and you can see that

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.499 
the claw around it and you can see that
it's<00:06:58.139> just<00:06:58.470> one<00:06:59.190> solid<00:06:59.639> piece<00:06:59.669> here<00:07:00.150> but<00:07:00.330> if

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
it's just one solid piece here but if

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.140 
it's just one solid piece here but if
you<00:07:00.630> rotate<00:07:01.080> his<00:07:01.350> hand<00:07:01.620> or<00:07:01.919> his<00:07:01.979> wrist<00:07:02.520> inside

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
you rotate his hand or his wrist inside

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.020 
you rotate his hand or his wrist inside
or<00:07:03.419> out

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
or out

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.969 
or out
then<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:06.570> these<00:07:06.990> little<00:07:07.289> things<00:07:07.500> pop<00:07:07.800> out

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
then it these little things pop out

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.529 
then it these little things pop out
right<00:07:08.130> here<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:08.370> that's<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.240> only<00:07:09.389> way<00:07:09.509> that

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
right here so that's the only way that

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.080 
right here so that's the only way that
you're<00:07:09.780> going<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:09.930> be<00:07:10.050> able<00:07:10.169> to<00:07:10.440> activate<00:07:10.860> that

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
you're going to be able to activate that

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.360 
you're going to be able to activate that
which<00:07:12.090> i<00:07:12.180> think<00:07:12.240> is<00:07:12.449> a<00:07:12.479> cool<00:07:12.840> little<00:07:12.960> gimmick

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
which i think is a cool little gimmick

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.320 
which i think is a cool little gimmick
which<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:14.580> would<00:07:14.699> stay<00:07:14.970> in<00:07:15.060> there<00:07:15.180> a<00:07:15.210> little

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
which that would stay in there a little

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.800 
which that would stay in there a little
bit<00:07:15.539> better<00:07:15.720> but<00:07:15.990> it's<00:07:16.229> all<00:07:16.860> right<00:07:17.570> there<00:07:18.570> is

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
bit better but it's all right there is
