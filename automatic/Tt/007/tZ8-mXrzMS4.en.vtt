00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 I am alive and dark 92 and very good at 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.349
 all vaquitas we are here once you go to 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 be tomorrow and good today I bring the third 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.420
 trap in the snow biome is worth it because 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.650
 it camouflages very well and is a trap that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.689
 you burn only with touching her then 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 see what a beautiful language I am in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.500
 high on the mountain and good the trap 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 I have it in camouflaged between the cloud 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.450
 knows nothing then we will go down and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 well you burn when you step on it that's 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.750
 the curious theme of the trap or you 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 you're walking around here could be by 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.050
 here that when you take it and go 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.390
 walking and you step on that lava and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.239
 you die then it's super effective 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.710
 this would be a trap prototype but 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.140
 well the one that is really active is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 what's up that I do not end up inflated 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 for now then let's camouflage the and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.610
 you are going to see how this would be worth we are going to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.340
 remove the crystal 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.130
 and when we went through these four of 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.430
 mena network these are going to see what 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.510
 would happen we are going to cover 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 around here with a film we are going to see 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.960
 there all this is not going to see anything 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.620
 is completely camouflaged we do like this 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.690
 around here either that you see anything like that and 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.050
 well let's try life to see if 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.050
 you like and good you nothing more 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 Hahaha 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.570
 It is worth, it dies, it is burned, you can not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.450
 stop this unless you throw yourself to a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.300
 lake you will not live for nothing 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 is totally effective then I'm going to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.300
 teaching how to do it is very simple 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 Doing this does not require large 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.720
 knowledge of the rest then we're going to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.790
 cover here I come to an area 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 a little cleaner because the other 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.020
 area were coming out jets of lava and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.759
 It is not flat either to do it with those 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.290
 circumstances is worth saying this has 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.930
 come this area so clean look at the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 snow that white and we're going to start 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.030
 make the trap very simple ok let's go 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.030
 to start by placing the 4 - of restore 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.130
 in the center it is worth and you will say because I 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.890
 explain right now it's worth now let's 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.560
 place three dispensers is worth 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.490
 you have to understand that for each ore of 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.720
 rector is going to activate three 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.850
 dispensers is worth it because then because 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.430
 below is going to go a network torch 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.680
 sun and it will allow you to turn on three 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.440
 here exactly the same thing is going to be 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.230
 three that's why we can complete the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.640
 square here would be the other three and in 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.190
 the other side then exactly the same 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.010
 that's why it's necessary to do it from 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.530
 four in four 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.079
 we do like that and we already have it worth this 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.730
 it would be the first part that in the base 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.680
 well we can remove the torches 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 that are not necessary now let's go to 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.849
 the bottom part to assemble everything is very 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.670
 simple but you have to be attentive 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.900
 ok let's go to the bottom part already 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.760
 clean up a bit since I had it all 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.310
 prepared because remove all this 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.659
 creative sees two minutes 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.930
 unnecessary that you do not want to see 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.280
 good in the area below the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.060
 mean of rest let's place four 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.910
 piston looking down is worth 1 2 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.080
 3 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.330
 to see fuck how I'm my mother 3 but 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.660
 good today that piston what's up with you sir 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.550
 with what yes looking down is worth 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.140
 four pistons 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.390
 now we are going to place four blocks of 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.740
 restore here first the first one here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.170
 four blocks of rest and now we 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.690
 let's go to the top 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.250
 and I activated this without wanting to be worth 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.130
 moment is because they have been activated without 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.130
 want to be deactivated by pressing the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.230
 shift are set off if you do not go 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.880
 to have problems 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.819
 let's place here four blocks of 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.760
 rest four here pressing the yes 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.739
 also and good now comes the theme 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.959
 curious of the trap we are going to place 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.030
 another four new reston blocks 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.060
 here and we're going to remove the one above 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.700
 because in this way we beat the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.340
 piston and when someone steps on the vein of 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.420
 restore this piston will go up towards 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.280
 up is worth 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.680
 let's remove the four one by one 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.660
 quietly is to say when someone 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.280
 step on the look of the rest this block in 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.470
 time to be here will go up 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.169
 what do we want for 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.760
 activate the four corners and already what 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.510
 we have done that is what we have to 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.210
 do now 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.210
 just give it energy up here 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.390
 then we will easily go up 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.390
 here 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.180
 let's place a little droplet attentive 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.939
 of reston always for every corner goes to 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.009
 go this mechanism now going to go here a 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:47.099
 torch and how we want to invest the 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.110
 another process here is valid so that when 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.569
 go up the reston block just pass it 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.819
 opposite and activate the lava let's 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.780
 to do it again here ok we put one 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:01.030
 here 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:04.350
 another one here and another one here not sorry 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.210
 so it would be the same droplet of reston 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.490
 torch and we reverse the process just 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.370
 in the corner you see here exactly what 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.300
 same and as it is, it has no more 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:20.919
 as easy as that if it would be there 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.349
 droplet restore torch and invert 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.990
 and finally, we're going to finish 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.000
 do in this is the same 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.259
 we take here to see moment that I 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.460
 mess 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.610
 we take here 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:39.020
 If we already have it, it was not like that. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.849
 ay ay vale reston torch and 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.470
 again the torch and that's it 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.520
 we have now we are going to come out above 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.759
 because since caught now 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.580
 and that we have the last thing that is 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:54.340
 fill all the scattered boats of 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.950
 lava then let's catch I'll let go 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.120
 around here a lot 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.130
 this is going to go outside out outside 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.630
 out outside out everything no longer needs 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.550
 we need lava cubes 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.850
 let's go putting one 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.380
 one by one the cubes and now the 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.240
 we will prove the trap in his rival to 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.610
 that you understand the power of my traps 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.680
 be careful if you do this already 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.420
 I always say it on servers because I 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.310
 They can vary but we are going great 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.770
 it is also a trap that they are 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.510
 totally camouflaged you do not see anything or 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.840
 it's super epic 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.110
 we go here and well let's take a 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.020
 couple of cubes more and we finished this I 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.900
 I think there are three worth one here in the 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.060
 that there's the opposite another here over here 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.220
 another here and finally in this corner 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.890
 ok if you leave some nothing happens 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.720
 because they 're going to die anyway 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.360
 remove these cubes with the shift was 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.500
 driven and we're going to fill all the 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.950
 holes these so you do not see the 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.060
 trap and we have it here now the 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.060
 I'm going to cover 100% 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.669
 in this way it's worth it we have it and now 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.800
 is already we have the trap and camouflaged 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.820
 totally nothing is seen and now 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.050
 we are simply going to approve it in 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.760
 survival so you can see what it is 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.710
 totally effective are worth carme mode and 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.360
 survival you imagine that someone comes 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.229
 around here he goes to calmly says 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.610
 hahahaha or years or it is ok you die to 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.530
 You will not save yourself instantly unless 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.320
 you have water very close is very complicated 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.580
 Okay and Mr. Pig dismisses the gameplay 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.960
 remember that you can give a little hand 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.060
 up and I'll leave you with the others 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.430
 two traps in the snow I loved 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.100
 do this tutorial and greetings and up 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.810
 morning agent button like like like no 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.180
 like you 're not going sir here it 's like 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.990
 do not you do not vote me like I blow you up is to see 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.990
 here that gives you an option
