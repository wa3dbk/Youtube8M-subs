00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:21.270

 nobody present is to say for this sector 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650
 nobody has come to say that they come to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.380
 relieve that they come to see that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 present that they do the work as 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 what do they have to do we sit back 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 of a desk and lying about the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 press that they were here because here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.960
 there was no one how many families are 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 the affected families can be 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.480
 this I do not know but they are almost all almost 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.370
 I see all my daughter here 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.340
 this has all the walls that have been 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.600
 flipped inside is a mess they have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 that also understand that impossible 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.980
 we can get to each of the houses and 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.570
 if particularly the one that people 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.700
 intends that the mayor be in each 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.890
 one the houses are 280 families I was 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 makes it really impossible and you have to have 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.710
 a whole situation is extremely serious is 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 one of the many affected areas a 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.430
 reality that is repeated dozens of times 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.959
 in all the mountains 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.240
 fortunately the solidarity was 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 immediate 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.460
 filled each of the centers of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.380
 evacuated where they will continue to attend 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:33.290
 dozens of neighbors we have nothing more 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.450
 mattress of good directors clean and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.270

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.710
 absolutely everything and I saved myself because my 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.900
 wounds 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.170

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.510
 water came up here is impressive 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.030
 how it has been but good we are alive not 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.470
 you have to follow him it was amazing the way 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.090
 that people were brought back by 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 self-will 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.170

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 incredible something unexpected but it's so much 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.080
 the demand so much despair because 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.870

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000
