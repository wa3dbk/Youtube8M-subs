in the last one are synthetic paint

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.039 
in the last one are synthetic paint
brushes<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.630> Corel<00:01:30.630> Painter

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
pro or things like artrage you had paint
brushes<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.210> simulate<00:01:36.720> real<00:01:37.560> paint

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
brushes that would simulate real paint

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.539 
brushes that would simulate real paint
strokes<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:39.979> sketchbook<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> too

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
strokes and now sketchbook has that too

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.830 
strokes and now sketchbook has that too
and<00:01:43.549> these<00:01:44.549> brushes<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.329> blend<00:01:45.570> together

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and these brushes will blend together

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
and these brushes will blend together
and<00:01:46.790> simulate<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.970> though<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> were<00:01:48.210> painting

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450

thing they've added is French curves and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
thing they've added is French curves and
this<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.280> very<00:02:38.489> similar<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.180> ruler<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930

this is very similar to the ruler and
ellipse<00:02:40.260> tools<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.700> you'll<00:02:41.879> just<00:02:41.970> draw<00:02:42.209> along

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
ellipse tools so you'll just draw along

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.679 
ellipse tools so you'll just draw along
the<00:02:42.569> line<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.989> it'll<00:02:43.230> create<00:02:44.359> good<00:02:45.359> curves

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
the line and it'll create good curves

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.750 
the line and it'll create good curves
for<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.109> use<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.639> other

tools<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:49.049> adjust<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.829> size<00:02:50.659> rotation

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
tools you can adjust the size rotation

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.050 
tools you can adjust the size rotation
but<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.739> also<00:02:52.889> have<00:02:53.099> several<00:02:53.400> different
