 actually very well in the Premier League 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.450

 premier league experience and that that that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.250
 knows what he wants 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.960
 who is very happy with the next step 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.989
 is a career feyenoord another step 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.040
 higher and wants to work very hard to get themselves 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 develop further in this 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 leavening and crazy about football 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.880
 and see such a special stadium 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.090
 after that you can hardly like it 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.090
 yet 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.230
 Yes 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.280

 [Music] 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.920
 what do you want to achieve with Feyenoord found 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 season we assume how it is now 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 we are European 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 start playing so that will be a very nice one 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.030
 experience and you hear it personally 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.860
 play so much and and the club you 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.840
 help as much as possible 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.119
 but yes i think it is very clear 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 is that next year also just yes 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.890
 all of them must go with the title fight 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 participate 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.189
 and in that also say the only thing I can do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 doing is yes my card is doing best 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.759
 trying to be important every week 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.899
 for the club john is a classic 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.000
 left leg has a great one of course 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.920
 kicking technique that is an extra weapon for that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.750
 him any free standard situation 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.459
 about the looks group or a free kick 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.380
 is actually life threatening 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.519
 good game insight and me properly 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.709
 walking capacity 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.519
 and can actually be three three four 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.950
 positions 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.420
 play in our in our system yes that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.370
 just makes it a great addition 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.390
 value for our selection of failure guys 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.620
 now empty but it is already starting 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.630
 itch when you stand 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.329
 of course this is i would say 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.739
 you actually do need the stadium 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.420
 nothing about explaining that speaks 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.100
 also for itself that is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.930
