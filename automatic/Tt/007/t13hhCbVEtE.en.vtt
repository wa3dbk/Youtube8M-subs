00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
into the same place you see that's why I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619

benefits<00:00:52.219> because<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:53.670> add<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
benefits because if they don't add to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
benefits because if they don't add to
your<00:00:54.210> life<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.870> subtract<00:00:55.289> from<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
your life then they subtract from it and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
your life then they subtract from it and
if<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.610> nothing<00:00:56.640> -<00:00:57.059> oh<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
if they don't do nothing - oh that's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
if they don't do nothing - oh that's
just<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.020> bad<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.800> breaking<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.489> isn't

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
just as bad because breaking even isn't

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.830 
just as bad because breaking even isn't
an<00:01:00.180> exact<00:01:00.600> profit<00:01:01.190> listen<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.480> humans<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.660> look

an exact profit listen as humans we look

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
an exact profit listen as humans we look
at<00:01:03.960> our<00:01:04.110> surroundings<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.949> learn<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> adapt

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
