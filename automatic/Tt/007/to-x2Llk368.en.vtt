00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
but I'm sticking with my gut feeling on

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.990 
but I'm sticking with my gut feeling on
this<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.229> because<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.159> amount<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.520> bug

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
this and because of the amount of bug
