was taking off the rear fairing I
noticed<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.189> saw<00:01:56.549> something<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.060> there

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
noticed that I saw something in there

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.219 
noticed that I saw something in there
and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.899> world<00:01:57.990> was

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and I was like what in the world was

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.899 
and I was like what in the world was
that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.590> thought<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> shim<00:01:59.640> maybe

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that I thought it was like a shim maybe

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.630 
that I thought it was like a shim maybe
something<00:02:00.329> broke<00:02:00.509> off<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> they<00:02:00.990> shim<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
something broke off and they shim the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.620 
something broke off and they shim the
fairing<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> keep<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.090> rattling<00:02:03.329> or

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
fairing to keep it from rattling or

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.130 
fairing to keep it from rattling or
something<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.500> once<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.630> once<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.750> got<00:02:06.960> inside

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
something but once I once I got inside

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
something but once I once I got inside
there<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.369> hope<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.509> see<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
there it actually hope you can see that

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.499 
there it actually hope you can see that
it<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
it is a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.729 
it is a
pack<00:02:10.599> of<00:02:10.810> gum<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.430> guess<00:02:13.230> whoever<00:02:14.230> had<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
pack of gum that I guess whoever had the

progress<00:03:02.319> on<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.829> never<00:03:03.190> imagined<00:03:03.670> was

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
progress on this I never imagined was

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.360 
progress on this I never imagined was
going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> go<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> smooth<00:03:04.569> this<00:03:04.750> easy<00:03:05.310> but<00:03:06.310> I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
going to go the smooth this easy but I

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.860 
going to go the smooth this easy but I
got<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.639> main<00:03:06.849> brake<00:03:07.150> light<00:03:07.329> hook<00:03:07.510> up<00:03:07.690> right

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
got the main brake light hook up right

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660 
got the main brake light hook up right
here<00:03:08.019> hooked<00:03:08.500> right<00:03:08.650> into<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.069> they<00:03:09.459> came

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
here hooked right into the they came

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.960 
here hooked right into the they came
with<00:03:11.010> already<00:03:12.010> like<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.220> connector<00:03:12.760> on<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:12.879> end

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
with already like a connector on the end

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
with already like a connector on the end
that<00:03:13.209> hooks<00:03:13.359> up<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.540> your<00:03:13.690> factory<00:03:14.290> wire

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that hooks up to your factory wire

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.099 
that hooks up to your factory wire
harness<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.489> um<00:03:15.699> well<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.449> know<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.599> started

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
harness but um well you know I started

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.409 
harness but um well you know I started
taping<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.500> wires<00:03:17.849> two<00:03:18.849> different<00:03:19.090> colors<00:03:19.389> of

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
taping the wires two different colors of

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.539 
taping the wires two different colors of
tape<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.079> know<00:03:20.410> which<00:03:20.560> ones<00:03:20.769> left<00:03:21.010> which<00:03:21.310> ones

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
tape to know which ones left which ones

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.879 
tape to know which ones left which ones
right<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.239> figured<00:03:22.299> out<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.989> looked<00:03:23.739> on

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
right but then I figured out I looked on

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.280 
right but then I figured out I looked on
here<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.669> and<00:03:25.090> my<00:03:25.269> wiring<00:03:25.629> harness<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.019> got<00:03:26.139> two

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
here and and my wiring harness I got two

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.750 
here and and my wiring harness I got two
different<00:03:26.440> connectors<00:03:26.949> I<00:03:27.040> got<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> gray

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
different connectors I got like a gray

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.110 
different connectors I got like a gray
one

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
one

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.629 
one
I<00:03:28.150> got<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> black<00:03:29.019> one<00:03:29.260> then<00:03:30.010> same<00:03:30.250> thing<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.549> my

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
I got a black one then same thing on my

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.500 
I got a black one then same thing on my
turn<00:03:30.849> signals

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
turn signals

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.089 
turn signals
you<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.260> wires<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.769> come<00:03:32.859> out<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
you know the wires that come out the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.379 
you know the wires that come out the
turn<00:03:33.280> signal<00:03:33.579> have<00:03:33.669> the<00:03:33.760> same<00:03:33.940> connectors

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
turn signal have the same connectors

gray and black and they match up so yeah

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.099 
gray and black and they match up so yeah
motor<00:03:37.750> signals<00:03:37.959> are<00:03:38.230> here<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.569> wired<00:03:40.900> up

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
motor signals are here when I wired up

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.140 
motor signals are here when I wired up
my<00:03:41.319> front<00:03:41.889> turn<00:03:42.099> signals<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.579> cut<00:03:42.819> off<00:03:42.970> the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
my front turn signals I cut off the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.280 
my front turn signals I cut off the
factory<00:03:44.970> connectors<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.840> see<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.169> one

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
factory connectors and you see that one

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.839 
factory connectors and you see that one
right<00:03:47.410> there<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.620> cut<00:03:47.829> that<00:03:47.949> off<00:03:48.099> factory

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
right there I cut that off factory

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.729 
right there I cut that off factory
connectors<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.389> there<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> wired<00:03:50.230> my<00:03:50.500> wires

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
connectors on there and I wired my wires

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.530 
connectors on there and I wired my wires
up<00:03:50.949> to<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.129> factory<00:03:51.400> connectors<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.090> made

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
up to the factory connectors and made

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.180 
up to the factory connectors and made
the<00:03:52.660> process<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:53.079> lot<00:03:53.349> easier<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.859> know<00:03:54.010> no

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
the process a lot easier you know no

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.610 
the process a lot easier you know no
sodding<00:03:54.639> nothing<00:03:55.299> like<00:03:55.419> that<00:03:55.599> no<00:03:56.049> soldering<00:03:56.470> I

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
sodding nothing like that no soldering I

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
yeah I hooked everything everything up

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.039

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
to make sure it works right now I'm just

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.170 
to make sure it works right now I'm just
wrapping<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.560> wire<00:04:11.590> there<00:04:12.099> I<00:04:12.280> don't<00:04:13.060> like

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
wrapping the wire there I don't like

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.930 
wrapping the wire there I don't like
these<00:04:13.329> loose<00:04:13.569> wires<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.049> I'm<00:04:14.109> just<00:04:14.290> going<00:04:14.409> to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
these loose wires so I'm just going to

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.370 
these loose wires so I'm just going to
rewrap<00:04:15.940> them<00:04:16.120> keep<00:04:16.539> them<00:04:16.659> all<00:04:16.780> nice<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.199> tight

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
rewrap them keep them all nice and tight

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.099 
rewrap them keep them all nice and tight
I<00:04:17.620> love<00:04:18.010> well<00:04:18.969> you<00:04:19.060> guys<00:04:19.180> take<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.539> look<00:04:19.810> here

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
I love well you guys take a look here

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.260 
I love well you guys take a look here
now<00:04:20.409> it<00:04:20.590> came<00:04:20.769> with<00:04:20.950> resistors

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
now it came with resistors

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.070 
now it came with resistors
to<00:04:23.610> slow<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.819> rate<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.449> turn<00:04:25.629> signal<00:04:25.990> how

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
to slow the rate of the turn signal how

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.260 
to slow the rate of the turn signal how
fast<00:04:26.319> it<00:04:26.500> flashes<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:27.099> didn't<00:04:27.940> install<00:04:28.270> those

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
fast it flashes I didn't install those

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.570 
fast it flashes I didn't install those
you<00:04:31.270> guys<00:04:31.419> see<00:04:31.569> a<00:04:31.599> blink<00:04:31.900> in<00:04:31.990> there<00:04:32.580> yeah

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
you guys see a blink in there yeah

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.040 
you guys see a blink in there yeah
there's<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.240> left<00:04:34.479> one

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
there's the left one

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.740 
there's the left one
I<00:04:35.080> didn't<00:04:35.500> install<00:04:35.830> those<00:04:35.979> because<00:04:36.370> uh<00:04:36.479> it<00:04:37.479> for

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
I didn't install those because uh it for

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.390 
I didn't install those because uh it for
one<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.020> said<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.319> gets<00:04:38.470> real<00:04:38.680> hot<00:04:38.860> hot<00:04:39.159> enough

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
one it said it gets real hot hot enough

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.629 
one it said it gets real hot hot enough
that<00:04:39.580> can<00:04:39.699> melt<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.319> plastics<00:04:41.319> and<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:42.460> two<00:04:42.610> I

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
that can melt the plastics and for two I

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.980 
that can melt the plastics and for two I
really<00:04:43.030> don't<00:04:43.180> know<00:04:43.270> much<00:04:43.300> about<00:04:43.449> them<00:04:43.870> I

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
really don't know much about them I

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.499 
really don't know much about them I
don't<00:04:44.050> know<00:04:44.199> where<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.470> could<00:04:44.620> put<00:04:44.770> them

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
don't know where I could put them

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.879 
don't know where I could put them
so<00:04:46.509> anyways<00:04:47.789> everything<00:04:48.789> works<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.479> I<00:04:49.599> will

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
so anyways everything works and I will

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.260 
so anyways everything works and I will
break<00:04:50.889> light<00:04:51.129> works<00:04:51.340> too<00:04:51.550> but<00:04:51.789> I<00:04:51.819> can't<00:04:52.090> reach

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
break light works too but I can't reach

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.830 
break light works too but I can't reach
a<00:04:52.389> pardon<00:04:52.810> filming<00:04:53.560> at<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.710> same<00:04:53.860> time<00:04:54.069> but<00:04:54.340> um

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
a pardon filming at the same time but um

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.210 
a pardon filming at the same time but um
so<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.870> didn't<00:04:56.110> install<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.500> resistors<00:04:56.979> I

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
so I didn't install the resistors I

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.110 
so I didn't install the resistors I
don't<00:04:57.400> know<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.699> about<00:04:57.880> them<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.060> don't

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
don't know if and about them I don't

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.730 
don't know if and about them I don't
know<00:04:58.210> where<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.449> put<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.229> they<00:04:59.349> get<00:04:59.530> hot

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
know where to put them and they get hot

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.219 
know where to put them and they get hot
so<00:05:00.270> whatever<00:05:01.270> I'm<00:05:01.599> not<00:05:01.750> going<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.930> put<00:05:02.020> them<00:05:02.080> on

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
so whatever I'm not going to put them on

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.320 
so whatever I'm not going to put them on
flash<00:05:03.220> there<00:05:03.430> blinks<00:05:03.789> maybe<00:05:03.970> more<00:05:04.210> it'll

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
flash there blinks maybe more it'll

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.779 
flash there blinks maybe more it'll
catch<00:05:04.599> people's<00:05:04.960> attention<00:05:05.280> that<00:05:06.280> I'm

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
catch people's attention that I'm

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.820 
catch people's attention that I'm
turning<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.360> maybe<00:05:07.900> less<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.139> a<00:05:08.319> chance<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
turning and maybe less of a chance to a

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.920 
turning and maybe less of a chance to a
pull<00:05:09.460> out<00:05:09.550> front<00:05:09.849> me<00:05:09.940> less<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.509> chance<00:05:10.750> I

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
pull out front me less of a chance I

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.779 
pull out front me less of a chance I
don't<00:05:10.960> know<00:05:11.139> you<00:05:11.319> know<00:05:11.409> people<00:05:11.740> are<00:05:12.580> stupid

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
it's all put back together you see the

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.159 
it's all put back together you see the
light<00:05:39.159> is<00:05:39.400> on<00:05:39.669> there<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.330> that's<00:05:40.449> it<00:05:40.719> man<00:05:40.960> it

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
light is on there and that's it man it

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.999 
light is on there and that's it man it
went<00:05:41.319> fast<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:42.069> was<00:05:42.219> really<00:05:42.460> surprised<00:05:47.009> they

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
went fast I was really surprised they

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.529 
went fast I was really surprised they
they<00:05:48.430> made<00:05:48.610> everything<00:05:48.940> easy<00:05:49.150> over<00:05:49.419> there

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
they made everything easy over there

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.999 
they made everything easy over there
like<00:05:50.080> clear<00:05:50.409> alternatives<00:05:51.069> they<00:05:51.219> just<00:05:53.009> just

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
like clear alternatives they just just

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.620 
like clear alternatives they just just
made<00:05:54.190> it<00:05:54.310> where<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.520> connect<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.330> up<00:05:55.419> and

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
made it where you connect it up and
