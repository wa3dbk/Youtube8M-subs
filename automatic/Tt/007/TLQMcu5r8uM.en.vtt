and interlace so I think it's better to
believe<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:15.980> something<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.489> nothing<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.540> to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
believe in something that nothing and to

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
believe in angels I think is a very

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.209 
believe in angels I think is a very
positive<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.849> good<00:02:20.030> thing
