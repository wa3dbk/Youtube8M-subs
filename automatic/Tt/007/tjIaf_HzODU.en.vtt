and and for the team I thought the heat
plays<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> big<00:00:12.480> part<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.960> obviously<00:00:13.639> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
plays a big part in it obviously the

point<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.760> view<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.380> performance

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
point of view I think performance

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.710 
point of view I think performance
against<00:00:22.560> Villarreal<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.480> was<00:00:24.480> better

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
against Villarreal was was better

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.810 
against Villarreal was was better
defensively<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.800> slightly<00:00:26.220> offensively

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
defensively and slightly offensively

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.310 
defensively and slightly offensively
then<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.359> against<00:00:27.750> your<00:00:27.869> owner<00:00:28.050> when

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
then it was against your owner when

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.609 
then it was against your owner when

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
didn't think things click for us quite

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.319

away<00:00:31.890> should<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.149> what

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
away should do but then that's what

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
away should do but then that's what
pre-seasons<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.170> we'll<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.649> getting<00:00:35.340> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
obviously that the team performance

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
wasn't quite up to scratch so there's a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
wasn't quite up to scratch so there's a
shame<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:13.140> onto<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> next<00:01:13.650> one

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
shame so just look onto the next one

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
shame so just look onto the next one
while<00:01:14.700> you've<00:01:14.880> been<00:01:14.909> playing<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> made

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
while you've been playing that you made

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
while you've been playing that you made
some<00:01:15.810> both<00:01:16.049> games<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.680> buff<00:01:16.830> lines<00:01:17.100> changed

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
some both games the buff lines changed

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
some both games the buff lines changed
around<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.030> terms<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.360> personnel

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
around you know in terms of personnel

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
around you know in terms of personnel
different<00:01:19.380> players<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.619> been<00:01:19.799> coming<00:01:20.070> on

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
different players have been coming on

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.620 
different players have been coming on
how<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> found<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.330> dealing

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
how have you found that you know dealing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
how have you found that you know dealing

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
with different personnel yeah I think

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
with different personnel yeah I think
it's<00:01:23.520> good<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.540> what's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it's good it's just it's like what's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.999 
it's good it's just it's like what's
gonna<00:01:24.930> happen<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> future<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.799> you're

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
gonna happen in the future and you're

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.109 
gonna happen in the future and you're
not<00:01:26.100> always<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.640> playing<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.060> same

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
not always going to be playing the same

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.179 
not always going to be playing the same
player<00:01:27.540> every<00:01:27.869> game<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.130> about

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
player every game so it's all about

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
player every game so it's all about
getting<00:01:29.460> used<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> different<00:01:30.390> people's<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
getting used to different people's is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.810 
getting used to different people's is
going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> new<00:01:31.979> person<00:01:32.159> every<00:01:32.460> week<00:01:32.700> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going to be a new person every week you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
going to be a new person every week you
never<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:34.920> test<00:01:35.159> for

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
never know so I think it's good test for
