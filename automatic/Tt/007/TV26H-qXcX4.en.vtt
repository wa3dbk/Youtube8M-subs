 which allows us to have a capacity 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.800
 distribution and classification of 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.150
 less between four thousand to five thousand 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.650
 packages per hour 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.809
 formerly our processes 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.250
 link to internal systemic levels 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.020
 but there was also a lot of manual process

 internal produced much loss of the already 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.920
 optimize times and information 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.899
 online was the solution that info site 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 offered turbus cargo with the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.009
 infoport tool to a system that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.170
 by software loaded to about

 system in such photos in turbus cargo 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 tax worked jointly with 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.630
 the company movistar the main

 your looking for the contribution of info sites to 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.269
 strategic levels was based on that 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.739
 all his charges never saw him as a 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.569

 so that this work could be developed 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 how it developed having a level of 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.580
 effectiveness and efficiency in 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.340
 implementation since its inception and that today 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.170
 day has not been able and that does not allow us to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.250
