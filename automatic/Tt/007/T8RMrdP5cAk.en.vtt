00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.770 
calculate a route 29 56 west grand
avenue<00:04:55.230> oakland<00:04:55.830> california<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.970> then<00:04:57.210> if<00:04:57.360> in

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
avenue oakland california and then if in

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.300 
avenue oakland california and then if in
fact<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.140> want<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.470> go<00:04:58.560> there<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.010> would<00:04:59.130> just

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
fact you want to go there you would just

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.400 
fact you want to go there you would just
say<00:04:59.400> ok<00:04:59.820> or<00:05:00.000> press<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.390> button<00:05:00.780> down<00:05:00.960> here<00:05:00.990> and

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
say ok or press the button down here and

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.810 
say ok or press the button down here and
then<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:01.920> going<00:05:02.040> to<00:05:02.130> start<00:05:02.310> guiding<00:05:02.610> you

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
then it's going to start guiding you

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.190 
then it's going to start guiding you
where<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.600> want<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:05.480> now<00:05:06.480> as<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:06.750> noticed

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
where you want to go now as you noticed

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.280 
where you want to go now as you noticed
maybe<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.760> don't<00:05:09.030> know<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.930> physical

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
maybe you don't know the physical

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.620 
maybe you don't know the physical
address<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.890> may<00:05:11.130> just<00:05:11.370> know<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.060> name<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.510> a

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
address you may just know the name of a

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.710 
address you may just know the name of a
place<00:05:12.840> for<00:05:13.440> instance<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.430> young<00:05:14.940> museum<00:05:15.360> or

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
place for instance the young museum or

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.340 
place for instance the young museum or
maybe<00:05:16.410> know<00:05:16.800> by<00:05:17.550> category<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:19.170> is

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
maybe know by category and this is

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.410 
maybe know by category and this is
really<00:05:19.650> useful<00:05:19.890> because<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.730> find<00:05:21.120> all

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
really useful because you can find all

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.390 
really useful because you can find all
kinds<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.930> places<00:05:22.170> this<00:05:22.620> way<00:05:22.830> let's<00:05:23.220> say

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
kinds of places this way let's say

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.300 
kinds of places this way let's say
restaurants<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.390> then<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.200> decide<00:05:25.800> which

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
restaurants and then you decide which

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.220 
restaurants and then you decide which
kind<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.760> restaurant<00:05:27.090> in<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.780> way<00:05:27.930> I'm<00:05:28.050> going

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
kind of restaurant in the way I'm going

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.430 
kind of restaurant in the way I'm going
down<00:05:28.710> this<00:05:29.130> list<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.360> just<00:05:30.600> by<00:05:30.720> rotating<00:05:30.990> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
down this list is just by rotating the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.110 
down this list is just by rotating the
button<00:05:31.740> once<00:05:32.340> again<00:05:32.640> in<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:33.000> center<00:05:33.330> stack<00:05:38.120> so

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
button once again in the center stack so

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.360 
button once again in the center stack so
that's<00:05:39.330> basically<00:05:39.630> how<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.680> navigation

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
that's basically how the navigation

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.730 
that's basically how the navigation
system<00:05:41.400> works<00:05:42.030> now<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:46.080> navigation<00:05:46.710> system

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
system works now the navigation system

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.970 
system works now the navigation system
is<00:05:47.340> very<00:05:48.060> easy<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.480> use<00:05:48.510> as<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:48.960> said<00:05:49.200> but<00:05:49.770> you

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
is very easy to use as I said but you

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.710 
is very easy to use as I said but you
should<00:05:50.190> read<00:05:50.460> your<00:05:50.670> manual<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.360> really

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
should read your manual to really

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.810 
should read your manual to really
optimize<00:05:51.900> everything<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.950> you<00:05:53.040> can<00:05:53.160> do<00:05:53.340> with

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
optimize everything that you can do with

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.510 
optimize everything that you can do with
the<00:05:54.030> navigation<00:05:54.510> system<00:05:54.710> also<00:05:55.710> over<00:05:56.310> here<00:05:56.490> I

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
the navigation system also over here I

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.040 
the navigation system also over here I
have<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.820> info<00:05:57.300> button<00:05:57.620> where<00:05:58.620> as<00:05:59.930> long<00:06:00.930> as

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
have the info button where as long as

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.850 
have the info button where as long as
