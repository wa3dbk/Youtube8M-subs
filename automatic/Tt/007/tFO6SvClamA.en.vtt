whenever they're flying above you freeze
them<00:01:30.830> they<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.039> you<00:01:31.220> can<00:01:31.340> basically<00:01:31.550> use<00:01:31.789> them

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
them they can you can basically use them

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.910 
them they can you can basically use them
as<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.119> new<00:01:32.209> kind<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.420> attack<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.319> they<00:01:33.500> fall<00:01:33.770> on

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
as a new kind of attack so they fall on

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.919 
as a new kind of attack so they fall on
enemies<00:01:34.479> we<00:01:35.479> have<00:01:35.599> all<00:01:35.690> these<00:01:35.780> different

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
enemies we have all these different

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.229 
enemies we have all these different
things<00:01:36.050> that<00:01:36.670> were<00:01:37.670> introduced<00:01:38.030> into<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:38.239 
things that were introduced into the

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:40.449 
things that were introduced into the
game<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:39.020> really<00:01:39.289> kind<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> mix<00:01:40.099> it<00:01:40.220> up<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
game to really kind of mix it up and

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:41.979 
game to really kind of mix it up and
have<00:01:40.640> some<00:01:40.759> really<00:01:40.940> cool<00:01:41.090> combat<00:01:41.509> mode<00:01:41.780> cool

I<00:01:46.450> think<00:01:47.450> borland's<00:01:47.810> as<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:47.960> franchise<00:01:48.440> so

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
I think borland's as a franchise so

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.050 
I think borland's as a franchise so
