00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
and I think you'd be ok with most

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.490 
and I think you'd be ok with most
coaches<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.480> don't<00:00:29.779> think<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:29.990> problem<00:00:30.290> with

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
coaches I don't think the problem with

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.630 
coaches I don't think the problem with
you<00:00:30.590> in<00:00:30.770> this<00:00:30.829> move<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.099> a<00:00:31.189> little<00:00:31.550> bit

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
you in this move it's a little bit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.730 
you in this move it's a little bit
flashy<00:00:31.880> but<00:00:32.119> it's<00:00:32.210> not<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.110> flashy<00:00:33.380> that<00:00:33.710> I

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
flashy but it's not so flashy that I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140 
flashy but it's not so flashy that I
think<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.250> know<00:00:34.310> most<00:00:34.490> coaches<00:00:34.850> will<00:00:34.970> care
