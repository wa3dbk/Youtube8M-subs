 newly arrived from the plant in Honda in Brazil finally arrived in Argentina 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.200
 to him put the city 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.099
 a car 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.160
 expected and that in Brazil one month after its presentation achieved the sales record 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.509
 within its segment sales segment 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.829
 I read it depends on how we are actually studying it in the world, "he said. 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.390
 we are smiling 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.500
 a touch exceeds segment b and is close enough to segment c 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.619
 although the reality with the theme that the subsegments have been invented 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.280
 we would be talking about a 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 see more poulsen - 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 this city honda car uses the motorization 1 point 5 of contagion and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.810
 also shares with the honda fit the platform but place to establish 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.180
 signaled a minivan it has been thought that a self després body society with 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.160
 paul we are talking about an engine of your night live said 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.850
 of course four-cylinder a camshaft to the head with 16 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.089
 valves like that and what else is known 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.849
 Ivette like bulls really is very efficient especially at the consumer level 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.740
 they are engines 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.120
 working jaap a high regime 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.820
 wondering what the maximum power do the same and in this case only 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.000
 120 horses 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.430
 will be six thousand 600 laps as the maximum torque that is at 4400 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.020
 starting in 2009 after the coup, the change responds progressively 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 of course, but optimally, the engine feels 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.010
 happy of course responds with more activity starting at 4 thousand 505 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.800
 turns 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 by condemning the statements 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.390
 the maximum is 193 kilometers per hour in fifth gear to 6600 next to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.329
 this is a regime 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.329
 extremely high that asks the box is underway 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 benefits 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.050
 how long do we take the hoop from 0 to 100 eleven points 2nd 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 min 32 points 3 to cover we saw with stopped departure the good kilometer 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 consumption is really miserable the one we are talking about 8 ago 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 liters every 100 kilometers in the city 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.150
 well and killed him by hour in constant fifth speed is below 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 the 7 liters and 130 kilometers per hour at constant speed and fifth 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 is below 11 years old 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.299
 he thinks some missing ones that are quite important if he does not have a jet 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.209
 retains of course 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.430
 the security galibier 2 frontal carvalho but does not have for example 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.400
 traction control and social stability insists that the law dry 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.629
 we link supported by a 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.590
 the dealer braking for an everest but in general that a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.790
 equipment or relatively scarce so to speak in any way with regard to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.790
 some cars of the competition of the segment c 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.429
 with respect to habitability I think it is one of the most 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.689
 really remarkable this new honda city and another very important thing is that 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.509
 it goes a great capacity of trunk has more than 500 liters of capacity 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.479
 Regarding behavior, without any doubt, priority has been given to 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.769
 or the comfort of walking especially let's say the circulation in ccoo city 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.989
 on highways and Cuban and how do not sell clothes 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.259
 we do not link does not leave us to wish 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:31.389
 when there are crosswinds it is noted that it has a certain sensitivity for another 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.299
 part in my city is a utopia if one handles his olive with the basilio car the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.339
 rear suspension when it grabs some irregularity has a tendency still 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 small bounce as if it were a little to life 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.509
 the central console added the sr with the automatic climate control 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.499
 of the spasming good audio team considering that it is a team of six 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.029
 in 2005 the handling motion relatively correct but for those of 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.969
 more than one meter eighty we tried with some limitation in the peraleda not 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.579
 is deep enough but the steering wheel can be adjusted in height and 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.069
 diamond depth the setting is not too wide and neither too many of 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.999
 the novel of the series 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.049
 and another problem that has besides that the wheel that regulates backup is 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.859
 located very close to the parante therefore you have to have codes of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.389
 pianist moschino sacrifice the one that the Jews the graveyard control for the 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.389
 decade 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.939
 for now the way to address one of the most conflictive issues address 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.270
 assisted 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.940
 when he shows his car 23 thousand 900 dollars or practically 24 thousand 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.300
 dollars is positioned among its faithful and but very slightly above by 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.520
 on top of the fic 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.150
 very slightly below the 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.970
 then the question that what the reason for the existence of soon 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.219
 this vehicle 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.249
 this is the time for the youths and effects or the pins 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:09.270
 against let's start with the together in favor as I said rear seats 

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:14.610
 really very broad that are worthy of a bus segments b would say capacity 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.549
 of trunk more than 500 liters and comes the mouth of load before relatively 

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:23.020
 small consumption that really miserable as I said before the both 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.699
 the brake pedal is really a very firm touch that conveys safety and for 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.040
 another part the 3 year warranty has a thousand kilometers has an image of 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.039
 brands well earned by two what boys and girls 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:37.910
 but the cons 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.890
 conventional design the German pose and as I said up to 1 75 does not carry any 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.210
 kind of problems what I say more than a meter eighty of the find 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.340
 some kind of limitations will continue to be seen laterally and as I said on the map 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.570
 rumoroso skype not treated the target price as we discussed murátov not what 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.610
 leaves well placed against the rivals including those of the c segment 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.260
 2 anyway I think it's a car that is going to have 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:08.009
 a good impact on the market at the level of the family group because it is a 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.680
 good alternative for which you do not want to have a people carrier with the fib case 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.100
 but I also think it's a very good alternative to having a civil 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.300
 basic and that in other times a much smaller equipment with respect to 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.110
 this one simple 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.300
 and on the other hand yesterday a direct competition with a price quite for 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.990
 under tents and being a slingshot it is to be assumed that it will end up being a 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.470
 opponent
