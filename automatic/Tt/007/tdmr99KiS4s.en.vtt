like if you're gonna say I want to go in

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.170 
like if you're gonna say I want to go in
the<00:05:59.570> mountains<00:05:59.720> where<00:06:00.530> there's<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:01.849> know<00:06:01.880> a

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
the mountains where there's you know a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.050 
the mountains where there's you know a
hundred<00:06:02.510> percent<00:06:02.810> safety<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:04.190> will<00:06:04.370> get<00:06:04.639> zero

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
hundred percent safety you will get zero

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.480 
hundred percent safety you will get zero
you<00:06:05.330> can't<00:06:05.630> go<00:06:05.900> there's<00:06:06.320> always<00:06:06.620> an<00:06:07.009> objective

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
you can't go there's always an objective

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.129 
you can't go there's always an objective
hazard<00:06:07.849> Vince<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.509> so<00:06:08.659> why<00:06:08.750> don't<00:06:08.900> we<00:06:08.960> go<00:06:09.080> to

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
hazard Vince and so why don't we go to

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.649 
hazard Vince and so why don't we go to
the<00:06:09.349> mountains<00:06:09.710> in<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.830> first<00:06:10.070> place<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:11.030> no

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
the mountains in the first place and no

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.180 
the mountains in the first place and no
one<00:06:11.690> will<00:06:11.990> talk<00:06:12.139> about<00:06:12.470> that<00:06:12.680> and<00:06:12.860> then<00:06:13.070> you

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
one will talk about that and then you

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.370 
one will talk about that and then you
see<00:06:13.370> these<00:06:13.520> people<00:06:13.729> sawing<00:06:14.389> they're<00:06:15.139> doing

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
see these people sawing they're doing

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.930 
see these people sawing they're doing
routes<00:06:15.590> like<00:06:15.800> moonlight<00:06:16.070> boat<00:06:16.340> race<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.789> half

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
routes like moonlight boat race and half

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.240 
routes like moonlight boat race and half
dumb<00:06:17.210> stuff<00:06:17.690> Peter<00:06:17.900> craft<00:06:18.110> does<00:06:18.289> thousands<00:06:19.159> of

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
dumb stuff Peter craft does thousands of

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.430 
dumb stuff Peter craft does thousands of
people<00:06:19.520> have<00:06:19.639> climbed<00:06:19.909> this<00:06:20.060> stuff<00:06:20.300> it's<00:06:20.539> it's

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
people have climbed this stuff it's it's

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.680 
people have climbed this stuff it's it's
almost<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:22.070> controlled<00:06:22.520> setting<00:06:22.820> as<00:06:23.090> as<00:06:23.330> much

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
almost a controlled setting as as much

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.110 
almost a controlled setting as as much
as<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:24.020> can<00:06:24.169> be<00:06:24.380> there's<00:06:24.590> you<00:06:25.310> know<00:06:25.430> there's

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
as it can be there's you know there's

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.939 
as it can be there's you know there's
not<00:06:26.270> gonna<00:06:26.479> be<00:06:26.630> like<00:06:26.780> some<00:06:27.259> block<00:06:27.530> is<00:06:27.800> gonna

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
not gonna be like some block is gonna

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.589 
not gonna be like some block is gonna
come<00:06:28.159> flying<00:06:28.520> off<00:06:28.789> and<00:06:29.060> hit<00:06:29.240> you<00:06:29.360> in<00:06:29.389> the<00:06:29.570> head

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
come flying off and hit you in the head

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.550 
come flying off and hit you in the head
I<00:06:29.810> mean<00:06:30.020> there's<00:06:30.199> yeah<00:06:30.500> there's<00:06:30.680> like<00:06:30.800> a

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
I mean there's yeah there's like a

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.950 
I mean there's yeah there's like a
miniscule<00:06:33.669> chance<00:06:34.669> of<00:06:34.970> that<00:06:35.090> but<00:06:35.539> it's<00:06:35.690> it's

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
miniscule chance of that but it's it's

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.270 
miniscule chance of that but it's it's
it's<00:06:36.229> so<00:06:36.560> interesting<00:06:36.860> because<00:06:37.070> it's

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
it's so interesting because it's

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.850 
it's so interesting because it's
actually<00:06:37.430> it's<00:06:38.120> human<00:06:38.570> control<00:06:38.990> like<00:06:39.500> if

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
actually it's human control like if

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.350 
actually it's human control like if
there's<00:06:40.159> an<00:06:40.340> air<00:06:40.460> if<00:06:40.639> something<00:06:41.030> happens

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
there's an air if something happens

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.540 
there's an air if something happens
soloing<00:06:41.840> it's<00:06:42.080> because<00:06:42.530> you<00:06:42.800> failed<00:06:43.099> as<00:06:43.370> a

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
soloing it's because you failed as a

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.430 
soloing it's because you failed as a
human<00:06:44.030> and<00:06:44.419> then<00:06:44.509> like<00:06:44.659> the<00:06:44.810> panel<00:06:45.110> was<00:06:45.199> saying

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
human and then like the panel was saying

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.620 
human and then like the panel was saying
there's<00:06:46.219> just<00:06:46.400> there's<00:06:47.000> a<00:06:47.060> greater<00:06:47.300> chance

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
there's just there's a greater chance

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.149 
there's just there's a greater chance
that<00:06:47.960> you're<00:06:48.260> gonna<00:06:48.349> get<00:06:48.500> killed<00:06:48.770> on<00:06:48.979> the<00:06:49.130> way

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.159 
that you're gonna get killed on the way

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.200 
that you're gonna get killed on the way
to<00:06:49.310> decry

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
to decry

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.120 
to decry
driving<00:06:50.870> than<00:06:51.350> you<00:06:51.470> are<00:06:51.590> actually<00:06:51.860> being

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
there so it's kind of a non-issue for a

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.420 
there so it's kind of a non-issue for a
