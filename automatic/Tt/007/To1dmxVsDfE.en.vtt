looks like on the inside see if I can
get<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.230> there<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:30.519> all<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.940> ports<00:03:31.269> and

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
get you in there is all the ports and

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.949 
get you in there is all the ports and
let's<00:03:32.769> see<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.699> can<00:03:33.879> see<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> rubber<00:03:34.389> gaskets

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
let's see you can see the rubber gaskets

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.059 
let's see you can see the rubber gaskets
around<00:03:35.230> there<00:03:35.379> this<00:03:35.560> looks<00:03:35.769> like<00:03:35.859> a<00:03:35.949> pretty

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
around there this looks like a pretty

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.830 
around there this looks like a pretty
durable<00:03:36.400> case<00:03:36.730> but<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> feels<00:03:37.180> kind<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.569> thing

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
durable case but it feels kind of thing

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.289 
durable case but it feels kind of thing
so<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.739> don't<00:03:38.949> know<00:03:39.010> about<00:03:39.129> that<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.209> the
