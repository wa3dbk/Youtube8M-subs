now we've got the screws out we should

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.590 
now we've got the screws out we should
just<00:00:44.120> be<00:00:44.210> able<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.420> pull<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.870> end<00:00:45.140> cap<00:00:45.770> off

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
can see a spirit connector and these

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.560 
can see a spirit connector and these
need<00:00:59.920> removing<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.940> best<00:01:04.059> way<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.269> get<00:01:04.449> em

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
need removing so the best way to get em

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.710 
need removing so the best way to get em
off<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.839> with<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.019> pair<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.320> long<00:01:05.800> nose<00:01:05.979> pliers

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
off is with a pair of long nose pliers

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.510 
off is with a pair of long nose pliers
if<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:07.990> grip<00:01:08.200> them<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.619> then<00:01:09.130> pull<00:01:09.369> them

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
if you just grip them and then pull them

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:22.650 
if you just grip them and then pull them
off<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.180> next<00:01:22.390> thing<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.509> need<00:01:22.630> to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
off and then the next thing you need to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.120 
off and then the next thing you need to
do<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:22.930> just<00:01:23.050> put<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> screwdriver<00:01:23.470> in<00:01:23.860> there

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
do is just put a screwdriver in there

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:39.450 
do is just put a screwdriver in there
and<00:01:24.369> just<00:01:25.240> gently<00:01:25.690> lever<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:27.030> brush<00:01:28.030> out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.590 

and<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:40.580> do<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.880> same<00:01:41.060> at<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.240> opposite

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and then do the same at the opposite

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.990 
and then do the same at the opposite
side<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.290> can<00:01:45.410> see<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.770> there<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.730> a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
side and you can see that there is a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.580 
side and you can see that there is a
little<00:01:47.360> bit<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.540> wear<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:47.900> them<00:01:48.080> but<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:48.500> not

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
little bit of wear on them but it's not

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.150 
little bit of wear on them but it's not
that<00:01:49.070> excessive<00:01:49.610> yet<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:51.410> that's<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.040> old

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
that excessive yet so that's the old

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.360 
that excessive yet so that's the old
push<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:52.520> will<00:01:52.670> replace<00:01:53.120> in<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:55.190> is<00:01:55.250> a

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
push that will replace in and this is a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.630 
push that will replace in and this is a
new<00:01:55.580> one<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:57.890> can<00:01:58.580> see<00:01:58.790> that<00:02:00.580> there's<00:02:01.580> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
new one and you can see that there's a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.110 
new one and you can see that there's a
little<00:02:01.820> bit<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.030> difference<00:02:02.330> between<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.750> two

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
little bit of difference between the two

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.310 
little bit of difference between the two
that<00:02:05.120> Bush<00:02:05.390> isn't<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.750> particularly<00:02:06.050> about

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
that Bush isn't in particularly about

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.780 
that Bush isn't in particularly about
condition<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.190> doesn't<00:02:07.400> reveal<00:02:07.520> any

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
condition and it doesn't reveal any

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.160 
condition and it doesn't reveal any
changing<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.420> because<00:02:08.660> I've<00:02:08.750> had<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.990> drill

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
changing but because I've had the drill

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.100 
changing but because I've had the drill
five<00:02:09.440> years<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:10.670> think<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.420> good<00:02:11.540> idea<00:02:11.690> just

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
five years I think it's a good idea just

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.690 
five years I think it's a good idea just
to<00:02:12.170> replace<00:02:12.560> them<00:02:12.770> because<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.250> only<00:02:13.610> about

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
to replace them because it's only about

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.920 
to replace them because it's only about
15<00:02:13.910> quid<00:02:14.330> for<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.540> new<00:02:14.720> set<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.709> bushes<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.930> then

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
15 quid for a new set of bushes and then

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.750 
15 quid for a new set of bushes and then
I'll<00:02:18.170> actually<00:02:18.620> say<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.250> use<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
I'll actually say if they use just a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.280 
I'll actually say if they use just a
spare<00:02:20.060> ones<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.600> case<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.959> ever<00:02:21.080> do<00:02:21.260> need

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
spare ones just in case I ever do need

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.730 
spare ones just in case I ever do need
them<00:02:21.620> again<00:02:22.300> once<00:02:23.300> things<00:02:23.540> get<00:02:23.660> one<00:02:23.930> saw<00:02:24.440> fired

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
them again once things get one saw fired

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.699 
them again once things get one saw fired
down<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.600> drill<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:26.959> start<00:02:27.200> working<00:02:27.380> in

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
down the drill will start working in

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.020 
down the drill will start working in
there's<00:02:27.860> also<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.190> chance<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:28.730> you'll<00:02:28.850> damage

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
there's also a chance that you'll damage

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.330 
there's also a chance that you'll damage
the<00:02:29.570> commutator<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.620> back<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> mortar

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
the commutator on the back of the mortar

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.270 
the commutator on the back of the mortar
there<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.530> always<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.800> good<00:02:33.890> idea<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
there so it's always a good idea to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.740 
there so it's always a good idea to
change<00:02:34.459> them<00:02:34.760> before<00:02:35.060> they<00:02:35.209> actually<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.570> need

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
change them before they actually do need

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.140 
change them before they actually do need
changing<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.459> bushes<00:02:37.760> are<00:02:37.880> actually

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
changing so the bushes are actually

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.030 
changing so the bushes are actually
identical<00:02:39.070> what<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.280> goes<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:41.950> with<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
identical what one goes in with the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.199 
identical what one goes in with the
spare<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.370> actually<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.670> top<00:02:43.850> learn<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
spare can actually the top learn the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.580 
spare can actually the top learn the
other<00:02:44.330> ones<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.570> spade<00:02:44.810> catch<00:02:45.080> at<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> bottom

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
other ones a spade catch at the bottom

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.259 
other ones a spade catch at the bottom
there<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.400> can<00:02:46.670> actually<00:02:46.820> put<00:02:47.090> them<00:02:47.180> in

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
there so you can actually put them in

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.420 
there so you can actually put them in
the<00:02:47.360> wrong<00:02:47.450> way<00:02:47.510> around<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:49.070> get<00:02:49.160> them<00:02:49.310> in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the wrong way around so to get them in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.620 
the wrong way around so to get them in
all<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.120> slot<00:02:50.390> them<00:02:50.540> in

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
all you have to do is slot them in

00:02:50.630 --> 00:03:01.509 
all you have to do is slot them in
position

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.660 

by<00:03:02.519> lining<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:04.519> then<00:03:05.519> just<00:03:05.700> push<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:07.670> till

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
by lining that up then just push it till

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:21.940 
by lining that up then just push it till
it<00:03:08.790> goes<00:03:08.909> all<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.150> way<00:03:09.269> in

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.210 

so<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.100> just<00:03:23.190> line<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.460> up<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.070> just

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
so you just line it up and then just

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.300 
so you just line it up and then just
push<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.670> firmly<00:03:27.800> till<00:03:28.800> it's<00:03:28.950> all<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> way

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
push it in firmly till it's all the way

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.270 
push it in firmly till it's all the way
in<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:30.480> then<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.440> reconnect<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
in and then you can just reconnect the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.490 
in and then you can just reconnect the
Spade<00:03:32.520> connector<00:03:33.380> by<00:03:34.380> pushing<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.830> back<00:03:35.010> on

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.630 

and<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.250> same<00:03:41.430> at<00:03:41.580> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
and then you can do the same at the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.240 
and then you can do the same at the
opposite<00:03:41.970> side<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.740> leaking<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.860> out<00:03:43.980> spare

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
opposite side just leaking it out spare

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.560 
opposite side just leaking it out spare
connector<00:03:45.740> so<00:03:46.740> as<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.100> see<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.520> both<00:03:48.390> of

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
connector so as you can see the both of

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.450 
connector so as you can see the both of
the<00:03:48.660> bushes<00:03:49.020> are<00:03:49.230> pushed<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.710> as<00:03:49.920> far<00:03:50.190> as<00:03:50.370> they

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
the bushes are pushed in as far as they

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.570 
the bushes are pushed in as far as they
can<00:03:50.640> go

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
can go

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.280 
can go
you've<00:03:53.580> now<00:03:53.730> got<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.060> make<00:03:54.240> sure<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:55.110> these

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
you've now got to make sure that these

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.190 
you've now got to make sure that these
two<00:03:55.350> wires<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.910> clips<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.930> correct

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
two wires it clips in the correct

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.910 
two wires it clips in the correct
positions<00:03:58.910> and<00:04:00.140> then<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.290> can<00:04:01.440> replace<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
positions and then you can replace the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.270 
positions and then you can replace the
end<00:04:02.040> cap<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> we'll<00:04:04.709> just<00:04:04.860> make<00:04:05.010> sure<00:04:05.160> that

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
end cap so we'll just make sure that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:17.030 
end cap so we'll just make sure that
they're<00:04:05.490> all<00:04:05.520> tight<00:04:05.910> now<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.709> when<00:04:16.919> you've

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
they're all tight now so when you've

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.320 
they're all tight now so when you've
done<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.760> we<00:04:18.000> connect<00:04:18.239> your

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
done that you can we connect your

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:26.390 
done that you can we connect your
battery<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.859> give<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.160> try<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:26.370> that's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
battery and then give it a try so that's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.760 
battery and then give it a try so that's
how<00:04:26.850> easy<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.390> change<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.900> bushes<00:04:28.560> on

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
how easy it is to change the bushes on

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.450 
how easy it is to change the bushes on
the<00:04:29.340> DeWalt<00:04:29.669> xip<00:04:30.330> range<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.169> drills<00:04:31.470> it's<00:04:31.980> very

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
the DeWalt xip range of drills it's very

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.700 
the DeWalt xip range of drills it's very
easy
