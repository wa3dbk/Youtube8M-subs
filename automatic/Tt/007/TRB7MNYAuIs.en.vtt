the<00:04:40.120> professional<00:04:41.010> show<00:04:42.810> people<00:04:43.810> use<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:45.040> that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
the professional show people use in that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.070 
the professional show people use in that
they<00:04:45.460> don't<00:04:45.610> get<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:45.940> calf<00:04:46.240> into<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.840> chute

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
they don't get the calf into the chute

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.610 
they don't get the calf into the chute
at<00:04:47.230> all

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
at all

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.890 
at all
they<00:04:47.920> simply<00:04:48.400> spend<00:04:49.120> time<00:04:49.360> with<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.660> calf

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
they simply spend time with the calf

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.320 
they simply spend time with the calf
sometimes<00:04:50.770> it<00:04:50.950> takes<00:04:51.130> 15<00:04:51.340> minutes<00:04:51.820> sometimes

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
sometimes it takes 15 minutes sometimes

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.470 
sometimes it takes 15 minutes sometimes
20<00:04:52.840> 30<00:04:53.140> maybe<00:04:53.410> even<00:04:53.590> 40<00:04:54.160> minutes<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:55.090> it's<00:04:55.300> a

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
20 30 maybe even 40 minutes but it's a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.080 
20 30 maybe even 40 minutes but it's a
low<00:04:56.200> stress<00:04:56.590> method<00:04:56.860> it's<00:04:57.250> low<00:04:57.520> stress<00:04:57.850> for

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
low stress method it's low stress for

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.940 
low stress method it's low stress for
the<00:04:58.150> handler<00:04:58.540> it's<00:04:58.930> low<00:04:59.260> stress<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.860> the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
the handler it's low stress for the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.250 
the handler it's low stress for the
animal<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.880> I'm<00:05:00.940> going<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.360> adjust<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.840> halter

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
animal so I'm going to adjust the halter

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.490 
animal so I'm going to adjust the halter
and<00:05:02.790> try<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.850> put<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.120> on<00:05:04.300> again<00:05:04.750> notice<00:05:05.350> the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
and try to put it on again notice the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.470 
and try to put it on again notice the
calf<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.980> relatively<00:05:06.730> calm<00:05:06.970> he's<00:05:07.270> not

calf is relatively calm he's not

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.720 
calf is relatively calm he's not
fighting<00:05:07.780> me<00:05:07.960> he's<00:05:08.470> not<00:05:08.650> fighting<00:05:09.100> the<00:05:09.490> Rope

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
fighting me he's not fighting the Rope

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.670 
fighting me he's not fighting the Rope
really<00:05:10.710> he's<00:05:11.710> he's<00:05:12.280> just<00:05:12.610> uh<00:05:13.169> he's<00:05:14.169> really<00:05:14.440> not

position I am right-handed and I need to

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.690 
position I am right-handed and I need to

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
stand on his left side to put this

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.730 
stand on his left side to put this
halter<00:05:58.120> on<00:05:58.150> it's<00:05:58.660> more<00:05:58.900> comfortable<00:05:59.410> for<00:05:59.530> me

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
halter on it's more comfortable for me

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.830 
halter on it's more comfortable for me
and<00:06:00.100> so<00:06:00.490> I'm<00:06:00.640> going<00:06:00.760> to<00:06:00.850> have<00:06:01.030> to<00:06:01.180> work<00:06:01.390> to<00:06:01.630> move

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
and so I'm going to have to work to move

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.230 
and so I'm going to have to work to move
him<00:06:02.110> in<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.650> position<00:06:02.979> that<00:06:03.190> will<00:06:03.820> allow<00:06:04.000> me<00:06:04.210> to

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
him in a position that will allow me to

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.280 
him in a position that will allow me to
get<00:06:04.540> the<00:06:04.600> halter<00:06:04.990> on

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.880 

again<00:06:12.010> I<00:06:12.130> used<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.520> show<00:06:12.730> stick<00:06:13.470> just<00:06:14.470> rubbing

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
again I used the show stick just rubbing

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.150 
again I used the show stick just rubbing
on<00:06:15.010> him<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.660> and<00:06:16.660> trying<00:06:17.470> to<00:06:17.560> move<00:06:17.710> him<00:06:17.950> into

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
on him and and trying to move him into

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.190 
on him and and trying to move him into
position<00:06:18.790> so<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.240> he<00:06:19.480> knows<00:06:19.630> that<00:06:19.690> he<00:06:20.050> can

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
position so that he knows that he can

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.900 
position so that he knows that he can
trust<00:06:20.440> me<00:06:20.680> I'm<00:06:20.890> not<00:06:20.920> here<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.370> hurt<00:06:21.580> him<00:06:21.730> and

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
trust me I'm not here to hurt him and

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.750 
trust me I'm not here to hurt him and
it's<00:06:22.420> simply<00:06:22.720> a<00:06:22.840> part<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.040> process<00:06:24.550> of

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
it's simply a part of the process of

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:38.800 
it's simply a part of the process of
getting<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.360> know<00:06:25.420> each<00:06:25.570> other

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.870 

the<00:06:39.810> reason<00:06:40.170> we'd<00:06:40.320> put<00:06:40.530> this<00:06:40.710> halter<00:06:41.070> on<00:06:41.220> is<00:06:41.550> to

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
the reason we'd put this halter on is to

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.660 
the reason we'd put this halter on is to
show<00:06:42.090> animals<00:06:42.570> at<00:06:42.750> a<00:06:43.140> fair<00:06:43.530> maybe<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.310> State

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
show animals at a fair maybe a State

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.340 
show animals at a fair maybe a State
Fair<00:06:45.000> or<00:06:45.030> even<00:06:45.510> at<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.660> regional<00:06:46.170> or<00:06:46.320> national

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
Fair or even at a regional or national

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.000 
Fair or even at a regional or national
fair<00:06:47.010> and<00:06:47.250> so<00:06:47.760> these<00:06:48.300> this<00:06:49.140> technique<00:06:49.710> is<00:06:49.950> a

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
fair and so these this technique is a

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.550 
fair and so these this technique is a
really<00:06:50.880> nice<00:06:51.060> way<00:06:51.360> of<00:06:51.390> doing<00:06:51.870> this<00:06:52.020> there's

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
really nice way of doing this there's

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.790 
really nice way of doing this there's
not<00:06:52.890> really<00:06:53.220> many<00:06:53.700> reasons<00:06:54.240> that<00:06:54.800> anybody

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
not really many reasons that anybody

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.250 
not really many reasons that anybody
would<00:06:56.010> put<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.250> halter<00:06:56.610> onto<00:06:56.940> a<00:06:56.970> cow<00:06:57.240> but<00:06:57.960> when

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
would put a halter onto a cow but when

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.870 
would put a halter onto a cow but when
that's<00:06:58.410> done<00:06:58.680> it's<00:06:59.040> nice<00:06:59.250> if<00:06:59.520> it<00:06:59.610> can<00:06:59.730> be<00:06:59.850> done

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
that's done it's nice if it can be done

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.420 
that's done it's nice if it can be done
in<00:07:00.180> a<00:07:00.270> low<00:07:00.420> stress<00:07:00.780> manner<00:07:01.110> which<00:07:01.380> is<00:07:01.410> what<00:07:02.340> I'm

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
in a low stress manner which is what I'm

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.590 
in a low stress manner which is what I'm
trying<00:07:02.700> to<00:07:02.760> illustrate<00:07:03.630> here<00:07:04.140> today
