00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hi everybody sarko today to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.220
 turn for a video it's special 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 so a video on iron sight is not 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 a video as usual a life te 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.509
 tvp with a joystick 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 ps4 it's a challenge that i started 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.880
 here I tried to do useful with 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 a joystick of ps 4 may be enough 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 difficult would have never made a small 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.490
 config of the joystick to play at 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 minecraft is precisely that kill them 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.890
 So here we go to the spawn here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.340
 so I do not know what it's going to give 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.629
 I have a little bit more boks 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 I'm more follow the flow when we 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.960
 can death twice it takes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.970
 we know if I win more dead 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.640
 that I am I have you nogent for the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.820
 only problem actually it's going to be 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.190
 throw in po and sprinter what is it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.290
 you know, but you have to pay 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.020
 twice on on the challans tattoo and 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.440
 since we always danced to her hair 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440
 perhaps 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.390
 work that I galÃ¨re 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.900
 officer of the world I can not have but 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.490
 it is rather that 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.940
 ok from the site there so I dare to even 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.600
 touch 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.600
 But this is also the war 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.070
 like this here I tell you it's going to be 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.990
 very very very heavy very very bearish 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.990
 are thin 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.490
 Yes 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.490
 tastes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.719
 I did a bit of a cliff test 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.420
 is true that we can click fast enough 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:18.390
 with a group joystick about as 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.370
 quickly that with the sweet yes I close to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.819
 cyclic per second with the mouse or 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.819
 with the joystick 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.400
 I'm sure that it's not the case 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.230
 when it's messy pay4me would say 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.300
 securicor the canvas 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:53.060
 media sensitivity could really 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.460
 when I believe I had to put him zero 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.460
 not bad shot 0 coup 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.980
 fry 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360
 m 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.450
 swear it's really the prefect it's more 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.940
 hard is when you have avoided playing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.800
 minecraft with a pc there is more 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.280
 style fps it's like a little bit 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.280
 on call of 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.209
 I 'm going too hard 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.050
 if they will put a little bit of life into 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.050
 know more 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.560
 I swear it's really hard it's 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.630
 really difficult 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:02.730
 the hardest thing I think is to throw the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:05.100
 potions world I can tap on with 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.430
 x when I really do not know how easy 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.430
 like that we want this metal or glass 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.610
 it can do for you a few meters 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.610
 square 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.669
 I'm wrong because lamp button is 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.580
 really hard in addition if we put in 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.580
 sleep really gets to do it 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.559
 really fast avoiding that but 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.559
 I really not at all used to it 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.160
 some can enjoy it 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.999
 body 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.200
 maybe you should not take a sheet 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.920
 shit actually i squarely with a com 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.920
 site is really aware 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.160
 the fabry controller really more possible 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.070
 like that we understand quickly the hand 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.480
 understands quickly makes the mark quickly 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.480
 against his ex-wife 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.910
 Simon 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.979
 not like this 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.979
 but in 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:03.270
 it's really hard to play there it cracks 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:07.630
 is either I eat little shit go 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.570
 hello apple shit shit what is it 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:19.030
 that shu 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:20.740
 here is the lime or masked max max sure wants 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.290
 it's really hard it looks like maybe 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.660
 not like that I'm having trouble not 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.440
 possible in addition I cracked happy 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.680
 Okay 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.780
 it's okay we're just 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.730
 after to restart the reboot 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:44.050
 after we are right after 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:45.780
 Japan's startup is too hollow so 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.120
 I put a little thyme on 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.660
 reconnect the cost of his party that's 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.800
 Too bad 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:57.100
 always indeed your life so 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.400
 now are not gone have not 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.400
 part 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.009
 the twins nothing you expect no other 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.009
 thing 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.510
 I really do it wherever they go 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:24.270
 Besides, I'm dead you know here 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:27.360
 it was nice it was more fun 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.150
 at least I have tried to grandpa on the 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.990
 road made with a ps4 language 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.910
 it's rather original, it's a 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.640
 little bit bad because I'm dead 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:42.920
 quite soon it's true that there was the 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.670
 raise that a little embarrassed me but go 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.670
 on this no more
