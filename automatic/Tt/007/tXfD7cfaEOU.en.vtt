00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.940
 Yes, I am Maracaju. 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.520
 speaks people in the area and how 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.390
 Can you see if I bring another video to 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.919
 you 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.869
 and as usual the jec of here to today 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:28.939
 I'll talk about one probably going to be 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.489
 a very controversial subject but it's me 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.730
 talk today about what I thought of the call 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.370
 of duty black ops 2 and attitude of 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.980
 treyarch about the game 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.970
 good this game throwing a riot at my 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.300
 time was I swear joÃ£o mateus and the solid e 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:57.410
 I was with a big focus of this 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.710
 load faster and this one I do not 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.680
 I was playing because I did not have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.530
 still released at the start I played a lot 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.450
 well I playing very well back in 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.939
 When it went well, it's done very well. 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.259
 I do not want it enabled 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.140
 because I'm afraid not to catch but I 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.670
 there were some playing arminia playing and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 it was only in the pounds do you know these should 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.409
 affect a little quick shot of foot 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.010
 because it is even disclosed the walt seems 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.820
 Who's there but did not have the select yet? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.820
 Fire, and let's get down to business. 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:44.560
 at 21 the new call of duty and I have 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.939
 some criticisms 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.650
 I'm going to confess to you I almost do not 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.100
 I'm playing confidante no no is not 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.750
 So it is, do not call me attention. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 I was more of a confident 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.740
 without innovation but changed the scores 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 citrix and it's really something new you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.970
 change the trio score strike a 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:12.709
 innovation is only roman a strike no more 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:18.319
 now has the mutual advantage is a way of 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:21.420
 new game and it's not too anything to 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.230
 I did not bring anything so much that 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.380
 and I'm not able to play fell 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.450
 I really did not catch my eye. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.489
 I'm not in the mood for the black 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 ops fulfill all the delights the first 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.150
 and if I do not think I'll even tell because 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.170
 I allowed myself a ps3 training game. 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 and I saw that on ps3 it's worth the quality 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.890
 graphic is horrible 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.260
 I do not know why but they played the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.720
 graphic quality there wii ps3 and looks 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.160
 to cool giving a support of the epe 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.019
 result and I'm really enjoying 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.640
 so fun is fun to play 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.440
 with the guys but I do not have it alone 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:11.819
 I really do not have to play 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.470
 and I just did not play the way I told you 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.180
 me he was one more confidante of the same 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.549
 way it was mw2 mw3 plus a case of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.250
 my name 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.410
 the next I speak of multiplayer 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.620
 now the single player was very good of 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.709
 be able to choose which end gives the 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.019
 play your attitudes in the game that was 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.910
 a huge innovation 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.950
 This time I saw that they took a 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.459
 little head of multiplayer type of 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.190
 gre and improve somewhat the ingo this was 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.570
 I really enjoyed the show. 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.820
 It is compared to the other nine of them and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.350
 basically so multiplayer is more 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.459
 confident and I did not like the maps 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.650
 even because I was seeing the maps 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.480
 competitive are very few map up 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.540
 the maps are very bad for champion 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.640
 cute little guy is a very good place there 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.030
 mimi itahum yes scrotum really caram 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.989
 never give up do not call much attention 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.410
 these new maps from block 2 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.520
 but this is for me 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.230
 d - is it possible to say yes the maps that 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.300
 There is no denying it is not much more. 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:36.530
 beautiful the maps too is colorful and me 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.120
 at least I liked the network so much 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.480
 is a part despite being a brand 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.300
 lots of camera but it is a lot of field but 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.860
 It's very beautiful, I like to play 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.860
 it's the network 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:05:02.060
 I liked him 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.340
 so he sells a lot but does not show the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.370
 that he sells could improve for example 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.130
 from the river three or four 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.030
 is an example of the difference in multiplayer 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:18.170
 and the single player is huge is huge is 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.580
 so you can not compare the two are 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.280
 fps is but the difference is too big 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.490
 are two very good games and the river 3 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.670
 at 4 the great difference is great 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.320
 can bring a video you also want 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.890
 bring there 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.980
 the analysis of the history and everything but for 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:45.020
 This is what I found remembering this is 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:49.640
 My opinion you what you liked 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.130
 The bad game is that it is very fan. 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.919
 and it's no use if the game is a 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.320
 dude he says it's good but it's the game 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.030
 is not bullshit the game just in me 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.270
 amused amusing me black ops 1 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.860
 mw and 2 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.820
 Now I'm going to talk about the attitude of the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:12.669
 tri art is I confess I was disappointed 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:15.370
 much with treyarch is in appearance 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.260
 mostly pc 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.810
 one thing that made me very happy was 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.120
 from tanner fan of rice eg pwm 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:29.240
 smc dude and we could not play of mmc 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:32.539
 and so it was so my top on the pc 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.150
 I 'll be sorry but the tri article me 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.240
 shame so I was sad to know 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.480
 they turned their backs know that many 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.300
 Kisses game on pc and that mind dropped 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:50.840
 dubbing and Portuguese is the support that 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.490
 are giving the pc is always the last netta 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.080
 aa the whole update is the last 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.480
 announced that it is the latest update is the 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.780
 last they are dropping the pc where 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.560
 Formerly the focus was leaving me 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:09.110
 sad and what he says I agree more 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.940
 is the following an expensive dubbing is like the 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.540
 wire for the staff of the court 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.540
 did face got modified this game did not 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.280
 Are you at work and this for me? 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.540
 burning the treyarch showing that it is 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.610
 lazy 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.070
 does not even then I thought pretty soon will stop 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.210
 to make pc games and will force the staff 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.510
 buy a console 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.640
 I'll tell you is to play a pc and 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.380
 play on the console teacher on the console 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.790
 but depending on the game for example the 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:43.760
 focus goes on in the console is type is 30% 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.780
 do not have 1 12% and on the pc and thus 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:49.760
 get up and leave me a little 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:52.430
 Disappointed as to that, people are 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.710
 I wanted to talk about coffee today . 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.300
 I had to take it there, right? 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.180
 I think he did not show Fred but I 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:02.030
 It was 40-something bar 17 stuff 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:04.640
 so he keeps a lot in this match he gave 

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:08.630
 a badass in the riot that I was joÃ£o 

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.900
 luck and I hope you enjoyed and even 

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.900
 next
