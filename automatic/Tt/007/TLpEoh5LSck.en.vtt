i'll<00:02:27.110> say<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.770> very<00:02:28.070> very<00:02:28.310> easy<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.850> do

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
i'll say this it's very very easy to do

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720 
i'll say this it's very very easy to do
use<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> silencer<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.860> free<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:31.460> all<00:02:31.550> it's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
use a silencer and free for all it's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.730 
use a silencer and free for all it's
very<00:02:32.060> important<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.710> are

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
very important that you do there are

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.320 
very important that you do there are
different<00:02:34.220> strategies<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.760> will<00:02:34.850> work<00:02:35.060> if

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
different strategies that will work if

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.060 
different strategies that will work if
you<00:02:35.420> don't<00:02:35.450> use<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> silencer<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.920> easiest

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
you don't use a silencer but the easiest

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.640 
you don't use a silencer but the easiest
one<00:02:37.490> is<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:38.030> use<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.300> silencer<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.290> stay<00:02:39.500> off

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
one is to use a silencer and to stay off

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.710 
one is to use a silencer and to stay off
the<00:02:39.770> radar<00:02:40.010> because<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:40.850> someone<00:02:41.030> spawns<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
the radar because if someone spawns the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.930 
the radar because if someone spawns the
first<00:02:42.110> thing<00:02:42.320> they're<00:02:42.530> going<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.860> do<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.250> look

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
first thing they're going to do is look

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.760 
first thing they're going to do is look
for<00:02:44.000> someone<00:02:44.570> on<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> radar<00:02:45.080> shooting<00:02:45.620> their

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
for someone on the radar shooting their

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.940 
for someone on the radar shooting their
gun<00:02:45.980> near<00:02:46.520> them<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.000> if<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.650> are
