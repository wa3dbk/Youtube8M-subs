00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.280
 hi friends, how are we going to go for another 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.740
 program and this program I found out 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.220
 not aware and I've heard it 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.560
 we went out on a program in the morning in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.119
 tracks in sing fricandÃ³ matiner pues 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.730
 this dessert or what you have dedicated to 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.220
 you that we like this section and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.619
 very simple and you will see we are going to do 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.970
 a lemon mousse for which 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.710
 Logically clear egg from the house 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.649
 clear that particularly from one of the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 I like three squeezed lemons 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.340
 and liquid saccharin is already there is nothing 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.140
 more so let's start and you'll see 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.120
 how are you going to like it, let's go to it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.070
 It is worth as I said very simple 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.070
 egg white 300 grams 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 let's make a dessert 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.470
 with an amount that is fast 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.330
 and that it is for 12 people very 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.850
 simple again we take the clear of 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.650
 egg 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.490
 mixer 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.490
 and battery 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.400
 as always had been said 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.990
 what we are going to achieve with the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.370
 fighting the egg is to put air 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.770
 we get the little bubbles and that's what 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.270
 that will give us the texture of the mousse 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.220
 of lemon for come 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.150
 as you see 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.840
 is already taking the form goes 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.840
 thrilling the egg white 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.260
 and that air is entering that is what we 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.260
 will give the texture of the mousse 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.450
 tips do not be more than three minutes 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.360
 four with the blender but only for 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.010
 heat the mixture and it will lower us 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.310
 now is the time 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.770
 if I can I can not now if we take 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.770
 saccharine to likes me with 5 chorritos 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.960
 the three lemons squeezed 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.550
 and it is done to finish mixing 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.690
 let's microwave 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.800
 4 to 6 minutes depends on each microwave 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 now he has a little trick to know 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.700
 when it's done entirely 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.239
 and there is the lemon mousse made by 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.239
 nothing once the mixture made 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 as simple as going to the microwave and 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.030
 what I have told you advice to put first 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 four minutes and then at the time of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.489
 take out to see here that it will be a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.680
 for a part that has set and 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.629
 Maybe the other one below is clarita 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.640
 we put one more minute and so on until 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.670
 let's see the whole mixture completely 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.829
 curd is worth come to the micro as 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.420
 You see look at the pint that has 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.609
 little bubbles that this is what is going to 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.970
 give the texture of the mousse open 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.970
 micro 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.730
 and what I have told you we are going to put 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.380
 four minutes and we wait to see how 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 remains 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.210
 that explained before as you see I have 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.040
 put four minutes and he has stayed 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.110
 all curdled there are times here 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.580
 down in a transparent asshole as well as 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 white then you have to put a minus 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.510
 I remove more now with the four minutes 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 then it has been perfect, well, 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.170
 we already have as explained before 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.490
 completely set the mousse and as 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.710
 We 're going to do this at home and it's for 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.930
 we are all home and there is no need 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.750
 make beautiful presentations or anything like 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.510
 and how you have it in the cold mold 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.530
 once of course always with 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.860
 room temperature 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.320
 never hot to cold you will see 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.000
 when it takes cold temperature what 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.790
 you can cut in two as you want urged 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.610
 to you as you wish and eat now 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.110
 you will see the impressive texture of mousse 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.300
 of authentic lemon that is going to have the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.070
 Super concentrated flavor of lemon 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.260
 for those of you who are more 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.140
 just time and a little more dogs 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.110
 for example you can pull desserts type 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.310
 clear strawberry banana or chocolate lemon 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.690
 cookies that have an assortment of 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.480
 product and the truth that very good of 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.120
 flavor and with a contribution of protein and zero 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.320
 fats quite important then nothing 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750
