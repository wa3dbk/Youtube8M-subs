I build these LS cars for people or for

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.790 
I build these LS cars for people or for
myself<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.059> always<00:00:36.690> put<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:37.230> gauges<00:00:37.469> in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
myself I always put these two gauges in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.280 
myself I always put these two gauges in
one<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.700> engagement<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.390> two<00:00:39.750> gauges<00:00:39.960> are

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290

you<00:00:43.230> should<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.579> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you should have them because you can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
you should have them because you can
detect<00:00:45.030> problems<00:00:45.360> before<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.320> become<00:00:46.410> big

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
detect problems before they become big

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.869 
detect problems before they become big
problems<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> should<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.670> able<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
problems that you should be able to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.889 
problems that you should be able to
assume<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> might<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.480> able<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> fix

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
assume that you might be able to fix

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.569 
assume that you might be able to fix
before<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> hand<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
before they get out of hand and get to a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
before they get out of hand and get to a
point<00:00:50.670> where<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> can't<00:00:51.120> fix<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.480> alright

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
point where you can't fix them alright

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
point where you can't fix them alright
now<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.910> talking<00:00:54.210> about

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
now when you're talking about

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.319 
now when you're talking about
aftermarket<00:00:55.260> gauges<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.250> GM<00:00:56.550> never<00:00:56.910> not

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
aftermarket gauges because GM never not

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.950 
aftermarket gauges because GM never not
that<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that I know of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.240 
that I know of
back<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:58.770> building<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.070> cars

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
back when you're building these cars

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
back when you're building these cars
never<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.820> had<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.510> guess<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:00.989> didn't

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
never really had a I guess they didn't

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.270 
never really had a I guess they didn't
have<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> loyal<00:01:01.500> pressure<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.890> never<00:01:02.129> have

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have a loyal pressure but never have

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
have a loyal pressure but never have
fuel<00:01:02.579> pressure<00:01:02.789> gauge<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.239> stock<00:01:03.510> fuel

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
fuel pressure gauge a stock fuel

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
fuel pressure gauge a stock fuel
pressure<00:01:03.960> gauge<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.949> you're<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pressure gauge so you're gonna have to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
pressure gauge so you're gonna have to
get<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.210> aftermarket<00:01:06.540> gauges<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.470> wanna

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
get these aftermarket gauges and I wanna

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.899 
get these aftermarket gauges and I wanna
show<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.770> exactly<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.310> hooked<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.760> up

show you exactly how I hooked them up
okay<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> helped<00:01:09.780> mine<00:01:10.020> them<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.010> this

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
okay how I helped mine them up on this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.289 
okay how I helped mine them up on this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
prefer to electric because what happens

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.080 
prefer to electric because what happens
is<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.950> mechanical<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.939> might

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
is when you have mechanical you might

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.130 
is when you have mechanical you might
have<00:01:33.240> seen<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:33.869> cars

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
have seen them on some of these cars

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
have seen them on some of these cars
they<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.680> thin<00:01:35.009> nylon<00:01:35.280> wire

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
they have this little thin nylon wire

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
they have this little thin nylon wire
and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.180> has<00:01:36.299> oil<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> gauge

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and it has oil going to it to the gauge

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.649 
and it has oil going to it to the gauge
from<00:01:38.189> wherever<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.060> coming<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.540> the

from wherever it's coming from from the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.440 
from wherever it's coming from from the
engine<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.799> read<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> pressure

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
engine and that will read the pressure

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
engine and that will read the pressure

the mechanical some in theory some

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.810 
the mechanical some in theory some
people<00:01:44.939> feel<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.750> little<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.110> more

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
people feel that it's a little bit more

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
people feel that it's a little bit more
accurate<00:01:47.820> than<00:01:48.030> than<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> automat<00:01:49.290> didn't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
accurate than than the automat didn't

that<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.420> I'm

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that one so we just don't know so I'm

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.789 
that one so we just don't know so I'm
gonna<00:01:54.630> show<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> exactly<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.470> went<00:01:55.740> about

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
gonna show you exactly how I went about

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
gonna show you exactly how I went about
hooking<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:56.640> take<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> oil<00:01:57.180> pressure

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
hooking up let's take the oil pressure

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.950 
hooking up let's take the oil pressure
gauge<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> buy<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.960> electric

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
far as the fuel pressure what you got to

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.660 
far as the fuel pressure what you got to
do<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.590> when<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.100> your<00:02:47.160> fuel<00:02:47.490> pressure

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
do is when you get your fuel pressure

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.120 
do is when you get your fuel pressure

out<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> rail<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:13.410> gonna<00:04:13.530> go<00:04:13.710> into<00:04:14.150> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
out the rail it's gonna go into the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.509 
out the rail it's gonna go into the
Medeco<00:04:15.570> adapter<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.590> then<00:04:16.980> you're<00:04:17.130> gonna<00:04:17.220> put

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
Medeco adapter and then you're gonna put

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
sending unit now remember always use

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.710 
sending unit now remember always use
teflon<00:04:25.460> coating<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.730> don't<00:04:26.880> want<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.540> tape

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
teflon coating you don't want the tape

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.030 
teflon coating you don't want the tape
you<00:04:28.170> don't<00:04:28.290> want<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.470> use<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.620> tape<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:28.920> want

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
you don't want to use the tape you want

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.110 
you don't want to use the tape you want
to<00:04:29.100> use<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> paste<00:04:29.520> I'll<00:04:29.700> hold<00:04:29.850> use<00:04:30.030> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
to use the paste I'll hold use the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.280 
to use the paste I'll hold use the
teflon<00:04:30.510> paste<00:04:30.660> when<00:04:30.870> you're<00:04:30.960> dealing<00:04:31.110> with

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
teflon paste when you're dealing with

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.750 
teflon paste when you're dealing with
with<00:04:31.950> uh<00:04:32.010> lines<00:04:32.850> like<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.990> right<00:04:34.140> so

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
with uh lines like this all right so

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.250 
with uh lines like this all right so
that's<00:04:35.760> how<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.480> hook<00:04:36.720> up<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.900> sending<00:04:37.200> unit

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
that's how you hook up the sending unit

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.020 
that's how you hook up the sending unit
and<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.740> -<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.070> these<00:04:38.190> wires<00:04:38.400> will<00:04:38.550> go<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
and you - and these wires will go to the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.540 
and you - and these wires will go to the
gauge<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.770> just<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.920> have<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.190> little<00:04:41.370> clip

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
gauge and just like I have a little clip

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.310 
gauge and just like I have a little clip
right<00:04:41.730> here<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.690> is<00:04:42.840> in<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.960> clip<00:04:43.140> on<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
right here this is in the clip on the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.620 
right here this is in the clip on the
other<00:04:43.350> end<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.160> it's<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.370> really<00:04:44.520> quick<00:04:44.850> really

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
other end so it's a really quick really

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.410 
other end so it's a really quick really
really<00:04:45.960> quick<00:04:46.230> setup<00:04:47.000> all<00:04:48.000> right

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
really quick setup all right

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.080 
really quick setup all right
the<00:04:49.260> fuel<00:04:49.500> pressure<00:04:49.710> gauge<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.340> reading<00:04:50.820> a

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
the fuel pressure gauge is reading a

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.020 
the fuel pressure gauge is reading a
little<00:04:51.420> under<00:04:51.750> 60<00:04:52.080> psi<00:04:52.760> sorry<00:04:53.760> it's<00:04:53.910> blurry

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
little under 60 psi sorry it's blurry

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.869 
little under 60 psi sorry it's blurry
but<00:04:54.390> that's<00:04:54.600> this<00:04:55.200> way<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.560> is

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
but that's this way it is

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.239 
but that's this way it is
but<00:04:57.479> then<00:04:57.629> the<00:04:57.749> oil<00:04:57.990> pressure<00:04:58.199> gauge<00:04:58.319> it

00:04:59.239 --> 00:04:59.249 
but then the oil pressure gauge it

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.079 
but then the oil pressure gauge it
should<00:04:59.459> be<00:04:59.580> somewhere<00:04:59.909> in<00:04:59.999> the<00:05:00.059> neighborhood

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:00.089 
should be somewhere in the neighborhood

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.749 
should be somewhere in the neighborhood
once<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.139> warms<00:05:01.439> up<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:02.369> car<00:05:02.550> has<00:05:02.729> been

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
once it warms up and the car has been

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.339 
once it warms up and the car has been
running<00:05:03.179> for<00:05:03.209> a<00:05:03.330> little<00:05:03.539> bit<00:05:03.659> but<00:05:04.080> once<00:05:04.229> it

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
running for a little bit but once it

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.169 
running for a little bit but once it
warms<00:05:04.499> up<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:05.189> should<00:05:05.369> drop<00:05:05.550> down<00:05:05.819> don't<00:05:06.089> be

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:06.179 
warms up it should drop down don't be
