00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.970 
chunk well considering I was a legate
over<00:03:55.209> there<00:03:55.359> has<00:03:55.600> pretty<00:03:56.200> monstrous<00:03:56.470> attack

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
over there has pretty monstrous attack

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.170 
over there has pretty monstrous attack
itself<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.600> uh<00:03:59.549> he's<00:04:00.549> gonna<00:04:00.790> go<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.000> another

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
itself so uh he's gonna go for another

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.449 
itself so uh he's gonna go for another
thunder<00:04:01.570> fang<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.920> time<00:04:03.100> i<00:04:03.130> guess<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
thunder fang and this time i guess the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.759 
thunder fang and this time i guess the
paradox<00:04:03.910> which<00:04:04.150> kind<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.810> sucks<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.680> know

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
paradox which kind of sucks but you know

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:06.840

it's<00:06:12.000> lightning<00:06:13.000> fast<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:13.570> it<00:06:13.750> packs<00:06:14.110> both

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
it's lightning fast and it packs both

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.920 
it's lightning fast and it packs both
special<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:15.340> physical<00:06:15.669> attacks<00:06:15.850> so<00:06:16.660> I'm<00:06:16.810> just

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
special and physical attacks so I'm just

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.400 
special and physical attacks so I'm just
gonna<00:06:17.050> launch<00:06:17.229> off<00:06:17.410> an<00:06:17.530> ice<00:06:17.620> beam<00:06:17.860> here<00:06:18.070> and

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
gonna launch off an ice beam here and

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.450 
gonna launch off an ice beam here and
take<00:06:20.410> them<00:06:20.530> down<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.800> a<00:06:20.830> pretty<00:06:21.190> much<00:06:21.280> closed

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
take them down to a pretty much closed

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.310 
take them down to a pretty much closed
thread<00:06:21.669> but<00:06:21.880> it<00:06:21.970> also<00:06:22.090> gets<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.450> freeze<00:06:22.840> on

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
thread but it also gets the freeze on

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.409 
thread but it also gets the freeze on
them<00:06:23.500> so<00:06:24.190> that's<00:06:24.370> pretty<00:06:24.760> devastating

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
them so that's pretty devastating

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.850

because<00:06:25.479> someone<00:06:26.050> can<00:06:26.200> koozie<00:06:26.560> probably

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
because someone can koozie probably

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.860 
because someone can koozie probably
