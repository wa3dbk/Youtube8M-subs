 today we are going to see the books that I have 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.390
 bought in the month of January 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.779

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.910
 they buy is from the month they are prodigy and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.939
 champions of the legend trilogy and 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.759
 mary lou these are the last two and of 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.130
 true that now I'm a little before 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.220
 of half in the last and really that 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.450
 this trilogy is amazing do not you 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.250
 I want to say a lot because I'm going to 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.840
 talk then that is what are my 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.899
 opinions of this trilogy is my clothes 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.900
 but if I can tell you that it is located 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.120
 in the future it is a very dystopian future 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.970
 similar to the games of hunger 'and 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.090
 divergent and true that I had heard 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.890
 very good things in sociology here is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.300
 in the three books and really not 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.250
 It is because I have taken so long to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.370
 read it because the truth that is very very 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.520
 good the second book that I bought is 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 a world for julius de bryce echenique 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.100
 I bought this book because of my 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.619
 2015 resolutions that are read more 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.290
 classics this one could be considered 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.090
 a modern Latin American classic 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.740
 true that many people in the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.600
 comments when I asked for some 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 suggestions of the classic I was recommended 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.530
 this 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.939
 I know it is very very fun alfredo 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.250
 Bryce Echenique is well known for 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.439
 have a lot of love when it comes to writing and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.530
 the truth that I hardly saw this cover 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.470
 loved it seems beautiful is a cover 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.649
 of the 40th anniversary of 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.270
 alfaguara and I saw it and I fell in love I think 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.920
 incredible and the truth is that I'm 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.039
 I'm sure I'll love it so 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.220
 I'm dying to read this my third book is 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.560
 looking for alaska de jong and if you 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.539
 I confess something is the first book that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.130
 I'm going to read because I do not read and under the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.659
 same star as everyone else what 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.899
 did but I know what I 'm going to be 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.789
 thinking why you did not read this book and 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.069
 it's because the same wind was going to me 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.649
 buy a friend a very dear friend 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.260
 mine I'm not going to say his name but if 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.350
 loves lulla not me town of end after 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.910
 I fight completely and I do not like it 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.739
 the truth that the thing that I study the most 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.840
 in this life is the spoilers why 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.000
 here I am super local will have 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.540
 tell you guys just in case 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.310
 I injured 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 today I'm going to put this nice stream 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.359
 because really, for me, not because 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.310
 they can do it is brusque and well and I know 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.370
 that for a lot of people too so 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.500
 I hope you never read me and I 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 I promise that I will never do it because 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 the truth is that a world if after 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 is going to be world so this book does not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.560
 a long time ago I really do not know anything 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.019
 I know that the way to write lesson ruiz 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.000
 very cool so I hope I like it and 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.829
 now this book is quite fashionable 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.079
 so I'm dying to start reading 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.780
 things in Lyon ring because I know it's a 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.880
 author very very nice the book cut that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.570
 I bought myself in the bone age of those 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.239
 blankets 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.340
 zhang of this book I have heard 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.500
 very much on youtube there are many 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.769
 autumn ers of usa lohan was 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.810
 reading and they liked a lot is 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.079
 a gigantic saga I think they're going to 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.530
 be eight books are still new 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.060
 two first for sale and when I saw it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.130
 in the bookstore I really got excited 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.840
 a lot because I did not expect it to come 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.920
 so fast peru 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.290
 but if he did and from this book the only 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.019
 What I know is that it's about people 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.790
 that can enter into the dreams of others 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.930
 and other people who also have 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.909
 other similar powers and 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 and nothing that seemed super interesting 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.700
 people so described and the fact that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.620
 someone can come in and see what you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.040
 you are dreaming I even think that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.780
 they can manipulate you and all that, so I've 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.310
 listened to a lot of good things and of 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.469
 I hope you do not delay to enter 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.120
 the following books of anything because 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.530
 there's nothing worse than starting a book and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.239
 you can not read the following because 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.489
 They are watching me bring to your country 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.469
 remove the book following the line of 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.889
 the classics is love in the times 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.480
 of anger by gabriel garcÃ­a marquez 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.519
 This book was also recommended to me 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.139
 heap on my other video has it 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.689
 commented my mom also told me 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.220
 which is an epic love story and of 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.949
 true that is the favorite of many 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.530
 people so there was a bookstore 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.910
 actually it was from second grade books 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.639
 and I thought it was a treasure because 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.020
 only the jan cober if he does not have this 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.540
 pretty thing you have in the books of 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.760
 second I do not know that 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.500
 even though if you can see a 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.510
 little bit more treated in some parts 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.010
 It's super nice to read a book that has already 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.930
 been read has pretty enough 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.840
 history 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.880
 so for me it has been like a rescue 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.500
 of the book I find an excellent purchase 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.380
 because we see that he was also quite 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.289
 cheap for being the second one and I know it's going to 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.630
 be a book that I liked very much 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.539
 and my last book and why I'm 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.539
 recording more excited and grateful is 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.240
 mister mercedes for writing this book 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.220
 really, for me, it's something incredible 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.570
 because I had been - bookstores 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.240
 but I was just seeing it in 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.860
 English and I said until they translate it and 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.990
 bring him in, he's going to spend a lot of 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.180
 time but I did not see it 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.430
 then when I went to buy some 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.139
 books that was already translated had 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.770
 another carrying on the same cover as the 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.810
 which is in English but the same 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.389
 story of course and I'm super 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.150
 happy to understand it, they gave it to me and I know 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.539
 that this is a new genre for stephen 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.060
 king because the good one is well known for 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:35.240
 all your horror novels but this 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.130
 book is more suspense and police well 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.289
 I'm reading some reviews not 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.920
 many because he did not want to fight but he 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:47.300
 it was pretty good enough 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:49.190
 and the back is blue and good 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.660
 these acids all the books that I have 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.850
 bought this month the truth that I did not 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.620
 I want because it started at one point but 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.570
