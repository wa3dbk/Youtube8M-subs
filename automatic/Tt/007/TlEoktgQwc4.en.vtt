 the sister 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.949
 I have a suggestion 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 so thats it 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.349
 I played the first settlers 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 I've made her part clear 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.339
 and lose the supply of meaning 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.339
 Photos Videos Blogs 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.049

 I think this will be played by the Coburg 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.279
 after the stroke are the animal shelters 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.949

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 thereon 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.009
 The transport network says it's 100% ready 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.709
 this is partially blocked 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.389
 I am strictly against it 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.439

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.340

 I know you want to go back as soon as possible 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.359
 but I think it is too early 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.359
 and it is 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 I miss you when necessary 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.849
 You look good 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 in the middle of sick children 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.059
 the really good team to know that you have nothing against Getafe 1 1 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.539
 Paul Kalkbrenner recorded

 No Greece Bank yourself a picture 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.130

 I'm really good 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.430
 the implants work transfer is unclear 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.580
 Dollar Hertha 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.580

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.059
 fought in the League of Nations 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.249
 we thought we had lost him 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.460
 but he is back in service 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.960
 Pascal Hens gave it an experimental optical implant 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.869
 do not worry you have to be sure 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.919
 we have to see that we are not a central user in the month 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.250
 if everything works as planned 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.830
