however D lecture 3 and rook ending a
pawn<00:00:09.120> down<00:00:09.420> which<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:09.929> need<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.230> save<00:00:10.500> in

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
pawn down which we need to save in

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.530 
pawn down which we need to save in
contrast<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.870> lecture<00:00:13.830> 2<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.340> which<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
contrast with lecture 2 in which the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.510 
contrast with lecture 2 in which the
attacking<00:00:15.949> player<00:00:16.949> had<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.000> bishops<00:00:18.690> pawn<00:00:19.520> here

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
attacking player had a bishops pawn here

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.279 
attacking player had a bishops pawn here
he<00:00:21.119> has<00:00:21.359> an<00:00:21.600> A<00:00:22.500> Knight's<00:00:23.160> pawn<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:24.990> just

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
he has an A Knight's pawn so let's just

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800 
he has an A Knight's pawn so let's just
realize<00:00:25.710> why<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.730> makes<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.300> difference

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
realize why this makes a difference

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.919 
realize why this makes a difference
now<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:28.980> everything<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> shifted<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
now because everything is shifted to the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
now because everything is shifted to the
left<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:32.130> looking<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.880> blacks

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
left if we're looking from blacks

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.470 
left if we're looking from blacks
perspective<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.530> defenders<00:00:34.920> perspective<00:00:35.480> we

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
perspective the defenders perspective we

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
perspective the defenders perspective we
see<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:38.899> white<00:00:39.899> cannot<00:00:40.230> Alf<00:00:40.500> outflank<00:00:41.340> black

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
see that white cannot Alf outflank black

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.590 
see that white cannot Alf outflank black
since<00:00:42.540> rook<00:00:42.750> h7<00:00:43.379> does<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:44.040> threaten<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:45.030> check

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
since rook h7 does not threaten a check

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.310 
since rook h7 does not threaten a check
on<00:00:45.629> h8<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.719> King<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.899> F<00:00:49.110> 8

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
on h8 as it would if the King one F 8

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.180 
on h8 as it would if the King one F 8
and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> pawn<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.539> f5<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> point

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and the pawn on f5 so that's the point

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
and the pawn on f5 so that's the point
and<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.050> stay<00:00:55.260> passive

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and because of that we can stay passive

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
and because of that we can stay passive
now<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.699> seem<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.059> weird<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.449> in

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
now this might seem bit weird because in

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
now this might seem bit weird because in
reckonings<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.590> famously<00:00:59.160> said<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
reckonings it's famously said that you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
reckonings it's famously said that you
have<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> keep<00:01:00.449> active<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
have to keep active and you have to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.670 
have to keep active and you have to
attack<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.550> checks<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:04.019> lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> plate

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
attack with checks and a lot of plate

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
attack with checks and a lot of plate
well<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> stay<00:01:06.450> as<00:01:06.570> passive

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
well here I want you to stay as passive

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230 
well here I want you to stay as passive
as<00:01:07.320> possible<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.580> how<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> draw<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
as possible and that's how you draw the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
as possible and that's how you draw the
same<00:01:09.330> thing<00:01:09.920> obviously<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
same thing obviously we don't want to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
same thing obviously we don't want to
bring<00:01:11.670> our<00:01:11.850> work<00:01:12.060> off<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.840> rank<00:01:13.140> since

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
bring our work off the back rank since

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580 
bring our work off the back rank since
there<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> threat<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> checkmate<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.290> with

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there is a threat of checkmate so with

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
there is a threat of checkmate so with
we<00:01:16.920> keep<00:01:17.310> our<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.360> I'll<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.630> show

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we keep our up here and I'll just show

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
we keep our up here and I'll just show
you<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.590> white<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> play<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.700> might<00:01:20.909> try

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you if it's white to play you might try

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.410 
you if it's white to play you might try
rook<00:01:22.200> h7<00:01:22.799> well<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> does<00:01:23.640> nothing<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.270> we

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
rook h7 well that does nothing then we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
rook h7 well that does nothing then we
play<00:01:24.600> rook<00:01:24.750> a8<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> get

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
play rook a8 and if you want to get

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.260 
play rook a8 and if you want to get
active<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.439> sure<00:01:28.799> way<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> lose

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
active then that's a sure way to lose

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.480 
active then that's a sure way to lose
okay<00:01:30.270> six<00:01:30.750> check<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> thank<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> much<00:01:32.250> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
okay six check and thank you much you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.380 
okay six check and thank you much you
just<00:01:32.670> ruined<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:34.079> endgame<00:01:34.579> okay<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
just ruined a good endgame okay so you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.649 
just ruined a good endgame okay so you
can't<00:01:36.600> play<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:38.390> otherwise<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.540> has

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
can't play that and otherwise he has

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
can't play that and otherwise he has
nothing<00:01:39.930> better<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.439> retreat<00:01:40.970> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
nothing better to do then retreat so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
nothing better to do then retreat so
we're<00:01:42.570> turning<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
we're turning back to this kind of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.530 
we're turning back to this kind of
position<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:44.549> other<00:01:44.670> opportunities<00:01:45.119> are

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
position what other opportunities are

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.990 
position what other opportunities are
well

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
well

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.690 
well
after<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.119> pass<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.720> rook<00:01:48.930> c8<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:49.829> look<00:01:50.130> g7

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
after we pass with rook c8 then look g7

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
after we pass with rook c8 then look g7
check<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> decision

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
check and we have to make a decision

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160 
check and we have to make a decision
it's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> very<00:01:53.040> simple<00:01:53.520> decision<00:01:53.729> okay<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.930> want

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's a very simple decision okay we want

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
it's a very simple decision okay we want
to<00:01:55.320> stay<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> corner

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to stay to the corner

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.990 
to stay to the corner
this<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.149> crucial<00:01:57.420> I'll<00:01:58.170> highlight<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
this is crucial I'll highlight that

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840 
this is crucial I'll highlight that
point<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:01.219> this<00:02:02.219> doesn't<00:02:02.520> help

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
point is that now this doesn't help

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.310 
point is that now this doesn't help
white<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.759> with<00:02:05.759> our<00:02:05.880> King<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> corner

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
white so with our King on in the corner

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.949 
white so with our King on in the corner
white<00:02:07.950> cannot<00:02:08.280> outflank<00:02:08.970> us<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.780> why

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
white cannot outflank us and that's why

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
white cannot outflank us and that's why
the<00:02:10.020> passive<00:02:10.649> defense<00:02:10.950> as

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the passive defense as

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
the passive defense as
we<00:02:11.970> called<00:02:12.500> works<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> passive

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
we called works this is a passive
