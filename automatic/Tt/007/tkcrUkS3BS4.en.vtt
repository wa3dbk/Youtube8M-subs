00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.100 
it has arisen wristband
personally<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> prefer<00:01:23.520> metal<00:01:24.330> wristbands<00:01:24.810> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
personally I prefer metal wristbands but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.830 
personally I prefer metal wristbands but
this<00:01:25.680> watch<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.670> water<00:01:27.030> resistant<00:01:27.600> for

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840

this watch is also water resistant for
diving

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
diving

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
diving
I<00:01:28.380> think<00:01:28.920> resin<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.600> best<00:01:30.810> solution<00:01:30.930> for

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I think resin is the best solution for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
I think resin is the best solution for
that<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> told<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> 200<00:01:33.479> meters<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.380> 20

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that so as I told you 200 meters or 20

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
that so as I told you 200 meters or 20
bars<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:36.090> resistant<00:01:37.280> shock<00:01:38.280> resistant<00:01:39.079> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
bars water resistant shock resistant so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.649 
bars water resistant shock resistant so
you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.159> protection

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
you can see it has a little protection

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.190 
you can see it has a little protection
above<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.229> display<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> falls

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
above the display so when it falls

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.510 
above the display so when it falls
doesn't<00:01:46.200> usually<00:01:46.439> fall<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.579> display<00:01:49.520> over

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.080 

and<00:06:16.420> your<00:06:16.960> phone<00:06:17.350> will<00:06:17.710> make<00:06:18.010> a<00:06:18.090> really

somewhere in your apartment a really

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.020 
somewhere in your apartment a really
nice<00:06:24.400> feature<00:06:24.670> and<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.630> tested<00:06:25.840> it<00:06:26.080> out<00:06:26.200> it<00:06:27.030> the

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
nice feature and I tested it out it the

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.940 
nice feature and I tested it out it the
distance<00:06:28.360> is<00:06:29.280> like<00:06:30.280> what<00:06:30.730> 10<00:06:31.150> 10<00:06:32.140> meters<00:06:32.560> or

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
distance is like what 10 10 meters or

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.750 
distance is like what 10 10 meters or
more<00:06:33.340> is<00:06:34.180> no<00:06:34.480> problem<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.170> I<00:06:35.650> think<00:06:35.770> usually

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
more is no problem so I think usually

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.900 
more is no problem so I think usually
you<00:06:37.090> don't<00:06:37.210> have<00:06:37.450> your<00:06:37.600> watch<00:06:38.020> more<00:06:38.980> than<00:06:39.190> 10
