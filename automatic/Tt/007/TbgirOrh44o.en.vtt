00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
rebuilding the windows whenever he tries

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
rebuilding the windows whenever he tries
to<00:00:52.590> break<00:00:52.770> them<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.730> left

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to break them so you all you have left

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
to break them so you all you have left
is<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.449> zombie<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.920> keep

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is this one zombie and if you don't keep

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.849 
is this one zombie and if you don't keep
this<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.550> zombie<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.289> you're<00:00:58.289> gonna<00:00:58.649> be

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this one zombie then you're gonna be

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.459 
this one zombie then you're gonna be
screwed<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.520> you're<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.120> have

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
screwed because you're gonna have

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
screwed because you're gonna have
probably<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.620> wave<00:01:02.100> 5<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.699> 6<00:01:03.030> just

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
probably a little wave 5 or 6 just

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
probably a little wave 5 or 6 just
coming<00:01:04.350> straight<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.860> full<00:01:05.070> force<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
coming straight at you full force and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
coming straight at you full force and
all<00:01:05.850> alone<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.840> much<00:01:07.020> gonna<00:01:07.170> be

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
all alone it's pretty much gonna be

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
all alone it's pretty much gonna be
impossible<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> way<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
impossible and by the way this is a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
impossible and by the way this is a
Solent<00:01:09.659> invincibility<00:01:10.470> glitch<00:01:10.680> glitch<00:01:11.490> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
Solent invincibility glitch glitch you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.160 
Solent invincibility glitch glitch you
can't<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.330> two<00:01:12.360> people<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.930> tried

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
can't do it with two people have tried

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.890 
can't do it with two people have tried
it<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.630> keep

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it and here you are so you're gonna keep

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
it and here you are so you're gonna keep
going<00:01:16.140> until<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> stop<00:01:17.220> number<00:01:17.549> 3<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
going until you get to stop number 3 so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
going until you get to stop number 3 so
once<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> bus<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.900> stopped<00:01:19.110> three<00:01:19.439> times

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
once the bus is stopped three times

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
once the bus is stopped three times
that's<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.220> you're<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.430> want<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.790> off

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's when you're gonna want to get off

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.780 
that's when you're gonna want to get off
so<00:01:21.740> you're<00:01:22.740> gonna<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.610> more

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so you're gonna see here a little more

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420 
so you're gonna see here a little more
of<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.390> barricading<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> doors<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of me barricading up the doors but this

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
of me barricading up the doors but this
makes<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.030> easier<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> leave<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
makes it a lot easier if you leave a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
makes it a lot easier if you leave a
straggler<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.430> might<00:01:29.579> even<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:30.000> easier

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
straggler and it might even be easier

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810 
straggler and it might even be easier
than<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> crawler<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.549> I

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
than that if you use the crawler but I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.450 
than that if you use the crawler but I
just<00:01:33.570> use<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.900> guy<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> back

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
just use this guy and just kind of back

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
just use this guy and just kind of back
off<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.909> he<00:01:36.030> hits<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.659> rebuild<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> all

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
off as he hits you and rebuild it all

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
off as he hits you and rebuild it all
the<00:01:37.770> way<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.509> coming<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.350> stop

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the way and we are coming up on stop

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.260 
the way and we are coming up on stop
number<00:01:40.979> three<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.670> soon

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
number three here pretty soon

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
number three here pretty soon
and<00:01:43.110> you'll<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> second<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and you'll see that here in a second and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.380 
and you'll see that here in a second and
then<00:01:47.310> I'll<00:01:47.430> start<00:01:47.610> guiding<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> through<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then I'll start guiding you through the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
then I'll start guiding you through the
actual<00:01:48.750> part<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> glitch<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
actual part of the glitch but this is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
actual part of the glitch but this is
just<00:01:50.430> getting<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.299> takes<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:51.630> five

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
just getting into it it takes about five

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.780 
just getting into it it takes about five
minutes<00:01:52.259> probably<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.280> started

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
minutes probably to get this started

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
minutes probably to get this started
and<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.740> wave<00:01:56.219> too

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and all you have to get on this wave too

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880 
and all you have to get on this wave too
so<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.420> also<00:01:57.570> takes<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> couple

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so that also takes it you know a couple

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
so that also takes it you know a couple
minutes<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.490> you're<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> bus

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
minutes so you're gonna get off the bus

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
minutes so you're gonna get off the bus
you're<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.259> run<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.680> direction<00:02:02.219> you're

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you're gonna run this direction you're

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.830 
you're gonna run this direction you're
gonna<00:02:02.460> run<00:02:02.759> over<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> shed<00:02:03.630> you're

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
gonna run over here to the shed you're

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.889 
gonna run over here to the shed you're
gonna<00:02:03.960> open<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.320> door<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.780> you're

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
gonna open that door and then you're

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.469 
gonna open that door and then you're
just<00:02:07.020> gonna<00:02:07.170> hop<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.590> down<00:02:07.829> into<00:02:08.160> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
just gonna hop on down into this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.969 
just gonna hop on down into this
it's<00:02:08.720> kind<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.020> a<00:02:09.080> medical<00:02:09.530> room<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's kind of like a medical room and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.979 
it's kind of like a medical room and
once<00:02:10.580> here<00:02:10.759> you're<00:02:10.910> gonna<00:02:11.030> try<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> find<00:02:11.840> a

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
once here you're gonna try to find a

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.130 
once here you're gonna try to find a
part<00:02:12.489> it's<00:02:13.489> not<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.060> first<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:14.629> I<00:02:14.660> pick<00:02:14.930> up

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
part it's not this first when I pick up

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.050 
part it's not this first when I pick up
but<00:02:15.379> it's<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.620> second<00:02:16.069> one<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.849> will

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
but it's the second one but you will

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.610 
but it's the second one but you will
need<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.390> first<00:02:17.660> part<00:02:18.050> if<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.000> plan<00:02:20.000> on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
need this first part if you plan on

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.070 
need this first part if you plan on
turning<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.860> electricity<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.760> place

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
turning on the electricity in this place

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.910 
turning on the electricity in this place
so<00:02:25.060> I'm<00:02:26.060> gonna<00:02:26.209> show<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.569> it's<00:02:27.110> always<00:02:27.380> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
so I'm gonna show you it's always it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.620 
so I'm gonna show you it's always it
kind<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.250> varies<00:02:28.430> wherever<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> parts<00:02:29.450> are

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
kind of varies wherever the parts are

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.620 
kind of varies wherever the parts are
but<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.920> first<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.400> was<00:02:31.519> right<00:02:31.700> there<00:02:32.030> it's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
but that first one was right there it's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.020 
but that first one was right there it's
usually<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.200> near<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> entrance<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:34.400> mine

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
usually right near the entrance but mine

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.120 
usually right near the entrance but mine
was<00:02:35.239> randomly<00:02:35.630> right<00:02:35.930> here<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.590> that's<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
was randomly right here so that's the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.190 
was randomly right here so that's the
part<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.459> need<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.360> do<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.690> invincibility

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
part you need to do this invincibility

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.960 
part you need to do this invincibility
glitch<00:02:39.410> once<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.310> find<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.700> gonna<00:02:40.790> come

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
glitch once you find that you gonna come

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820 
glitch once you find that you gonna come
over<00:02:41.209> here<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.660> install<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.530> this

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
over here and install it on this

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.370 
over here and install it on this
workbench<00:02:43.420> then<00:02:44.420> once<00:02:44.630> there<00:02:44.900> it'll<00:02:45.080> pop<00:02:45.349> up

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
workbench then once there it'll pop up

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
workbench then once there it'll pop up
right<00:02:45.739> here<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.910> just<00:02:46.940> crouch<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> get

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
right here and you just crouch and get

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.660 
right here and you just crouch and get
inside<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.530> push<00:02:48.739> yourself<00:02:49.280> all<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.640> way

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
inside of here push yourself all the way

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.020 
inside of here push yourself all the way
back<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.269> once<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:51.140> you're<00:02:51.319> invincible

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
back and once in here you're invincible

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.309 
back and once in here you're invincible
no<00:02:53.030> zombies<00:02:53.480> can<00:02:53.660> touch<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.049> they'll<00:02:54.230> all

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
no zombies can touch you they'll all

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.080 
no zombies can touch you they'll all
just<00:02:54.560> pile<00:02:54.799> up<00:02:55.069> as<00:02:55.250> I'll<00:02:55.400> show<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:55.940> a

just pile up as I'll show you here in a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.370 
just pile up as I'll show you here in a
second<00:02:57.970> I'm<00:02:58.970> gonna<00:02:59.120> speed<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.599> there's<00:03:00.260> a

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
second I'm gonna speed that there's a

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.680 
second I'm gonna speed that there's a
random<00:03:00.590> creepy<00:03:00.920> arm<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.400> mine<00:03:01.610> but<00:03:01.910> that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
random creepy arm in mine but that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.080 
random creepy arm in mine but that
probably<00:03:02.930> won't<00:03:03.049> be<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.260> everybody's<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.090> you

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
probably won't be in everybody's and you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.150 
probably won't be in everybody's and you
can<00:03:05.239> just<00:03:05.450> easily<00:03:05.840> headshot<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.650> I'll<00:03:06.890> show

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
can just easily headshot and I'll show

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.100 
can just easily headshot and I'll show
you<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:08.030> kind<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.269> line<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.660> up<00:03:08.750> here<00:03:08.810> in

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
you them just kind of line it up here in

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.809 
you them just kind of line it up here in
a<00:03:09.170> second<00:03:09.530> after<00:03:09.769> this<00:03:09.920> all<00:03:10.069> speeds<00:03:10.370> up<00:03:10.579> real

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
a second after this all speeds up real

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.289 
a second after this all speeds up real
quick<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:12.500> they'll<00:03:13.130> just<00:03:13.160> start<00:03:13.579> piling<00:03:13.880> in

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
quick and they'll just start piling in

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.360 
quick and they'll just start piling in
and<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:15.410> really<00:03:15.680> easy<00:03:15.769> they<00:03:16.040> actually

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
and it's really easy they actually

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.710 
and it's really easy they actually
killed<00:03:16.639> themselves<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.269> don't<00:03:17.389> actually

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
killed themselves you don't actually

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.520 
killed themselves you don't actually
need<00:03:18.049> ammo

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
need ammo

neat you don't necessarily have to
reload<00:03:27.380> ammo<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.799> every<00:03:28.040> room<00:03:28.220> which<00:03:29.060> is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
reload ammo on every room which is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.240 
reload ammo on every room which is
pretty<00:03:29.389> sweet<00:03:29.680> as<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.829> can<00:03:30.950> see<00:03:31.069> they're<00:03:31.220> just
