 i 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.540
 for the dough we are going to need water 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.559
 olive oil dry yeast 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.170
 bakery salt white wheat flour and 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.270
 whole wheat flour in a bowl 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.270
 we mix the flours with the salt 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.250
 we add the yeast and we go back to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250
 Mix 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.010

 mix with a baker's squeegee 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.750
 or a spatula until the flour has 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.750
 absorbed all the liquid 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.840
 we cover the bowl with a plastic and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.840
 let stand for 20 minutes 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 we put some oil on the table 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.970
 of work and overturned the dough 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.909
 we knead for 1 minute and go back to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.789
 put the dough in the bowl 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.939
 cover and let stand for 15 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.939
 minutes 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.210
 we seek again our mass on the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.150
 work surface and knead for 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.760
 one minute 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.130
 we will repeat several mass cycles two 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.770
 shorts and rest until our mass 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.690
 have a smooth and shiny surface a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.180
 moment in which we put it in the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.410
 bowl we cover it and let it ferment 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.410
 until I double its volume 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 The ingredients for the filling are 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 seitan soy sauce tomato sauce 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.810
 parsley mushrooms cheese grated 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.239
 onion garlic cloves and spinach 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 first peel and chop 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.440
 finely the garlic 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.960
 one 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.330
 we do the same onion 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.430
 We are both ingredients in a pan 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.430
 with some olive oil 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.830
 while the onion softens we cut 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.830
 the seitan in medium pieces 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.370
 We also cut the mushrooms in 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.370
 chunks 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.950
 when the onion is tender we add 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 the seitan to the pan we cook during 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.660
 a few minutes and we add the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.880
 mushrooms 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.040
 while the mushrooms soften 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 chop the spinach leaves 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.640
 we also chop the parsley 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.000
 when the mushrooms are softened 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.590
 we add the tomato sauce mix and 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.590
 we also add the spinach 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.159
 when the spinach is tender 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.140
 add to the pan the soy sauce and 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.630
 Chopped parsley 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.710
 we cook for two or three minutes and 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.710
 we turn away from the fire 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.370
 Hello 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.470
 once the dough has doubled its 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.870
 volume we dump it on the table 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.200
 lightly floured work and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.379
 we form a rectangle of about 40 x 30 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.379
 centimeters 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 good 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.500
 Y 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.800
 once we have stretched with the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.870
 roll the dough we fold and put 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.870
 under a sheet of vegetable paper 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.590
 we need the dough with tomato sauce 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.770
 we distribute the filling over without 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.770
 get to the edges 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.850
 finally we spread some cheese 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.220
 shredded the dough putting the 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.160
 side a little towards the center and with 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.960
 the help of the vegetable paper sheet 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.880
 we started to roll up the inflamos with 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.060
 water the top edge so that our 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.040
 dough seal better 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.030
 we cover the dough with a cloth and the 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.920
 let stand for 30 minutes 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.140
 i 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.460
 We put the dough in the oven and bake 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.170
 at 200 degrees for 40 minutes we take out 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.180
 the mass of the oven and let it cool 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.090
 a little 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.090
 we serve it cut into thick slices
