 the curricula they were based on

 the methodology used in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.070
 our materials only through 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 methodologies because we believe 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
 that through it we speak from the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 period the first period it has 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.010
 contact with the professional experience 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.530
 which will allow him to have a training 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.290
 closer to the practice he needs 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.360
 also here 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.190
 So who does methodology mean? 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.930
 there was soon in the first period we 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 we work with case studies 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.240
 where he works with successful cases 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.880
 in the real world and with that he starts to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.280
 study the contents that are within the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.530
 our learning teaching material 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 evaluation system it occurs during 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.800
 the whole course and have activities 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 through the platform 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.530
 through learning objects and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.900
 also in face- to- face meetings 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.140
 that it can consolidate all the material 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.360
 that he studied throughout the discipline to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.250
 the pursuit of higher education requires 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 student in their professional training 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.270
 when the student is applying for a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.310
 vestibular when he passes once 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.210
 late what he seeks his way so 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.220
 professional 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.680
 on this concern as 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.680
 to develop skills not only the

 content given by the books in class 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.020
 teachers at the doors competence 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.090
 while the professional must have to 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.850
 then to enter the market of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.370
 work or improve their position at the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.980
 our focus is not only on training for 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.750
 get a job but to improve the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.000
 condition that he has today who knows 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.980
 still if the entrepreneur in your area 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.160
 in this work since the first period 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.230
 teachers and tutors are evaluating 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 the skills he already smells 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.670
 because the student is not a board sometimes 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 already brings with them an experience they 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.960
 they map these skills and will 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.880
 developing over the periods 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.730
 what others does he need to develop? 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.440
