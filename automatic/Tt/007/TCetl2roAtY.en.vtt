that I received from RPGSHOW NS 0 0 4 s
so<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.469> picked<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.219> week<00:00:14.460> out<00:00:14.670> myself<00:00:15.230> because

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
so I picked this week out myself because

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
so I picked this week out myself because
I'm<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> biggest<00:00:17.760> fan<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.090> blonde

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
I'm not the biggest fan of blonde

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
I'm not the biggest fan of blonde
directly<00:00:20.250> against<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.850> skin<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> one

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
directly against my skin but this one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.650 
directly against my skin but this one
the<00:00:22.500> ombre<00:00:22.920> starts<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.699> far<00:00:24.150> down<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the ombre starts so far down that I

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900 
the ombre starts so far down that I
thought<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.890> black<00:00:26.130> would<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.400> close<00:00:26.699> enough

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
thought the black would be close enough

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.419 
thought the black would be close enough
to<00:00:27.180> my<00:00:27.269> face<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.840> still<00:00:28.050> flatter<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.710> still<00:00:29.130> be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to my face to still flatter and still be

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
to my face to still flatter and still be
able<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> pop<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.599> color<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
able to get that pop of color on the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
able to get that pop of color on the
ends<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.070> worked<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
ends which I think worked out well this

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.250 
ends which I think worked out well this
is<00:00:33.780> pretty<00:00:34.200> much<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> box<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.300> cut

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
is pretty much right out the box I cut

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.580 
is pretty much right out the box I cut
the<00:00:37.380> lights<00:00:37.559> off<00:00:37.770> put<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.879> no<00:00:39.780> tweezing<00:00:40.200> up

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the lights off put it on no tweezing up

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.360 
the lights off put it on no tweezing up
the<00:00:40.829> part<00:00:41.129> no<00:00:41.790> concealer<00:00:42.600> no<00:00:43.500> curls<00:00:44.010> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the part no concealer no curls it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
the part no concealer no curls it's
pretty<00:00:44.789> much<00:00:45.000> put<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.879> usually<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
pretty much put on go I usually like to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080 
pretty much put on go I usually like to
experiment<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.230> how<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> units<00:00:50.250> look<00:00:50.460> curled

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
experiment on how the units look curled

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
experiment on how the units look curled
but<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> straight

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but this one I really like the straight

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
but this one I really like the straight
sleek<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.940> all<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> did<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.829> rid

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
sleek look so all I did was just get rid

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
sleek look so all I did was just get rid
of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.340> kink<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> there
