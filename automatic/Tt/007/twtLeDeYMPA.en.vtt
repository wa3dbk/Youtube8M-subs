this<00:00:00.539> is<00:00:00.690> one<00:00:00.840> of<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:00.960> few<00:00:01.140> architecture

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is one of the few architecture

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.849 
this is one of the few architecture
programs<00:00:02.570> maybe<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.899> it's<00:00:04.410> really<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.799> only

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
programs maybe the it's really the only

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.849 
programs maybe the it's really the only
one<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.339> we<00:00:05.460> know<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.700> actually<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:07.080> we

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
one that we know of actually that we

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.950 
one that we know of actually that we
teach<00:00:08.519> architecture<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> Upper<00:00:09.840> School

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
teach architecture in the Upper School

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320 
teach architecture in the Upper School
for<00:00:10.290> four<00:00:10.349> years<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.250> starts<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.179> middle

for four years it starts in the middle

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.620 
for four years it starts in the middle
school<00:00:12.690> however<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.849> when<00:00:14.849> students<00:00:15.299> come<00:00:15.450> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
school however and when students come in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.920 
school however and when students come in
here<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.619> trying<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> get<00:00:17.279> them<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.930> think

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
here we are trying to get them to think

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.230 
here we are trying to get them to think
outside<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.590> box<00:00:19.859> we're<00:00:20.400> trying<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.000> them

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
outside the box we're trying to get them

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.769 
outside the box we're trying to get them
to<00:00:21.810> take<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> our<00:00:23.180> assignments<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
to take one of our assignments when the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.710 
to take one of our assignments when the
problems<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> solve<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:27.300> first

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
problems to solve and it I'm first

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
problems to solve and it I'm first
looking<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.560> might<00:00:28.920> look<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
looking at it it might look like the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
looking at it it might look like the
simplest<00:00:30.330> idea

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
simplest idea

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.069 
simplest idea
the<00:00:32.009> simplest<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.940> boxes<00:00:33.420> merging<00:00:33.930> together

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the simplest two boxes merging together

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
the simplest two boxes merging together
but<00:00:34.950> how<00:00:35.130> might<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.670> take<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.239> problem

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
but how might they take that problem

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
but how might they take that problem
make<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.770> piece<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> paper<00:00:38.280> how

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
make it out of one piece of paper how

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.630 
make it out of one piece of paper how
might<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.239> glue<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.750> together<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> it's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
might they glue it together so that it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
might they glue it together so that it's
beautifully<00:00:42.360> crafted<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> speaks<00:00:43.800> loud

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
beautifully crafted so it speaks loud

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.940 
beautifully crafted so it speaks loud
and<00:00:44.610> clear<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> ideas<00:00:46.200> behind<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
and clear but the ideas behind that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
and clear but the ideas behind that
piece<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.300> take<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.750> deceptively<00:00:49.320> simple

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
piece and to take a deceptively simple

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
piece and to take a deceptively simple
object<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.539> come<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
object and and come up with that as the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.680 
object and and come up with that as the
final<00:00:54.000> piece<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:55.379> kid<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.399> always<00:00:56.760> proud<00:00:57.480> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
final piece that kid is always proud of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
final piece that kid is always proud of
it<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.710> they<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it you know they look at that and and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
it you know they look at that and and
people<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
people will see it and think well it's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
people will see it and think well it's
beautiful<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.600> simple<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.769> here's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
beautiful it's so simple but here's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.510 
beautiful it's so simple but here's
where<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.400> came<00:01:05.610> from

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
where it came from

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.490 
where it came from
those<00:01:07.060> they'll<00:01:07.509> take<00:01:07.689> one<00:01:07.960> piece<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.350> paper

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
those they'll take one piece of paper

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.980 
those they'll take one piece of paper
and<00:01:08.860> fold<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.250> out<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.090> was<00:01:10.149> made<00:01:10.420> from<00:01:10.720> one

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
and fold it out and it was made from one

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.289 
and fold it out and it was made from one
piece<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.619> they<00:01:12.189> had<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.520> think<00:01:12.759> through<00:01:13.149> this

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
piece and they had to think through this

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:25.550 
piece and they had to think through this
elaborate<00:01:13.960> thing<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.439> get<00:01:14.590> there

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.539 

many<00:01:26.560> times<00:01:26.830> when<00:01:26.979> I<00:01:27.009> give<00:01:27.220> an<00:01:27.310> assignment

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
many times when I give an assignment

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.820 
many times when I give an assignment
I'll<00:01:28.180> say<00:01:28.450> make<00:01:28.720> sure<00:01:29.049> you're<00:01:29.320> not<00:01:29.470> just

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
I'll say make sure you're not just

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.880 
I'll say make sure you're not just
simply<00:01:30.250> answering<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.970> question<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.560> you're

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
simply answering the question but you're

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.940 
simply answering the question but you're
taking<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> point<00:01:35.020> where<00:01:35.259> people<00:01:35.289> are

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
taking it to the point where people are

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.850 
taking it to the point where people are
want<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> look<00:01:37.240> at<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.600> want<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:37.960> hold<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.500> it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
want to look at it want to hold on to it

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520 
want to look at it want to hold on to it
for<00:01:39.100> more<00:01:39.310> than<00:01:39.549> just<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.970> glance<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.350> that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
for more than just a glance and so that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.410 
for more than just a glance and so that
comes<00:01:41.830> from<00:01:42.039> inside<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.820> comes<00:01:43.030> from<00:01:43.210> you

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
comes from inside that comes from you

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.539 
comes from inside that comes from you
really<00:01:44.049> preparing<00:01:44.470> yourself<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.220> really

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
really preparing yourself and really

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.660 
really preparing yourself and really
thinking<00:01:46.030> through<00:01:46.270> an<00:01:46.450> idea<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:48.369> all

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
thinking through an idea and that's all

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.540 
thinking through an idea and that's all
with<00:01:48.939> that<00:01:49.149> process<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:50.080> begin<00:01:50.380> with<00:01:50.590> about

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
with that process to begin with about

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.499 
with that process to begin with about
great<00:01:51.909> preparation<00:01:52.630> great<00:01:52.929> research<00:01:54.509> we

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
great preparation great research we

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.289 
great preparation great research we
produce<00:01:56.170> work<00:01:56.500> here<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:57.130> easily<00:01:57.970> can<00:01:58.270> be

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
produce work here that easily can be

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.450 
produce work here that easily can be
compared<00:01:59.020> on<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.259> college<00:01:59.619> level<00:01:59.830> this<00:02:00.399> is

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
you have a pretty good clear thought

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.450 
you have a pretty good clear thought
about<00:03:33.130> it

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
about it

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.200 
about it
so<00:03:34.060> with<00:03:34.660> starting<00:03:35.200> with<00:03:35.320> mine

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
so with starting with mine

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.410 
so with starting with mine
a<00:03:36.300> foundation<00:03:37.110> course<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:38.400> starts<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:39.210> away

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
a foundation course it starts right away

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.890 
a foundation course it starts right away
with<00:03:40.410> as<00:03:40.800> they<00:03:41.190> construct<00:03:41.700> something<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
with as they construct something for a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.120 
with as they construct something for a
final<00:03:43.260> project<00:03:43.650> I'll<00:03:44.130> say<00:03:45.680> don't<00:03:46.680> show<00:03:46.770> me<00:03:47.010> any

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
final project I'll say don't show me any

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.130 
final project I'll say don't show me any
pencil<00:03:47.520> mark<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.960> make<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
pencil mark you know if you make a

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.200 
pencil mark you know if you make a
mistake<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.740> cutting<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.610> do<00:03:50.790> it

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
mistake with the cutting we do it

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.420 
mistake with the cutting we do it
just<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.870> used<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
just get used to it this is this is the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.120 
just get used to it this is this is the
process<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.090> creating<00:03:54.770> when<00:03:55.770> you're<00:03:55.890> doing

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
process of creating when you're doing

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.440 
process of creating when you're doing
sketching<00:03:56.730> sketch<00:03:57.060> sketch<00:03:57.300> sketch<00:03:58.370> but

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
sketching sketch sketch sketch but

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.970 
sketching sketch sketch sketch but
you're<00:04:00.450> going<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.720> gradually<00:04:01.080> develop<00:04:01.860> that

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
you're going to gradually develop that

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.800 
you're going to gradually develop that
those<00:04:02.160> sketches<00:04:02.490> will<00:04:02.730> become<00:04:03.030> stronger<00:04:03.600> and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
those sketches will become stronger and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.250 
those sketches will become stronger and
stronger<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.620> then<00:04:05.580> we<00:04:06.540> hold<00:04:07.020> them<00:04:07.140> up

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
stronger and then we hold them up

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.680 
stronger and then we hold them up
together<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.940> I'll<00:04:09.030> place<00:04:09.480> them

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
together and you know I'll place them

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.540 
together and you know I'll place them
out<00:04:09.810> there<00:04:10.020> in<00:04:10.260> front<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.950> I'll<00:04:11.430> go

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
out there in front of them and I'll go

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.110 
out there in front of them and I'll go
which<00:04:12.000> one<00:04:12.240> speaks<00:04:12.600> clearly<00:04:13.820> they<00:04:14.820> know<00:04:14.970> what
