so<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.459> program<00:02:28.440> you're<00:02:29.440> saying<00:02:29.800> Sonny

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so this program you're saying Sonny

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.880 
so this program you're saying Sonny
wrote<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.959> actually<00:02:31.959> only<00:02:32.080> about<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.440> third<00:02:32.709> of

wrote it actually only about a third of
it<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.099> her<00:02:33.310> work<00:02:36.420> Naomi<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.569> working<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.020> a

Sonny Sonny went fishing in my library
to<00:02:48.340> see<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.580> there<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.880> any<00:02:49.060> source<00:02:49.420> code<00:02:49.750> she

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
to see if there was any source code she

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.390 
to see if there was any source code she
could<00:02:50.170> use<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.530> complete<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:52.650> eventually<00:02:53.650> she

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
could use to complete it eventually she

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:14.920 
could use to complete it eventually she
found<00:02:54.430> some<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:58.390> was<00:02:58.630> Emma's<00:02:59.170> worm<00:02:59.590> cluster

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.020 

she<00:03:15.930> took<00:03:16.109> my<00:03:16.349> sisters<00:03:16.890> code<00:03:17.189> and<00:03:17.549> worked<00:03:17.819> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
she took my sisters code and worked it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.750 
she took my sisters code and worked it
into<00:03:18.239> Naomi's<00:03:18.870> program<00:03:19.379> I<00:03:22.370> didn't<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.549> time

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
into Naomi's program I didn't have time

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.720 
into Naomi's program I didn't have time
to<00:03:23.939> look<00:03:24.090> over<00:03:24.209> every<00:03:24.689> single<00:03:24.900> line<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.319> code

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
to look over every single line of code

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.780 
to look over every single line of code
but<00:03:27.420> what<00:03:27.569> I<00:03:27.599> did<00:03:27.930> see<00:03:28.970> reminded<00:03:29.970> me<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> Emma
