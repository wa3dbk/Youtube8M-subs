00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
under pressure and we need a little

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.920 
under pressure and we need a little

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
break if we get the break then hopefully

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050

you<00:02:54.989> can<00:02:55.110> tend<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:56.040> defeat<00:02:56.370> into<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.730> drawer<00:02:57.030> and

you can tend to defeat into a drawer and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.229 
you can tend to defeat into a drawer and
then<00:02:57.360> maybe<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> winds<00:02:57.959> will<00:02:58.230> come<00:02:58.380> from<00:02:58.500> them

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
there and I'm sure they'll be fine I

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.000 
there and I'm sure they'll be fine I
suppose<00:04:46.840> clubs<00:04:47.080> down<00:04:47.290> there<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:47.830> know<00:04:47.950> you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
suppose clubs down there you know you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.340 
suppose clubs down there you know you
see<00:04:48.310> Ronnie<00:04:49.090> going<00:04:49.389> in<00:04:49.479> there<00:04:49.660> Gary<00:04:49.930> going<00:04:50.169> in

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
see Ronnie going in there Gary going in

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.050 
see Ronnie going in there Gary going in
at<00:04:50.440> Yeovil<00:04:50.770> pulling<00:04:51.010> them<00:04:51.130> clear<00:04:51.370> makes<00:04:51.940> it

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
at Yeovil pulling them clear makes it

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.129 
at Yeovil pulling them clear makes it
more<00:04:52.090> difficult<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.540> sniff<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.840> pic<00:04:53.050> of

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
more difficult to sniff a pic of

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.409 
more difficult to sniff a pic of
remaining<00:04:53.410> clubs<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:54.220> does<00:04:54.460> but<00:04:54.490> it's<00:04:54.910> you

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
remaining clubs it does but it's you

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.659 
remaining clubs it does but it's you
know<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:55.540> think<00:04:56.260> it<00:04:56.530> will<00:04:56.590> give<00:04:56.770> them<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.610> looks

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
know I think it will give them it looks

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:58.980 
know I think it will give them it looks
as<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.120> gives<00:04:58.270> him<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.479> little<00:04:58.630> bit<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.900> a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
as if it gives him a little bit of a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.050 
as if it gives him a little bit of a
bounce<00:04:59.200> there<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.680> but<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.370> know<00:05:00.580> once<00:05:00.729> once

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
bounce there and but you know once once

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.310 
bounce there and but you know once once
you've<00:05:01.180> got<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.360> momentum<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:02.169> that's

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
you've got that momentum I think that's

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.020 
you've got that momentum I think that's
a<00:05:02.440> huge<00:05:02.979> thing<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.400> football<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.789> my

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
a huge thing in football is my

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.430 
a huge thing in football is my
management<00:05:04.300> once<00:05:04.570> you've<00:05:04.720> got<00:05:04.930> that<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.260> just

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
management once you've got that you just

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.290 
management once you've got that you just
tend<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.889> just<00:05:06.039> keep<00:05:06.250> going<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.820> go<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.210> go

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
tend to just keep going and go in and go

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.700 
tend to just keep going and go in and go
in<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.539> you<00:05:07.840> know<00:05:07.930> Chum<00:05:08.169> you've<00:05:08.380> got<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.560> good

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
in and you know Chum you've got a good

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.409 
in and you know Chum you've got a good
start<00:05:09.039> all<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:09.970> keep<00:05:10.150> showing

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
start all this that you keep showing

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.779 
start all this that you keep showing
about<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:11.139> about<00:05:11.919> over<00:05:12.190> they've<00:05:12.340> got<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.610> play

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
about it about over they've got to play

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.279 
about it about over they've got to play
I<00:05:12.820> think<00:05:13.150> doesn't<00:05:13.389> make<00:05:13.690> any<00:05:13.990> difference

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
I think doesn't make any difference

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.219 
I think doesn't make any difference
whatsoever<00:05:15.010> is<00:05:15.639> it's<00:05:16.180> just<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.510> factors<00:05:17.020> like

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
whatsoever is it's just the factors like

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.290 
whatsoever is it's just the factors like
this<00:05:17.830> stage<00:05:18.130> of<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.310> season<00:05:18.400> will<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
this stage of the season will have the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.879 
this stage of the season will have the
biggest<00:05:19.479> impact<00:05:19.720> not<00:05:20.139> oh<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.350> actually<00:05:20.470> play

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
biggest impact not oh you actually play

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.770 
biggest impact not oh you actually play

tend to be like you know 6.6 pointers

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.790 
tend to be like you know 6.6 pointers
but<00:05:37.539> it's<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:38.139> know<00:05:38.169> just<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.530> fact<00:05:38.740> that

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
isn't gonna make it an easy game it's in

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.620 
isn't gonna make it an easy game it's in
fact<00:05:42.460> he<00:05:42.580> might<00:05:42.729> turn<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.030> around<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.270> make<00:05:43.419> it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
fact he might turn it around and make it

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.879 
fact he might turn it around and make it
doubly<00:05:44.229> hard<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:45.039> check<00:05:45.729> on<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.880> table<00:05:46.200> 16th<00:05:47.200> is

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
doubly hard a check on the table 16th is

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.129 
doubly hard a check on the table 16th is
where<00:05:48.160> Tranmere<00:05:48.610> arnout<00:05:49.000> rising<00:05:49.990> up<00:05:50.110> the
