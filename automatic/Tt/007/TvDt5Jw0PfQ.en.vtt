00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
actually soaks it up it really helps to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
actually soaks it up it really helps to
drive<00:01:57.719> moisture<00:01:58.289> into<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> hair<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
drive moisture into the hair and it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
drive moisture into the hair and it
doesn't<00:02:00.509> stay<00:02:01.109> even<00:02:01.590> though<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.799> heavy<00:02:02.039> on

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
doesn't stay even though it's heavy on

doesn't stay even though it's heavy on

of protective styling and I'm not going

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.290 
of protective styling and I'm not going
to<00:02:45.650> say<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.280> not<00:02:46.370> important<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.910> do<00:02:47.090> so

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
to say that it's not important to do so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.240 
to say that it's not important to do so
because<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.750> does<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.560> really<00:02:49.040> really

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
because it does really really really

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.330 
because it does really really really
really<00:02:49.400> does<00:02:49.850> help<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.690> retaining<00:02:51.560> length<00:02:51.950> but

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
really does help in retaining length but

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.490 
really does help in retaining length but
