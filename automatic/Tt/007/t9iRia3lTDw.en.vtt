so<00:00:00.599> by<00:00:00.750> design<00:00:01.140> flexing<00:00:02.060> that's<00:00:03.060> into<00:00:03.300> itself

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
so by design flexing that's into itself

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.300 
so by design flexing that's into itself
so<00:00:03.870> no<00:00:04.110> matter<00:00:04.259> how<00:00:04.410> long<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.830> need<00:00:05.009> it

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
so no matter how long you need it

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.730 
so no matter how long you need it
it<00:00:05.520> connects<00:00:06.270> together<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.960> can<00:00:07.319> be<00:00:07.529> run

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
it connects together and can be run

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.220 
it connects together and can be run
continuously<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:09.120> addition<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.139> can

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
continuously in addition to that it can

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.110 
continuously in addition to that it can
be<00:00:10.290> cut<00:00:10.590> any<00:00:10.920> place<00:00:11.190> along<00:00:11.460> its<00:00:11.639> length<00:00:11.849> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
be cut any place along its length and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.930 
be cut any place along its length and
the<00:00:12.630> cut<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.200> still<00:00:13.410> fit<00:00:13.620> into<00:00:13.940> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the cut in will still fit into the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
the cut in will still fit into the
female<00:00:15.269> end<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> pipe<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.949> bring

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
female end of the pipe so you can bring

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.980 
female end of the pipe so you can bring
it<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> exact<00:00:17.850> length<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.510> need<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
it to the exact length that you need and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260 
it to the exact length that you need and
the<00:00:19.140> excess<00:00:19.980> parts<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.400> still<00:00:20.550> usable<00:00:20.910> for

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the excess parts are still usable for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.870 
the excess parts are still usable for
other<00:00:21.359> projects<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.680> addition<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.250> we

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
other projects in addition to that we

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
other projects in addition to that we
made<00:00:24.060> sure<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.019> different<00:00:25.380> cuffs

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
made sure that the the different cuffs

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
made sure that the the different cuffs
and<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> different<00:00:26.279> features<00:00:26.430> had<00:00:26.990> outside

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and the different features had outside

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.689 
and the different features had outside
diameters<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.650> inside<00:00:28.980> diameters<00:00:29.490> and

diameters and inside diameters and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
diameters and inside diameters and
Barb's<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> other<00:00:30.900> features<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> they

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
Barb's and other features so that they

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.440 
Barb's and other features so that they
would<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.189> more<00:00:32.340> Universal<00:00:32.940> than<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
would be more Universal than the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
would be more Universal than the
standard<00:00:34.020> pipe<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:35.820> trying<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
standard pipe so if you're trying to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
standard pipe so if you're trying to
hook<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.270> something<00:00:36.780> that's<00:00:37.500> exists<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.219> a

pipe it also hooks on in addition to
that<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> number<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.820> other<00:00:53.940> things

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that there's a number of other things

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
that there's a number of other things
because<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> dimensions<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.649> chose

don't make against the universal nature
of<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> works<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> industry

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
of it works this is the industry

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
of it works this is the industry
standard<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.049> perfectly<00:01:10.409> good<00:01:10.470> part<00:01:10.890> so

long as you don't need any extra length

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
long as you don't need any extra length
and<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:14.100> satisfied<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> angle<00:01:15.210> we

and you're satisfied with that angle we

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.820 
and you're satisfied with that angle we
thought<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> could<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.799> step

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
thought we could take it one step

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.230 
thought we could take it one step
further<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:19.220> generally<00:01:20.220> speaking<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.030> pipe

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
further so generally speaking the pipe

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
further so generally speaking the pipe
that<00:01:21.420> you've<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.869> ground<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.439> your

that you've got in the ground and your
downspout<00:01:23.540> they<00:01:24.540> never<00:01:24.750> match<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.170> quite

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
downspout they never match up quite

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
downspout they never match up quite
right<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> Flex<00:01:26.490> drain<00:01:26.700> fittings<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
right with the Flex drain fittings you

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.260 
right with the Flex drain fittings you
could<00:01:27.869> jog<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.590> side<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> other

could jog to one side of the other

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.609 
could jog to one side of the other
conformed<00:01:30.270> any<00:01:30.420> angle<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.470> can

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
conformed any angle you need you can

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950 
conformed any angle you need you can
extend<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.220> contract<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> fits<00:01:33.780> a

it has the same cuff features that allow

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
it has the same cuff features that allow
it<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> fit<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> various<00:01:39.090> types<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> pipe

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it to fit the various types of pipe

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.990 
it to fit the various types of pipe
again<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.340> instance<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.820> worried

pipe perfect art fits right inside this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.660 
pipe perfect art fits right inside this
is<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> standard<00:01:49.229> three<00:01:49.979> by<00:01:50.100> four<00:01:50.159> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is for a standard three by four but

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
is for a standard three by four but
you'll<00:01:50.820> notice<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.210> also<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> curvature<00:01:51.930> to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
invented a tea that is also a why or
