00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 yes hello my dear 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.110
 Welcome here with me I am already 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 again today I want button and that 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.160
 I want to have a hook today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 streuselkuchen are doing just that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 weekend with it again a bit 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.619
 something to chew on and to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.350
 Now we have to be the first one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.590
 make yeast dough 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 and for that we need now as 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 first of all soft butter and that are 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.030
 the 20 grams so do not have much 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.030
 I 've already turned off 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.280
 30 grams of sugar 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.239
 then fresh yeast ten grams 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.890
 that is relatively little i have myself 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.450
 always such a slice I cut off 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.310
 but now do not know if that only 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.320
 ten grams are or do not see 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.150
 can or how well even though fit 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.940
 so it was just a very narrow one 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:35.670
 then we need a pinch 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:35.670
 salt then 50 grams of lukewarm milk flour 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 275 grams 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.930
 and an egg 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:18.760
 so should the exact and cash that one 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:23.890
 knead the dough on the minute so that is 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.840
 now our yeast dough into another 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.819
 decant bowl and then I put 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.489
 give them a warm place of it then 30 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.019
 minutes and in the meantime 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.310
 I'll be my springform bit 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.010
 grease and after 30 minutes the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.780
 yeast dough with floured hands easy 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.540
 Press a little bit into the springform 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.880
 I'll show you then and then do it 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.130
 we still have our sprinkles and racing 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.230
 so do my dear half 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.690
 hour is rum a yeast dough has nice 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.819
 i have been able to go in here 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.099
 the springform degree with the hands purely 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.950
 has pressed really great process 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.780
 let a great day hire who 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.239
 just go to the side and join in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.459
 ours continue to sprinkle like mine 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.040
 I did not need to feel the next one 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.600
 We do not need 100 first 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.420
 gram can the butter I've got it myself 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.540
 here already weighed in and important 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.400
 is just that the butter is cold then 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.400
 come 100 grams super 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.600
 125 grams of flour 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.480
 75 grams of ground hazelnuts I have 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.490
 this is a few sachets that would like 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.490
 I'll just empty it now 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.350
 if that's enough for a prisoner 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.350
 sachet here 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.970
 i need hate me and now i should 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:24.370
 we still water in half a tablespoon to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:30.910
 do times thumb I do not know whether it 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:32.170
 it would not have been enough to watch 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.090
 let the whole 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.460
 I do only once a half minute so 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.730
 30 seconds at level 4 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.490
 But I'll look in and see if 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.350
 it is already streusel or if you still 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.590
 a bit longer of being told 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.590
 got to 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.390
 so with me are still eight seconds 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:15.840
 If you look at it yourself it will look like 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:21.380
 looks good so we sprinkle 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.380
 Now just here about our about 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:46.380
 distribute the sprinkles a bit and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.380
 to see that 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.380
 a little closer 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.890
 if we have the sprinkles nice now 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.950
 have distributed 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.400
 then we should do it all again 15 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.930
 minutes to go and in the 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.510
 In the meantime, we can now 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.960
 heat our oven high and that 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.570
 to 200 degrees above bottom and if 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.180
 then it was then we can namely 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.460
 also stop our cake 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:26.990
 and that should then on the middle 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.990
 rail and bake for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.560
 I'll leave one here now 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.260
 quarter of an hour are then cometh 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.460
 in the oven so my life of the cake 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:43.580
 was with me for 20 minutes now 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.580
 oven and now tasted 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.380

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.900

 Never eaten so far so far 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:26.190
 I think the recipe was great 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.620
