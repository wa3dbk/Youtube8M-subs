00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.260 

as<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.630> can<00:03:39.720> see<00:03:39.900> that's<00:03:40.110> 140<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.000> very

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
as you can see that's 140 it's a very

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.740 
as you can see that's 140 it's a very
good<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.990> can<00:03:43.170> also<00:03:43.320> start<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.980> out<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:45.570> that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
good you can also start it out of that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.190 
good you can also start it out of that
throw<00:03:46.170> now<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:47.580> nearly<00:03:47.850> as<00:03:47.940> much<00:03:48.150> ap<00:03:48.570> but

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
throw now it's not nearly as much ap but

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.110 
throw now it's not nearly as much ap but
it's<00:03:49.350> definitely<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.860> different<00:03:50.190> way<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.340> going

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
it's definitely a different way of going

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.110

its inescapable as long as they're on a
flat<00:05:07.920> surface<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:09.000> can<00:05:09.600> be<00:05:09.780> things<00:05:10.500> they<00:05:10.650> can't

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
level one which wanted to kinda short

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.820 
level one which wanted to kinda short
jump<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:26.210> then<00:05:26.300> go<00:05:26.540> cancel<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:27.170> there's<00:05:27.650> no

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
jump and then go cancel it there's no

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.440 
jump and then go cancel it there's no
way<00:05:27.950> they<00:05:28.070> can<00:05:28.130> get<00:05:28.340> out<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.760> I<00:05:28.880> mean<00:05:29.150> I'm

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
way they can get out of it I mean I'm

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.060 
way they can get out of it I mean I'm
pretty<00:05:29.510> sure<00:05:29.840> they<00:05:29.960> can<00:05:30.260> they<00:05:30.830> try<00:05:31.040> hard

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
pretty sure they can they try hard

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.950 
pretty sure they can they try hard
enough<00:05:31.340> but<00:05:31.910> for<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.150> most<00:05:32.270> part<00:05:32.390> every<00:05:32.780> time

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
enough but for the most part every time

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.840 
enough but for the most part every time
I<00:05:33.080> do<00:05:33.140> it<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:33.860> pretty<00:05:34.070> effective<00:05:34.220> because

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
I do it it's pretty effective because

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.060 
I do it it's pretty effective because
nobody<00:05:35.390> expects<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:36.290> be<00:05:36.410> able<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.740> do<00:05:36.890> that

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
nobody expects you to be able to do that

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.720
