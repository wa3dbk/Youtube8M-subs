00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
fact they're actors but I was also a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940

up in sanctuaries or on animal compounds

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.700 
up in sanctuaries or on animal compounds
many<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.190> them<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.730> declawed<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.930> crippled<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
many of them are declawed and crippled I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680 
many of them are declawed and crippled I
would<00:00:44.129> ask<00:00:44.309> why<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.300> cats

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
would ask why are all these cats

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.319 
would ask why are all these cats
declawed<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.160> answer<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
declawed and the answer because it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
declawed and the answer because it
supposedly<00:00:49.230> makes<00:00:49.620> them<00:00:49.860> safer<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> work<00:00:50.520> with

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
supposedly makes them safer to work with

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479 
supposedly makes them safer to work with
this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> realized<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.309> there

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this is when I realized that if there

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.819 
this is when I realized that if there
were<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.730> many<00:00:53.789> big<00:00:54.329> cats<00:00:54.690> declawed<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
were this many big cats declawed and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
were this many big cats declawed and
crippled<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.239> had<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.629> millions

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
crippled then there had to be millions

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.560 
crippled then there had to be millions
of<00:00:58.680> domestic<00:00:59.219> cats<00:00:59.430> who<00:00:59.760> were<00:00:59.910> suffering<00:01:00.180> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
of domestic cats who were suffering in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
of domestic cats who were suffering in
the<00:01:00.719> same<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> forefront

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the same way it's not on the forefront

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.840 
the same way it's not on the forefront
of<00:01:06.240> animal<00:01:06.960> cruelty<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.220> such<00:01:08.610> an

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
of animal cruelty but it's such an

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
of animal cruelty but it's such an
injustice<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.080> fact<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.680> their

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
injustice in the fact that it's their

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
injustice in the fact that it's their
doctors<00:01:11.460> doing<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> lot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
doctors doing it to them it's a lot

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.760 
doctors doing it to them it's a lot
easier<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.670> kitty<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.210> they're<00:01:15.360> young

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
easier on your kitty when they're young

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.950 
easier on your kitty when they're young
that<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.580> equivalent<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.330> taking

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that would be the equivalent of taking

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.620 
that would be the equivalent of taking
these<00:01:19.110> cigar<00:01:19.650> cutters<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.509> slipping<00:01:21.509> my

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
these cigar cutters and slipping my

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
these cigar cutters and slipping my
finger<00:01:22.080> through<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.710> cutting<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.580> whole

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
finger through and cutting this whole

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.499 
finger through and cutting this whole
last<00:01:24.509> bone<00:01:25.020> off<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:27.180> worse

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
last bone off and it's even worse

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
last bone off and it's even worse
because<00:01:28.140> their<00:01:28.470> doctors<00:01:28.890> aren't<00:01:29.100> telling

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because their doctors aren't telling

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
because their doctors aren't telling
what<00:01:29.850> they're<00:01:30.060> doing<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.200> them
