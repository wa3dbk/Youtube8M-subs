00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:02.960
 Hello, this is a review of a new player 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.960
 in order to 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.930
 as well as Chinese friends but unfortunately 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.710
 not ratified therefore 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.619
 menu square 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.109
 so chicago its rest menu this 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 player if silicate is largely incomplete 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.550
 player entered the CIA only partially 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.669
 and it looks like the interface is very 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.730
 pleasantly sharpened under the finger all 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.300
 really handling great 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.800
 and there is 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 and how would the workers become like the worker 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.180
 area tables 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.520
 which claire itself is 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.700
 musician 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.270
 here apparently should be the text of the song if 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 he is 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.450
 or it can be downloaded via 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.780
 the Internet 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 and here is the visualization 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.450
 which works very well iii 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.450
 ten is displayed as it should 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.600
 true us softline 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 list of songs 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.140
 now no need to aim as it was 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
 sometimes earlier versions 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 but what about some song 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.530
 here ask 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 autoload text we don't need it 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 there is to the volume level 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.240
 will show you work 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 visualization 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760
 settings maintain center 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760
 by the way there is a Russian language 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 original views for the desktop 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 it can be put on any place 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.920
 and here we also display 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 visualization track name but we to 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.860
 Unfortunately, the Russian will not last 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.150
 tongue 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.100
 there ground salt school holidays seeing 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.960
 what's the problem of this because he's good 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.210
 beautiful new 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 changing desktops it will be displayed 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.689
 about that place to her 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.439
 not very likely to be the same 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.349
 Total 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.499
 his location will hide behind her 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.389
 others see and which 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.269
 do you understand if you take one worker 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.149
 the table then I think it will be quite acceptable 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.449
 put it yuri 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.039
 use 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.799
 everything is working 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.870
 player apparently capital native codecs therefore 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.819
 locked view 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.209
 volume control also 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.269
 works and 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 but even 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.239
 great quality of the player 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.369
 headphone 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.029
 quite the same 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.259
 what is equal to 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 front form players therefore 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 very good after that 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.529
 m also have that meat 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.569
 can put 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.929
 caves at a construction site or set your mind to 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.929
 Unfortunately in this player we were surprised 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.889
 settings put the grain they are 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.749
 preinstalled and how them 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.749
 actually on the construction site itself 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.099
 I have little idea because they do not 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.389
 no absolutely mood 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.109
 There are also 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.379
 channel balance we suffered basic 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379
 settings for the body of any respecting player 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.299
 but he basically how many is not worth onion 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.299
 principle sound deteriorated 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.359
 in general, that and all of his as usual you can 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.369
 in the plane play mode 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.369
 mix in order 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.409
 And so on 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.999
 nice of course what 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.669
 developers do not leave the apartment 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.869
 Although many say that they have heavy 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:05.639
 times are everything else 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.699
 there are by the way 20 and nao first 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.159
 who has just been here this year 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.599
 further perhaps someone like it but I 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.059
 I think that he will be one of the girls 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.059
 however 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.340
 at 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.449
 but in general 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.909
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.699
 Thank you for all the attention Kaka
