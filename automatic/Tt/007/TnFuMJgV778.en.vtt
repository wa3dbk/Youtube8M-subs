00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

a<00:01:06.720> pocket<00:01:07.049> bucket<00:01:07.320> mod<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.420> essentially<00:01:09.420> what

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
a pocket bucket mod and essentially what

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
a pocket bucket mod and essentially what
it<00:01:09.570> does<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.960> essentially<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> tsunami

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it does it's essentially like a tsunami

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.350 
it does it's essentially like a tsunami
if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> guys<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> like

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
if you guys want to think of it like

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
if you guys want to think of it like
that<00:01:12.409> when<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> place<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:14.040> either<00:01:14.220> your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that when you place down either your

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
that when you place down either your
lava<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:15.000> water<00:01:15.030> bucket<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> works

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
lava or water bucket it kind of works

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.530 
lava or water bucket it kind of works
out<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.220> keeps<00:01:17.520> respawning<00:01:17.939> itself

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
out so it just keeps respawning itself

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
out so it just keeps respawning itself
like<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> works<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
like so and how it works is you just

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.550 
like so and how it works is you just
have<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> generate<00:01:21.030> new<00:01:21.630> chunks<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.229> believe

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have to generate new chunks I believe

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.899 
have to generate new chunks I believe
that's<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> works<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.820> when

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that's how it works and you can see when

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's how it works and you can see when
I<00:01:23.970> moved<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.720> water<00:01:24.900> comes<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I moved here the water comes with you so

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
I moved here the water comes with you so
you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> tsunami<00:01:26.640> but

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you can think of it like a tsunami but

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.760 
you can think of it like a tsunami but
you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> back<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.590> there

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you can see over at the back right there

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
you can see over at the back right there
it<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.040> doesn't<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:30.960> fall<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it actually doesn't you know fall and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
it actually doesn't you know fall and
that's<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.060> lag

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that's I think to make sure your lag

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.730 
that's I think to make sure your lag
stays<00:01:33.689> down<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> had<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> all

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
stays down because if you had it all

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
stays down because if you had it all
falling<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.430> definitely<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.030> think

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
falling it would definitely I think

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
falling it would definitely I think
crash<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.930> minecraft<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:37.979> RAM

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
crash your minecraft because so much RAM

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
crash your minecraft because so much RAM
would<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.460> being<00:01:38.790> used<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.570> anyways<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> still

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
would be being used but anyways it still

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.929 
would be being used but anyways it still
is<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.439> cool<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.829> guys<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.400> definitely

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
is pretty cool you guys can definitely

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.999 
is pretty cool you guys can definitely
do<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> damage<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.619> world<00:01:43.829> with

do a lot of damage to your world with

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this it would be hilarious to use on

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
this it would be hilarious to use on
like<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.470> friends<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.460> friends<00:01:47.640> world<00:01:47.970> if

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you guys want to go over to their house

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
you guys want to go over to their house
and<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.439> secretly<00:01:49.890> install<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.610> do

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and like secretly install it and do

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
and like secretly install it and do
something<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.630> they'll<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.110> oh

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
something like this they'll be like oh

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
something like this they'll be like oh
how<00:01:52.439> did<00:01:52.590> all<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.829> water<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
how did all this water get here so I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
how did all this water get here so I
think<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> cool<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.320> use

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
think that's kind of a cool little use

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.230 
think that's kind of a cool little use
for<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> also<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.520> use<00:01:56.549> lava<00:01:56.939> but

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
for it and also you can use lava but

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.550 
for it and also you can use lava but
that's<00:01:57.420> obviously<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.259> more

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's obviously a little bit more

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.209 
that's obviously a little bit more
damaging<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.820> lava<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:02.100> gonna

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
damaging because it's lava so I'm gonna

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.440 
damaging because it's lava so I'm gonna
go<00:02:02.369> ahead<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
go ahead and do this here and as you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
go ahead and do this here and as you
guys<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.689> tell<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> has<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> same<00:02:04.469> effect

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
guys can tell it has the same effect

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.469 
guys can tell it has the same effect
where<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.130> guys<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
where if you guys you know just kind of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
where if you guys you know just kind of
walk<00:02:06.659> around<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.380> keep

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
walk around it it will just keep

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
walk around it it will just keep
generating<00:02:08.069> forever<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.119> ever<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:10.289> is

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
generating forever and ever and this is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
generating forever and ever and this is
really<00:02:10.619> cool<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> lava<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> little

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
really cool what the lava is a little

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.930 
really cool what the lava is a little
bit<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.000> laggy<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> guys

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
bit more laggy as you guys

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.430 
bit more laggy as you guys
you<00:02:13.120> will<00:02:13.300> get<00:02:13.420> some<00:02:13.630> lag<00:02:13.870> spikes<00:02:14.260> which

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
you will get some lag spikes which

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.770 
you will get some lag spikes which
really<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.860> kind<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.520> unfortunate<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
really is kind of unfortunate but you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.300 
really is kind of unfortunate but you
know<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.960> can<00:02:17.170> kill<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> ton<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.650> mobs<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.130> you

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
know you can kill a ton of mobs that you

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.220 
know you can kill a ton of mobs that you
can<00:02:18.430> kind<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> call<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.480> trap<00:02:19.780> them<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:19.990> lava

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
can kind of call just trap them in lava

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.690 
can kind of call just trap them in lava
and<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.710> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.100> weird<00:02:21.250> they<00:02:21.400> don't<00:02:21.580> really

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and it's kind of weird they don't really

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.270 
and it's kind of weird they don't really
have<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> properties<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.750> lava<00:02:22.990> or<00:02:23.590> water<00:02:23.980> so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
have the properties of lava or water so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800 
have the properties of lava or water so
you<00:02:24.340> see<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.730> have<00:02:24.850> no<00:02:25.000> cobblestone<00:02:25.570> being

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
you see we have no cobblestone being

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.850 
you see we have no cobblestone being
made<00:02:25.960> here<00:02:26.170> which<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.440> kind<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.680> interesting

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
made here which is kind of interesting

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.570 
made here which is kind of interesting
but<00:02:27.850> um<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:29.140> also<00:02:29.410> kind<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.220> works<00:02:30.430> on

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
but um this also kind of works on

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.160 
but um this also kind of works on
servers<00:02:30.940> as<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.180> guys<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> intro

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
servers as you guys can see in the intro

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.680 
servers as you guys can see in the intro
it<00:02:33.040> doesn't<00:02:33.400> actually<00:02:33.550> grief<00:02:34.120> anything<00:02:34.570> on

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it doesn't actually grief anything on

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.270 
it doesn't actually grief anything on
the<00:02:34.810> server<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.320> really<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:35.980> show

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the server it's really just for show

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.190 
the server it's really just for show
it's<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.580> client<00:02:37.030> sided<00:02:37.330> mod<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.690> only<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.050> guys

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
it's a client sided mod so only you guys

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's a client sided mod so only you guys
will<00:02:38.380> see<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.310> make<00:02:39.610> my<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:39.910> over<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
will see it so if I make my way over to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.570 
will see it so if I make my way over to
my<00:02:40.780> buddy<00:02:41.020> exploding<00:02:41.500> TNT<00:02:41.650> server<00:02:42.190> over<00:02:42.550> here

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
my buddy exploding TNT server over here

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.490 
my buddy exploding TNT server over here
um<00:02:43.300> as<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.570> guys<00:02:43.660> could<00:02:43.870> tell<00:02:43.960> I<00:02:44.020> was<00:02:44.230> able<00:02:44.380> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
um as you guys could tell I was able to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.680 
um as you guys could tell I was able to
place<00:02:44.800> down<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.430> lava<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.240> water<00:02:46.480> but

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
place down the lava and the water but

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.720 
place down the lava and the water but
that<00:02:46.720> only<00:02:47.170> appears<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.860> my<00:02:48.130> side<00:02:48.520> of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
that only appears on my side of

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.250 
that only appears on my side of
Minecraft<00:02:49.240> so<00:02:49.390> no<00:02:49.540> one<00:02:49.660> else<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.050> server

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
Minecraft so no one else on the server

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260 
Minecraft so no one else on the server
could<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.620> seen<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.220> me<00:02:51.460> so<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.030> know

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
could have seen that but me so you know

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.640 
could have seen that but me so you know
it<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.450> still<00:02:52.660> kind<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.990> fun<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.290> guys<00:02:53.410> can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
it is still kind of fun you guys can

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.260 
it is still kind of fun you guys can
pretend<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.160> go<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.520> two<00:02:54.790> very<00:02:55.030> popular

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
pretend to go on two very popular

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.440 
pretend to go on two very popular
servers<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.200> grief<00:02:56.440> them<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.220> um<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:58.210> not

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
servers and grief them but um it's not

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.820 
servers and grief them but um it's not
actually<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.960> be<00:02:59.080> happening<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.620> can

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
actually going to be happening so I can

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.620 
actually going to be happening so I can
go<00:02:59.950> over<00:02:59.980> here<00:03:00.130> put<00:03:00.850> my<00:03:00.940> lava<00:03:01.120> bucket<00:03:01.510> down

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
go over here put my lava bucket down

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.240 
go over here put my lava bucket down
right<00:03:01.870> here<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.530> get<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.770> correctly<00:03:03.100> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
right here and if I get it correctly you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.190 
right here and if I get it correctly you
guys<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.580> see<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.000> will<00:03:04.120> spread<00:03:04.480> just

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
guys can see that it will spread just

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.540 
guys can see that it will spread just
like<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.440> does<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.650> your<00:03:05.830> single-player<00:03:06.340> world

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
like it does in your single-player world

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.610 
like it does in your single-player world
but<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.270> in<00:03:07.480> fact<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.900> doing<00:03:08.170> anything<00:03:08.380> to

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
but it is in fact not doing anything to

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
but it is in fact not doing anything to
the<00:03:08.740> server<00:03:08.950> whatsoever<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.300> really

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the server whatsoever and it's really

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
the server whatsoever and it's really
just<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:11.350> make<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.620> feel<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.980> you're<00:03:12.190> a

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
just to make you feel like you're a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.590 
just to make you feel like you're a
griever<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.610> guess<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.880> could<00:03:13.030> say<00:03:13.180> but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
griever I guess you could say but

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.820 
griever I guess you could say but
nevertheless<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.110> still<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.350> kind<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.590> fun<00:03:14.740> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
nevertheless it still is kind of fun to
