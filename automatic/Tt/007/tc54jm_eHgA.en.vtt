00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.909
 more interesting than this car charging and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.560
 so what is it this battery case 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.680
 here are two thousand 500 milliamps in it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.920
 charge 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.230

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.880
 extend twice the running time 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.090
 battery in iphone 5 or 5s lightning 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 somewhere here already opened accordingly 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.640
 watched 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.340
 the case itself is made cool 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.519
 quality is such a soft-touch coating 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.609
 please 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.219
 and we took care to leave 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.829

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.720
 the company not only catch the case but also 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.730
 forget those who buy it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.889
 so that they do not have any problems with 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 using the instructions here on 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:01.220
 foreign language look what's funny 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.870
 there is not only a case 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.090
 the battery still comes in two 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.189
 ordinary cover 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.720

 Thailand for 150 rubles how much is it 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.470
 this thing I don't know will not do anything 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.879
 talk about it already two notches cutout 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.060

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.439
 I like the salad do not like 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.510
 like all the bright colors here it was 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.930
 Earlier bright orange is now a little bit 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.549

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:45.680
 top bottom is shorter everything is super 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:48.620
 recharge it shorter here is an example we are there 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.780
 in thailand often happen if we are on 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.379

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.449
 photo 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.690
 that is, there is no plywood bit 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:58.849
 there is no cigarette lighter there 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.650
 will save 2 thousand 500 milliamps see 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.440
 how to do these you alaska who 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.120

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.500
