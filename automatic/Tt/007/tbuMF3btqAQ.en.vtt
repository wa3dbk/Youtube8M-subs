feature that I want to talk about is the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.480 
feature that I want to talk about is the
level<00:00:26.250> three<00:00:26.550> fit<00:00:26.849> liner<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.920> 32

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
level three fit liner which is all 32

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.359 
level three fit liner which is all 32
liners<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.269> heat<00:00:30.480> moldable<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
liners are heat moldable they have a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
liners are heat moldable they have a
stitch<00:00:33.150> list<00:00:33.449> construction<00:00:34.080> which

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
stitch list construction which

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
stitch list construction which
eliminates<00:00:34.710> pressure<00:00:35.220> points<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.820> well<00:00:36.330> as

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
eliminates pressure points as well as

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
eliminates pressure points as well as
really<00:00:36.750> soft<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> top<00:00:37.830> so<00:00:38.190> there's<00:00:38.460> no

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
really soft on the top so there's no

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.630 
really soft on the top so there's no
pressure<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.150> cat<00:00:40.160> another<00:00:41.160> great<00:00:41.400> thing

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
about the liner is they're coated with a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.820 
about the liner is they're coated with a
hantai<00:00:44.100> bacterial<00:00:44.760> coating<00:00:45.150> which<00:00:45.870> allows

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
hantai bacterial coating which allows

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.579 
hantai bacterial coating which allows
you<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.339> not<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.299> that<00:00:48.479> boot<00:00:48.869> stench<00:00:49.260> right

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
you to not get that boot stench right

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.460 
you to not get that boot stench right
away<00:00:49.799> which<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.309> feel<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.699> also<00:00:51.299> very<00:00:51.839> important

support in there which is great for park

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.719 
support in there which is great for park
riding<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.960> writing<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.409> general<00:01:04.729> with

riding and just writing in general with

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.810 
riding and just writing in general with
the<00:01:06.150> shell<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> couple<00:01:08.460> other<00:01:08.610> key

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the shell there's I'm a couple other key

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.450 
the shell there's I'm a couple other key
features<00:01:09.150> I'd<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> talk<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
features I'd like to talk about the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
features I'd like to talk about the
eyelet<00:01:11.460> lacing<00:01:12.150> system<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> actually

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
eyelet lacing system here is actually

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
eyelet lacing system here is actually
inside<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.270> shell<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:16.020> allows<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> boot

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
inside the shell which allows the boot

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
inside the shell which allows the boot
to<00:01:16.920> wrap<00:01:17.280> around<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.759> foot<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.270> tighten

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to wrap around your foot as you tighten

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.010 
to wrap around your foot as you tighten
which<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.140> very<00:01:19.439> important<00:01:20.270> also<00:01:21.270> has<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
which is a very important also has the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.289 
which is a very important also has the
articulating<00:01:22.710> cuff<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.189> which<00:01:23.729> eliminates

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
articulating cuff here which eliminates

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.480 
articulating cuff here which eliminates
shell<00:01:24.600> distortion<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.740> flex<00:01:26.100> forward

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
shell distortion when you flex forward

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
shell distortion when you flex forward
which<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> great<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.840> bunching<00:01:28.229> your

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
which is great there's no bunching your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.139 
which is great there's no bunching your
pressure<00:01:28.590> points<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.249> all<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.939> also

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
pressure points there at all and it also

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.590 
pressure points there at all and it also
has<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.749> interlacing<00:01:31.499> harness<00:01:31.890> system<00:01:32.600> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
has an interlacing harness system so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
has an interlacing harness system so
when<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.439> you're<00:01:34.560> strapping<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
when you when you're strapping up you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
when you when you're strapping up you
just<00:01:35.520> pull<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.060> tightens<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.539> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just pull this it tightens around the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020 
just pull this it tightens around the
ankle<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.679> lace<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
ankle and then you lace up you get that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.620 
ankle and then you lace up you get that
custom<00:01:39.659> fit<00:01:39.929> with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> wrap<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.859> and<00:01:41.630> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
custom fit with the wrap around and it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
custom fit with the wrap around and it's
just<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.899> great<00:01:43.200> boot<00:01:43.469> for<00:01:43.649> park<00:01:43.920> riding<00:01:44.159> new
