00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.239
 we have already seen in other rounds of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.340
 very fast championship the sympathetic 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.180
 Dutch champion now entering 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.289

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.979
 force the Polini officer into the championship 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 nicolò castellini that unfortunately in 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.439
 over the previous days he had a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 traffic accident the staff of pollens e 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.650
 all the other drivers obviously do 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 cheering to review as soon as possible 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.250
 nikon or nicolò we greet him and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 back on the starting straight with 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.229
 filippo courses those who can not change the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.110
 cards 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.190
 the course advantage of eight seconds e 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.280
 50 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.640
 chasing you back six to hours pays 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 ethan 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.540
 i love to see now it's touch in second 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 position 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.730
 here are the drivers returning to the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.550
 straight that cuts everything diagonally 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.550
 path 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.770
 in the meantime I see giary group the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:17.850
 number 90 jonathan zucchi takes back the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:23.530
 position investigations already gvk my 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.660
 a fall that sees ira perry unfortunately 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.240
 involved no tirereferri and here therefore 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:35.520
 the other pilot avellino dr 81 and fountain 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.520
 have been involved in a contact 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.579
 I was for nothing 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.609
 so after more than ten seconds they arrive 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.670
 roof and tirferri in spain and detached 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:53.750
 Russian is forced to enlarge it the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:59.629
 deal then suffered 45 matteo 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.879
 important points for the 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.230
 second position especially for 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.230
 close the championship speech 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:21.160
 here it is tirferri who wants to close the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:26.080
 massari speech group and still hidden 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.680
 into the windshield of his st zip Color 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.760
 Dutch handsome long entry 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.820
 keeps the road ahead ready 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.680
 on arrival the show courses can begin 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.700
 ira second position the posting 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.700
 between him and roof 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.470
 tenth 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.170
 yesterday start of the 70 evolution open in 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.030
 first row the 2013 matteo champion 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.019
 tirferriri at his side filippo courses e 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.500
 then the Dutch champion series spray 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.379
 the prof 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.250
 the Dutch champion who fails however 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:20.130
 to surprise filippo courses what a part 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:21.720
 immediately at the command ira ferri and third e 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.190
 then we see the rest of the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.389
 patrol we immediately recognize the livery 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:36.330
 of filippo accorsi regarding 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:38.880
 the colorful helmet that leads to the race 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.880
 tirferriri and third should be the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.699
 Dutch champion 2013 sari group in 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:56.270
 second position in wrapper row ed 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:59.570
 it is he who recruit yen and the command 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.070
 accustomed to more slippery funds because 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.740
 coming from the Dutch championship where 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.690
 the weather is certainly different from the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.590
 our 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.599
 is familiar with the track in 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.419
 this moment near the circuit 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.690
 international viterbo then tender 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.849
 more uncertain than ever, however, it is in 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.819
 form in this race 2 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.469
 nine laps of the race turns on Pietro del 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.469
 115 then the times 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.780
 which I am compared to what we are 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:40.240
 widely used to pilots 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 of the most prestigious category in 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.820
 this time on the track courses he is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:53.470
 reducing and shooting and counting the two 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:57.759
 in front then a trio a trio of 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:01.060
 riders who are fighting for the first one 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:07.080
 position I saw a sari slip 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:12.070
 cruz betrayed just by a plot to him 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.639
 congenial perhaps excessive security 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.759
 that of a Russian woman who leaves again 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.289
 from the third position and now challenge pulls 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.919
 for appeals courses he is pulling 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.509
 however not bad breaks 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.840
 so I would go see the last one 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.840
 passage 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:39.090
 jonathan zucchi passes at this time 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:41.440
 with this beautiful podium we hope to go 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.440
 materialize 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.790
 great satisfaction for 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.790
 the club driver 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.790
 evandro 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:07.410
 the lots that are about to end 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:13.750
 the last gyrating round that he lost 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:17.440
 a few meters rescues cuts to the 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:22.290
 finish line matteo tiraferri cuts the 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.290
 finish line in monoruota filippo courses 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.680
 matthew now pull the trio because it is 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.260
 the third year that wins consecutively 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.840
 this polini italian cup in the trophy more 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.960
 prestigious ie the 70 scooter 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:47.560
 evolution open a season anyway 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.520
 all uphill but with the title brought to 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.720
 home 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.760
 yes we brought home too 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.740
 this year was beautiful 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.530
 even more fought in other years 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.080
 we had fun with many races on the 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.310
 wet compared to past years 

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.230
 okay so we prepare for the 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.400
 next year and we hope to do more 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.350
 like this year 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.160
 a greeting to nicolò who is sick at home and 

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.160
 we hope he gets better soon
