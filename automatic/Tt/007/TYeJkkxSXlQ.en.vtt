day will be open to the public and I'm
here<00:01:22.440> looking<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.010> electric<00:01:23.940> pickup<00:01:24.210> truck

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
here looking for electric pickup truck

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.670 
here looking for electric pickup truck
I'm<00:01:25.380> goal<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.190> totally<00:01:26.760> off-grid<00:01:27.090> off

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
I'm goal is to be totally off-grid off

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.290 
I'm goal is to be totally off-grid off
fuel<00:01:28.680> pumps<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> everything<00:01:29.250> else<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.910> maybe

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
fuel pumps and everything else and maybe

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.160 
fuel pumps and everything else and maybe
the<00:01:31.080> solar<00:01:31.290> array<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:32.270> charge<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> truck<00:01:33.720> from

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the solar array to charge the truck from

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.609 
the solar array to charge the truck from
my<00:01:34.440> own<00:01:34.830> rooftop<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:36.170> few<00:01:37.170> few

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
my own rooftop has a very few few

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.510 
my own rooftop has a very few few
mileage<00:01:38.509> requirements<00:01:39.509> annual<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.399> think

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
mileage requirements annual so I think

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
mileage requirements annual so I think
it<00:01:41.729> might<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.910> feasible<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.420> run<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.110> right

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
it might be feasible to run that right

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.630 
it might be feasible to run that right
off<00:01:43.410> my

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

make one up some say big bear so I have
about<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.480> 60<00:02:07.840> mile<00:02:07.990> range<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> last<00:02:08.860> 20

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
about a 60 mile range but the last 20

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.240 
about a 60 mile range but the last 20
miles<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:09.640> goes<00:02:09.820> up<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.630> steep<00:02:10.780> grades<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
miles of that goes up a steep grades so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.670 
miles of that goes up a steep grades so
maybe<00:02:13.880> reconsider<00:02:14.540> recharging<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> base

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
maybe reconsider recharging in the base

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.080 
maybe reconsider recharging in the base
