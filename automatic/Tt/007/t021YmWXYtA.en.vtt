00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.000
 story has nothing to do with us 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:12.189

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.000
 grape day is history every decision that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.560
 we drink every day 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 every time you decide to turn to the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.850

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.509

 I guarantee that you will not be the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.850
 better people that can be because 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.170
 the story is about opportunities 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.820
 lost 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.740
