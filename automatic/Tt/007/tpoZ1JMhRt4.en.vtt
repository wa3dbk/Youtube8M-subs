pretty easy to do but any to any way to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.760 
pretty easy to do but any to any way to
make<00:02:05.739> a<00:02:05.940> passive<00:02:06.940> mob<00:02:07.149> spawner<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.590> do

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
make a passive mob spawner you can do

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.859

them<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:36.959> together<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:37.920> pour

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
them up together and then it will pour

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.130 
them up together and then it will pour
them<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.270> they'll<00:02:39.600> fall<00:02:39.780> through<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
them in here they'll fall through the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.650 
them in here they'll fall through the
lava<00:02:40.370> then<00:02:41.370> they'll<00:02:41.610> still<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.120> fire<00:02:42.390> over

you're<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.319> a<00:03:07.350> server<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.190> can

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you're in a server because as you can

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.410 
you're in a server because as you can
see<00:03:08.340> right<00:03:08.489> now<00:03:08.610> we're<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.030> server<00:03:09.269> right

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
see right now we're in a server right

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.610 
see right now we're in a server right
now<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.140> something<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.380> works

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
now and it's something that works

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.740 
now and it's something that works
perfectly<00:03:10.980> fine<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:12.269> could<00:03:12.420> open<00:03:12.690> up

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
perfectly fine and you could open up

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.009 
perfectly fine and you could open up
your<00:03:12.959> own<00:03:13.019> just<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:15.019> whatever

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
your own just or you can make a whatever

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.750 
your own just or you can make a whatever
to<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.069> economy<00:03:17.670> or

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
to if they have like economy or

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
to if they have like economy or
something<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.450> you'll<00:03:18.720> basically<00:03:18.930> have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
something so you'll basically have

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.800 
something so you'll basically have
unlimited<00:03:19.709> food<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.370> now<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.269> updates
