00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello my name is Oleg I am a doctor 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 marketer 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.750
 and today i want to tell you about 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 how to make sure that you want in the morning 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.449
 do not force yourself to run 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.890
 namely, they wanted to run, I understand that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.570
 this topic is complicated 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.760
 get up in the morning there swing get off at 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 the street 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.899
 it is really difficult to eat such as 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.670
 technique how to get rid of the problems you need 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:41.010
 just call the problem no problem 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 the task is always more interesting to solve 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 rather than think about the problem so here we are 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 there is a task to start wanting to run and I'm for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.629
 yourself came up with such a topic how to implement 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 element and gamification more precisely turn 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.280
 it's somehow into play if you sit and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.390
 think you can come up with a lot 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.920
 ways to turn it into a game i 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.820
 for example did as follows 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.290
 as this all goes within the flash mob 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.920
 f m apocalypse i decided to draw my own 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.430
 running hashtag fm. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.869
 underscore apocalypse 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.799
 probably not quite understand what I mean 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.460
 I say therefore just show me there 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 here is such 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 Smartphone inexpensive and that to me here 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.920
 like it here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.370
 android and the mass of any applications 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 interesting so here 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.940
 there is a theme like endomondo 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.000
 called the program the meaning is 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.710
 in the fact that I do not know it will be visible not visible 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.290
 this sports trekking is watching you 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 where do you run her sense into what she is on 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.080
 map draw where you are and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 draws a train for you when you run 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.240
 actually it makes me want 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.050
 in the morning get up and run a certain 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.440
 some distance and draw these here 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.440
 letters
