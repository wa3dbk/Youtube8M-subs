 welcome to one more video on the channel and 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.690
 very good we will establish what would be 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.520
 something in gta 5 online since it is some 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.720
 reference to a secret or an interest 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.809
 as you want to call 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.180
 very funny very very weird that this is 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.879
 about tracy the like straits I do not know how 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.530
 is this if it is tracy 35 I do not know the best 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.780
 as it is called very well but the daughter of 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 michael could be a stripper believe 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.300
 It 's a strip but now I'm going to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.640
 give as a t a small reference 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.649
 what's here on the table is just good 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.630
 you can search it in campaign or mode 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.890
 this does not matter but they would have 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.600
 to come to the table and once being at 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
 who in the pool dance in the super 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.190
 super antro this one we would have to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.170
 approach a little boy and a girl and 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.369
 a girlie and we would have to go to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.020
 a private that as if we were a 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.250
 private so we can go through there 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.229
 back to go to whatever the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.740
 dressing rooms where they dress 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.720
 sluts these once entering we're going 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 to go all right here where is your 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.700
 the locker room here the dice all that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.170
 but if we realize 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 we must that here is a small bear of 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.659
 stuffed animal that is there 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.090
 well put there in the middle of the ledge 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.860
 it's there so you can see it but 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.060
 They know that this bear goes elsewhere 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.070
 that right now I'm going to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.720
 say see how well they see this bear 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.539
 ok well this bear that now 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.700
 we will automatically pass this on like this 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.350
 out of nothing we're going to go to the campaign and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.970
 now we go back ok I'm just going to go 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.220
 campaign to michael's house so that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.990
 see where this bear is from 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.940
 good people as we are already here in what 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.190
 that would be michael's house but if 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.680
 we go to what would be the fourth 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.870
 of tracy that is the protagonist to this 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.820
 daughter of michael city and we are going 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.830
 to this room we will notice that there is a 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.590
 peculiar object that you have already seen 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 before in the movie story3 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.580
 exactly 3 and I had a lotus plush 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.590
 there is not certain do not believe is the stuffed animal 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.320
 exactly the one that was on the table 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.850
 dance in the strip club this is 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.310
 that same use so here is where 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.590
 comes and you ask will be tracy a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.930
 woman of gallant life will be won 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 life and dancing in a fucking tube 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.430
 this I would say yes I would say yes for 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.070
 this peculiar bear since as we see it is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.510
 the same fuckin bear or does not change 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.850
 nothing is the same here they will be seeing 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.100
 Like another type of little shirt if by art of 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.320
 magic was going to be the bear but in the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.030
 table dance this to judy I feel so 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.400
 if it is the same and if it is tracy 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.080
 they were already giving him out there because 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.420
 Well, as we know, they also caught it 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.700
 the campaign being a video by nation 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.709
 be there with your friends at the bar and then 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.420
 there he's going to rescue her from dad not so 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.860
 could it have several indications that it is 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.440
 a tracy is 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.300
 Paul dance so I would say that 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.290
 because if not below the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.330
 comments tell me what do you think 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.790

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.290
 down and then it would be all not so then 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.790
