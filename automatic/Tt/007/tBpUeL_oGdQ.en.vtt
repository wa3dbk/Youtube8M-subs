after I originally got it the cube did
get<00:02:58.799> better<00:02:58.980> after<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> few<00:02:59.459> stalls<00:02:59.909> but<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.810> was

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
get better after a few stalls but it was

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.740 
get better after a few stalls but it was
so<00:03:01.109> very<00:03:01.560> gummy<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.040> very<00:03:02.220> slow<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.299> tried

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
so very gummy and very slow so I tried

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.289 
so very gummy and very slow so I tried
Camillus<00:03:04.169> method<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.709> D<00:03:05.010> coming<00:03:05.280> cubes<00:03:05.849> which

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
Camillus method of D coming cubes which

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.869 
Camillus method of D coming cubes which
helped<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.780> lot<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.950> addition<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.849> also

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
helped a lot in addition to that I also

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.199 
helped a lot in addition to that I also
loosen<00:03:09.689> the<00:03:09.780> keep<00:03:09.989> slightly<00:03:10.579> now<00:03:11.579> after<00:03:12.060> I've

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
loosen the keep slightly now after I've

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.360 
loosen the keep slightly now after I've
done<00:03:12.389> lots<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.840> salt<00:03:13.079> on<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.709> has<00:03:14.069> since

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
done lots of salt on it it has since

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.879 
done lots of salt on it it has since
become<00:03:14.579> amazing<00:03:15.299> that's<00:03:16.260> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.560> turning

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
become amazing that's with the turning

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.860 
become amazing that's with the turning
the<00:03:17.069> cube<00:03:17.340> feels<00:03:17.609> like<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.849> mix<00:03:18.060> between<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.659> goo

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the cube feels like a mix between a goo

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.539 
the cube feels like a mix between a goo
hyung<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.319> Ashanti<00:03:19.590> which<00:03:20.129> I<00:03:20.280> personally

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
hyung and Ashanti which I personally

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.199 
hyung and Ashanti which I personally
really<00:03:21.060> enjoy<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:22.919> spank<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.549> as<00:03:23.760> fast<00:03:24.060> as

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
really enjoy the spank on is as fast as

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.080 
really enjoy the spank on is as fast as
my<00:03:24.659> goo<00:03:24.959> hyung<00:03:25.169> or<00:03:25.440> my<00:03:25.799> Santi<00:03:26.310> which<00:03:26.819> are<00:03:27.000> both

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
my goo hyung or my Santi which are both

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.409 
my goo hyung or my Santi which are both
really<00:03:27.419> loose<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.079> as<00:03:28.379> a<00:03:28.409> result<00:03:28.799> very<00:03:28.859> fast

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
really loose and as a result very fast

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.849 
really loose and as a result very fast
however<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.840> much<00:03:31.019> faster<00:03:31.229> compared<00:03:31.799> to

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
however it is much faster compared to

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.969 
however it is much faster compared to
many<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.489> other<00:03:32.849> cubes<00:03:33.449> I<00:03:33.720> am<00:03:34.530> planning<00:03:34.829> on

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
many of my other cubes I am planning on

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.559 
many of my other cubes I am planning on
making<00:03:35.159> this<00:03:35.370> cute<00:03:35.669> little<00:03:35.699> looser<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
making this cute little looser in the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.349 
making this cute little looser in the
future<00:03:37.109> but<00:03:37.799> for<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.220> video<00:03:38.519> I've<00:03:38.879> kept<00:03:39.209> it

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
future but for this video I've kept it

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.080 
future but for this video I've kept it
at<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.750> current<00:03:40.139> tension<00:03:40.579> one<00:03:41.579> problem<00:03:41.909> is

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
at the current tension one problem is

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.640 
at the current tension one problem is
that<00:03:42.269> one<00:03:42.419> corner<00:03:42.810> cutting<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.199> center<00:03:43.470> cap

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
that one corner cutting the center cap

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.369 
that one corner cutting the center cap
sometimes<00:03:44.190> comes<00:03:44.519> off<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.659> pink<00:03:45.840> gum<00:03:46.049> pops

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
sometimes comes off the pink gum pops

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.229 
sometimes comes off the pink gum pops
about<00:03:46.739> as<00:03:46.859> much<00:03:47.010> as<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> zonkey<00:03:47.790> when<00:03:48.060> both

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
about as much as a zonkey when both

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.149 
about as much as a zonkey when both
cubes<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.930> at<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.079> same<00:03:49.290> tension<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:50.129> a

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
cubes are at the same tension for a

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.610 
cubes are at the same tension for a
corner<00:03:50.430> cutting<00:03:50.609> this<00:03:50.909> cube<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.510> amazing<00:03:52.079> you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
corner cutting this cube is amazing you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.379 
corner cutting this cube is amazing you
can<00:03:52.799> corner<00:03:53.040> cut<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.579> about<00:03:53.849> 50<00:03:54.239> degrees

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
can corner cut up to about 50 degrees

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.020 
can corner cut up to about 50 degrees
and<00:03:54.870> reverse<00:03:55.500> cut<00:03:55.799> about<00:03:56.250> three<00:03:56.310> quarters<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
and reverse cut about three quarters of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.210 
and reverse cut about three quarters of
the<00:03:57.419> Kyuubi<00:03:57.870> because<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.829> this<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.159> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
the Kyuubi because of this and the

of becoming my means since there really

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.130 
of becoming my means since there really
isn't<00:04:38.950> much<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.370> complain<00:04:39.940> about<00:04:40.060> if<00:04:40.930> anything

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
isn't much to complain about if anything

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
the only bad about this cube is the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.420 
the only bad about this cube is the
center<00:04:43.600> caps<00:04:43.840> which<00:04:44.260> don't<00:04:44.530> really<00:04:44.890> affect<00:04:44.980> me
