00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 today's task is to chop plants 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.069
 coffee germinated coffee companies 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.070
 they have to take some details in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.050
 The first thing is that the plant is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.720
 be healthy that does not have the diffuse root 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.750
 so have two roots that do not have 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.980
 a defined main root that is what 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.529
 first that you have to take into account for 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.070
 plant a coffee seed 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.270
 germinated then 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.340
 if the root was very long it is very 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 prolonged we proceed to cut him a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.379
 little bit of Carlos and a little bit then 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.470
 with that wooden quill made manually 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.470
 then we proceed to do 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.829
 a hole in the same heart the same 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.089
 means of force 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.390
 then like this to seal the hole is not 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.750
 can plug up there you have to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 cover it from below so that the hole in 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.190
 the case does not have any space left 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.910
 that not between the West 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.910
 in Cali 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.979
 hanson in the garden 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 yes 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 surrounded 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.469
 then this plant is put here 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.770
 that was transferred from the germinator to the 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:02.369
 funda is supposed to last here between 3 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.320
 and 4 months to be able to take the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 field to plant it and the farm of the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.209
 producers 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.569
 I am look for that both received the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.819
 plants when growers grow 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.140
 directly and then there is an agreement 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.960
 with the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.830
 the environment to give help to 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.800
 the producers 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.600
 in the process of planting that is when 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.850
 the producers come and receive their 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.410
 plant transport her to her farm 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.320
 then with the brigades of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 reforestation we proceed to plant them 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.860
 the producers 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.520
 this is a very important contribution not 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.490
 only for the product 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 this is an area eminently 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.290
 coffee plantation in the upper river basin 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.290
 and one 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.650
 we have very clear that coffee 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 coffee plantations contribute to 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.030
 the conservation of the environment 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.849
 also so apart from that they are the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.940
 main agricultural item that generates 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.340
 income to the peasants and to the same country 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.380
 it was a lot of currency then the others 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.060
 ministers very clear that the middle 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.550
 ambient 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.230
 is possibly the largest of the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.430
 benefits because we the people that 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.959
 we live here on the hill say woman 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.000
 Our main production source 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.500
 it's coffee but I say that our 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 The main source of production is 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.640
 water you have to protect these at four o'clock 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.380
 first in here for benefit not 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.730
 only from the communities and 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.500
 families that live here in the mountains 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.080
 but of the hundreds of thousands of families 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 who live in the lower basin of the river and 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.230
 then right now we have 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.269
 a threat from the Dominican Republic 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.340
 with a disease that has attacked the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.610
 coffee and this these plants that are 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.100
 putting here in this nursery belong 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.569
 to a new variety of coffee that is 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.250
 introducing the country that is resistant 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.160
 to this type of disease that attack you 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.650
 of coffee that the stream 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.210
 and we hope that the next few years 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.800
 producers re-establish their 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.280
 own plantation again because they have 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.810
 been very attacked 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.970
 so we are contributing with a 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 nation project and the state in this 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.959
 If your bit because there is a 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.490
 mandate of the president of the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.880
 republic that the institutions that 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.640
 they have to do with sector 3 and coffee a 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.919
 what custom environment the indrhi to 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.730
 every institution contribute to the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.550
 promotion of 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.950
 in coffee plantations again you do not want 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.340
 say that apart from us as 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.830
 peasant organization 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.600
 family and mountain communities 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.380
 we were contributing with 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.990
 improves the income of producers 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.090
 on the one hand on the other hand the state in 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.690
 this case the current government is 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.400
 helping to make a new 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.830
 coverage of a new plantation 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.990
 coffee then there is a third element 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.080
 fundamental in the participation of 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.530
 you young people from the universities 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.670
 of Canada is linked to inter 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.820
 are contributing to the efforts 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.020
 then it is something that must be taken in 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.449
 account 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.340
 and you in the future may say we have 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.150
 contribute to the conservation of the river 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.610
 and one 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.990
 and from its upper watershed and we have contributed 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.759
 also with the improvement of 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.590
 quality of family life that 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.590
 mountain thank you
