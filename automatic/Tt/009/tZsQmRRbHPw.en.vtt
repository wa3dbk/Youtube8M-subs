most of the couplings and adjustments

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.490 
most of the couplings and adjustments
are<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.240> be<00:02:17.330> plastic<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.080> know<00:02:18.140> keep<00:02:18.380> in

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
mind this is a $54 kit so this is the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.280 
mind this is a $54 kit so this is the
hash<00:02:21.590> stand<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.660> imagine<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.050> kind

of loosen that collar goes back in the
top<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:29.060> these<00:02:29.770> I'll<00:02:30.770> have<00:02:31.130> kind<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.490> screw

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
top of these I'll have kind of a screw

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.380 
top of these I'll have kind of a screw
bolt<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.120> okay<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.500> mount<00:02:34.390> cameras

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
bolt on okay so you can mount cameras

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.700 
bolt on okay so you can mount cameras
and<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:35.600> sorts<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.900> stuff<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.140> them<00:02:36.380> too<00:02:36.590> if

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
and all sorts of stuff to them too if

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.820 
and all sorts of stuff to them too if
you<00:02:36.800> ever<00:02:36.920> want<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.190> use<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.650> way

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
you ever want to use it for that the way

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.220 
you ever want to use it for that the way
in<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.870> legs<00:02:41.870> work<00:02:43.720> they<00:02:44.720> kind<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:45.020> come<00:02:45.200> out

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
in the legs work they kind of come out

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 
in the legs work they kind of come out
see<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:45.920> do<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.250> like<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.700> they

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
see if we can do this like that they

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.820 
see if we can do this like that they
kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> come<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:52.300> okay<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.590> it's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
kind of come out like that okay so it's

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.490 
kind of come out like that okay so it's
you<00:02:55.130> know<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:56.209> seems<00:02:56.600> pretty<00:02:56.810> solid<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.470> far

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
you know it it seems pretty solid so far

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.110 
you know it it seems pretty solid so far
I<00:02:57.920> mean<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.550> we're<00:02:58.640> going<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.970> with

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
I mean for what we're going to do with

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.830 
I mean for what we're going to do with
it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

light bulbs it comes with three light

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.490 
light bulbs it comes with three light
bulbs<00:03:01.730> these<00:03:02.270> are<00:03:02.450> 120<00:03:03.230> volts<00:03:04.360> 45<00:03:05.360> watt<00:03:05.840> bulbs

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
bulbs these are 120 volts 45 watt bulbs

now that I was reading about this the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.960 
now that I was reading about this the
kit<00:03:08.630> says<00:03:08.900> it's<00:03:09.080> 600<00:03:09.650> watts<00:03:09.860> but<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.850> got

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
kit says it's 600 watts but it's got

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.220 
kit says it's 600 watts but it's got
something<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.480> with<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.660> conversion

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
something to do with the conversion

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.970 
something to do with the conversion
between<00:03:12.430> standard<00:03:13.660> output<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:15.230> compact

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
between standard output and compact

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.640 
between standard output and compact
fluorescent<00:03:16.489> light<00:03:16.640> output<00:03:17.600> if<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.320> can<00:03:18.440> find

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
fluorescent light output if I can find

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.050 
fluorescent light output if I can find
that<00:03:18.830> I'll<00:03:18.980> put<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.190> link<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.550> definition

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
that I'll put a link to the definition

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.790 
that I'll put a link to the definition
in<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.180> in<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.600> description<00:03:20.989> below<00:03:21.110> but

something like that the tall one is got
more<00:04:10.730> space<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.300> go<00:04:11.510> it's<00:04:12.440> basically<00:04:12.740> just<00:04:12.860> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
more space to go it's basically just the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.160 
more space to go it's basically just the
umbrellas<00:04:13.610> hitting<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.910> ceiling<00:04:14.240> you<00:04:15.080> can

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
umbrellas hitting the ceiling you can

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.750 
umbrellas hitting the ceiling you can
see<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.380> standard<00:04:15.740> sized<00:04:15.980> doorframe<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
see the standard sized doorframe in the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.160 
see the standard sized doorframe in the
back<00:04:16.940> there<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:20.600> just<00:04:20.780> wanted<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:21.019> show<00:04:21.109> you

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
back there so I just wanted to show you

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.780 
back there so I just wanted to show you
what<00:04:21.290> it<00:04:21.410> looked<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:21.739> we're<00:04:22.640> going<00:04:22.730> to

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
what it looked like so we're going to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.060 
what it looked like so we're going to
set<00:04:22.970> up<00:04:23.090> an<00:04:23.270> experiment<00:04:24.080> here<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.440> use<00:04:24.920> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
set up an experiment here to use the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.470 
set up an experiment here to use the
regular<00:04:25.220> lighting<00:04:25.670> and<00:04:25.790> then<00:04:25.880> use<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.240> and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
regular lighting and then use this and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.879 
regular lighting and then use this and
see<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.660> there's<00:04:26.810> any<00:04:26.930> any<00:04:27.830> difference

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.219 

okay<00:04:31.889> so<00:04:31.949> here<00:04:32.580> we're<00:04:33.210> we're<00:04:33.900> going<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.050> use

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
okay so here we're we're going to use

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.969 
okay so here we're we're going to use
Ned<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> family<00:04:35.009> dog<00:04:35.219> here<00:04:35.580> as<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:36.560> as<00:04:37.560> a

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
Ned the family dog here as a as a

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.860 
Ned the family dog here as a as a
example<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.879> clear<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.150> space<00:04:39.360> against<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
example of clear to space against the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.950 
example of clear to space against the
wall<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.349> just<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.770> try<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.819> get<00:04:42.060> an<00:04:42.300> apples

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
wall here just to try and get an apples

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.550 
wall here just to try and get an apples
to<00:04:43.020> apples<00:04:43.379> comparison<00:04:43.439> of<00:04:45.229> regular<00:04:46.229> lighting

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
to apples comparison of regular lighting

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.290 
to apples comparison of regular lighting
versus<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.919> lighting<00:04:47.159> kit<00:04:47.370> okay<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:47.819> right<00:04:48.180> now

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
versus a lighting kit okay so right now

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.209 
versus a lighting kit okay so right now
I've<00:04:48.389> got<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.659> regular<00:04:49.259> lights<00:04:49.800> on<00:04:50.039> in<00:04:50.189> my

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219 
I've got the regular lights on in my

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.080 
I've got the regular lights on in my
office<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:50.879> an<00:04:50.969> overhead<00:04:51.360> light<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.889> a<00:04:53.090> like

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
office it's an overhead light and a like

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.050 
office it's an overhead light and a like
an<00:04:54.240> end<00:04:54.629> table<00:04:54.870> light<00:04:55.199> okay<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.580> what<00:04:56.819> we<00:04:56.939> do

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
an end table light okay so what we do

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.719 
an end table light okay so what we do
now<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.419> is<00:04:57.599> turn<00:04:58.050> on<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.259> kit<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:59.490> next

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
now is is turn on the kit and the next

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.730 
now is is turn on the kit and the next
frame<00:04:59.939> you'll<00:05:00.150> see<00:05:00.210> Nettie<00:05:00.629> hopefully<00:05:01.590> better

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
frame you'll see Nettie hopefully better

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.679 
frame you'll see Nettie hopefully better
illuminated<00:05:02.430> okay<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:02.729> what<00:05:03.029> I've<00:05:03.150> done<00:05:03.330> is

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
light bulb kind of straight in front of

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.200 
light bulb kind of straight in front of
them<00:05:17.189> by<00:05:17.430> about<00:05:17.689> six<00:05:18.689> feet

them by about six feet
so<00:05:21.210> next<00:05:21.539> step<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.930> I'm<00:05:22.050> going<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.229> turn<00:05:22.409> off

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
so next step is I'm going to turn off

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.219 
so next step is I'm going to turn off
the<00:05:22.740> overhead<00:05:23.009> light<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.300> end<00:05:24.689> table

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
the overhead light and the end table

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.679 
the overhead light and the end table
light<00:05:25.379> so<00:05:25.860> here's<00:05:26.340> Ned<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:27.000> eliminated<00:05:27.539> by

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
light so here's Ned just eliminated by

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.800 
light so here's Ned just eliminated by
the<00:05:27.750> three<00:05:28.139> lights<00:05:28.770> in<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:28.979> light<00:05:29.159> kit<00:05:29.810> so

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
the three lights in the light kit so

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.969 
the three lights in the light kit so
hopefully<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.199> gives<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.439> kind<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.710> a<00:05:31.770> decent

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
hopefully it gives you kind of a decent

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:43.570 
hopefully it gives you kind of a decent
comparison<00:05:32.909> a<00:05:33.060> B<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.900> C

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.670 

a<00:05:43.699> quick<00:05:44.180> experiment<00:05:44.509> here<00:05:44.870> on<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.289> something

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
a quick experiment here on and something

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.100 
a quick experiment here on and something
really<00:05:45.949> close<00:05:46.189> up<00:05:46.330> again<00:05:47.330> here<00:05:47.569> is<00:05:47.659> Ned<00:05:47.930> I've

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
really close up again here is Ned I've

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.490 
really close up again here is Ned I've
got<00:05:48.259> them<00:05:48.349> sitting<00:05:48.530> directly<00:05:49.099> underneath<00:05:49.520> the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
got them sitting directly underneath the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.020 
got them sitting directly underneath the
overhead<00:05:51.500> light<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:51.889> then<00:05:52.250> on<00:05:52.520> either<00:05:52.669> side

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030

it's several hours later the first time
I<00:07:02.970> ran<00:07:03.210> those<00:07:03.389> first<00:07:03.689> two<00:07:03.810> experiments<00:07:04.349> it<00:07:04.770> was

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
I ran those first two experiments it was

I ran those first two experiments it was
like<00:07:05.129> early<00:07:05.159> afternoon<00:07:05.819> so<00:07:05.849> even<00:07:06.330> though<00:07:06.389> I

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
like early afternoon so even though I

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.779 
like early afternoon so even though I
had<00:07:06.599> the<00:07:06.720> blinds<00:07:07.319> closed<00:07:07.590> in<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:07.979> office<00:07:08.639> here

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:08.789 
had the blinds closed in the office here

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:09.649 
had the blinds closed in the office here
they<00:07:08.879> were<00:07:08.969> still<00:07:09.210> some<00:07:09.360> light<00:07:09.509> bleeding

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
they were still some light bleeding

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.929 
they were still some light bleeding
through<00:07:10.159> might<00:07:11.159> have<00:07:11.280> kind<00:07:11.430> of<00:07:11.460> washed<00:07:11.729> out

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
through might have kind of washed out

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.360 
through might have kind of washed out
some<00:07:12.180> of<00:07:12.240> the<00:07:12.300> differences<00:07:12.719> between<00:07:13.370> light

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
some of the differences between light

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.800 
some of the differences between light
get<00:07:14.550> no<00:07:14.699> light<00:07:14.849> kits<00:07:15.090> we're<00:07:15.389> going<00:07:15.509> to<00:07:15.569> go<00:07:15.659> from

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
get no light kits we're going to go from

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.170 
get no light kits we're going to go from
this<00:07:15.960> to<00:07:16.349> that<00:07:16.400> so<00:07:17.400> this<00:07:17.520> is<00:07:17.580> again<00:07:17.879> I've<00:07:18.030> got

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
this to that so this is again I've got

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.170 
this to that so this is again I've got
the<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:19.560> one<00:07:19.770> taller<00:07:20.400> in<00:07:20.669> front<00:07:20.879> of<00:07:20.939> me<00:07:21.000> and

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
the the one taller in front of me and

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.909 
the the one taller in front of me and
the<00:07:21.419> other<00:07:21.539> tall<00:07:21.780> one<00:07:21.960> right<00:07:21.990> drive<00:07:22.650> it<00:07:22.770> to<00:07:22.830> my

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
the other tall one right drive it to my

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.550 
the other tall one right drive it to my
left<00:07:23.599> so<00:07:24.599> hopefully<00:07:24.990> that<00:07:25.169> gives<00:07:25.199> you<00:07:25.469> a

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
left so hopefully that gives you a

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.480 
left so hopefully that gives you a
little<00:07:26.460> bit<00:07:26.550> more<00:07:26.729> dramatic<00:07:27.740> visual<00:07:28.740> as<00:07:29.159> to

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
little bit more dramatic visual as to

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.800 
little bit more dramatic visual as to
what<00:07:29.669> the<00:07:29.789> light<00:07:29.939> kit<00:07:30.150> doesn't<00:07:30.360> want<00:07:30.599> doesn't

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
what the light kit doesn't want doesn't

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.649 
what the light kit doesn't want doesn't

again<00:07:45.870> just<00:07:46.650> trying<00:07:47.039> to<00:07:47.129> get<00:07:47.190> basic<00:07:47.550> basic

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 
again just trying to get basic basic

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.580 
again just trying to get basic basic
basic<00:07:47.909> I<00:07:48.360> think<00:07:48.569> that<00:07:48.719> the<00:07:48.900> webcam<00:07:49.289> was<00:07:49.469> like

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590 
basic I think that the webcam was like

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.360 
basic I think that the webcam was like
75<00:07:49.949> bucks<00:07:50.310> the<00:07:50.550> kit<00:07:50.759> was<00:07:50.969> 55<00:07:51.690> 54<00:07:52.289> bucks

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.370 
75 bucks the kit was 55 54 bucks

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.059 
75 bucks the kit was 55 54 bucks
so<00:07:53.849> hopefully<00:07:54.840> this<00:07:55.080> is<00:07:55.199> a<00:07:55.229> this<00:07:55.740> is<00:07:55.889> helpful

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:56.069 
so hopefully this is a this is helpful

00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:57.320 
so hopefully this is a this is helpful
