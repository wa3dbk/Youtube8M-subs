00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
to want to cut it with a scissor I'm

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.229 
to want to cut it with a scissor I'm
going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> take<00:00:34.530> your<00:00:34.739> string<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:38.239> tiny

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
going to take your string and a tiny

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:48.279 
going to take your string and a tiny

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.840 

so<00:00:48.769> now<00:00:48.980> you<00:00:49.039> have<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.879> loop<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.699> do<00:00:52.789> it

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
so now you have a loop I like to do it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.299 
so now you have a loop I like to do it
with<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.969> small<00:00:53.300> loop<00:00:53.649> because<00:00:54.649> my<00:00:54.949> hands<00:00:55.159> are

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
with a small loop because my hands are

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.099 
with a small loop because my hands are
small<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.239> prefer<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:56.690> way<00:00:56.809> but

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
small and I just prefer it that way but

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.959 
small and I just prefer it that way but
if<00:00:57.289> you<00:00:58.000> need<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.030> make<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.359> big<00:00:59.690> gob<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.969> bigger

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
if you need to make a big gob a bigger

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.930 
if you need to make a big gob a bigger
loop<00:01:02.149> then<00:01:02.420> go<00:01:02.750> right<00:01:02.930> ahead<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:04.040> what<00:01:04.850> you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
loop then go right ahead so what you

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.730 
loop then go right ahead so what you
want<00:01:05.149> to<00:01:05.210> do<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:05.720> hold<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.310> this<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:08.740> then

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
want to do is hold it like this and then

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.060 
want to do is hold it like this and then
you<00:01:10.190> want<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.490> turn<00:01:13.270> one<00:01:14.270> hand<00:01:14.630> in<00:01:15.530> circular

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
you want to turn one hand in circular

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.130 
you want to turn one hand in circular
motion<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:18.110> turns<00:01:18.409> kind<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.909> into<00:01:19.909> a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
motion so that it turns kind of into a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.320 
motion so that it turns kind of into a
bowtie<00:01:21.140> like<00:01:21.380> that<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:25.060> you're<00:01:26.060> going

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
bowtie like that and then you're going

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.030 
bowtie like that and then you're going
to<00:01:26.509> want<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:28.990> place<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.649> thread

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.770 

on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.850> eyebrows<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.300> you<00:01:38.510> want<00:01:38.690> to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
on the the eyebrows that you want to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.590 
on the the eyebrows that you want to
remove<00:01:38.990> on<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.260> hair<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.010> now<00:01:40.820> what<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.180> want<00:01:41.480> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
remove on the hair so now what I want to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.260 
remove on the hair so now what I want to
do<00:01:41.780> is<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.230> want<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.710> place<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:44.810> side<00:01:46.270> where

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
do is I want to place this side where

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.230 
do is I want to place this side where
the<00:01:47.420> gap<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.740> direction<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.060> hairs

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
the gap is in the direction of the hairs

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.740 
the gap is in the direction of the hairs
growing<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:50.810> my<00:01:50.990> hair<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.890> hair<00:01:51.950> right<00:01:52.190> here

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
growing so my hair this hair right here

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.080 
growing so my hair this hair right here
grows<00:01:53.750> in<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:54.320> direction<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.130> that's<00:01:55.700> where

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
grows in this direction so that's where

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.900 
grows in this direction so that's where
I<00:01:56.120> want<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.540> put<00:01:57.260> there<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.770> could<00:01:57.980> pull<00:01:58.880> it

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
I want to put there so I could pull it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.330 
I want to put there so I could pull it
that<00:01:59.150> way<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.660> way<00:02:00.470> it'll<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:01.310> know

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that way and that way it'll you know

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.550 
that way and that way it'll you know
jerk<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.850> hair<00:02:02.030> out<00:02:02.150> because<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.320> do<00:02:03.380> it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
jerk the hair out because if I do it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.710 
jerk the hair out because if I do it
this<00:02:03.710> way<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:04.640> not<00:02:04.760> going<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> grab<00:02:05.240> anything

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
this way it's not going to grab anything

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.380 
this way it's not going to grab anything
because<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> same<00:02:07.370> direction<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:07.970> we

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
because it's in the same direction so we

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.450 
because it's in the same direction so we
kind<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.960> say<00:02:09.680> sing<00:02:09.920> direction<00:02:10.340> in<00:02:10.399> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
kind of I say sing direction in the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.520 
kind of I say sing direction in the
beginning<00:02:10.760> I<00:02:10.970> meant<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> say<00:02:12.020> opposite

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
beginning I meant to say opposite

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.960 
beginning I meant to say opposite
directions<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> grip<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.580> hair

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
directions so you want to grip the hair

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.640 
directions so you want to grip the hair
in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> opposite<00:02:14.870> direction<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.500> goes

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
in the opposite direction that it goes

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.030 
in the opposite direction that it goes
in<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:17.210> I<00:02:17.570> don't<00:02:18.350> really<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:20.530> much<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.770> pluck

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
in so I don't really have much to pluck

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.910 
in so I don't really have much to pluck
or<00:02:22.370> thread<00:02:23.360> actually<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
or thread actually because this is the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.370 
or thread actually because this is the
second<00:02:25.250> time<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:25.760> video<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:27.140> didn't

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
second time I do this video so it didn't

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.140 
second time I do this video so it didn't
upload<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.830> first<00:02:28.010> time<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.520> let's<00:02:28.910> just

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
upload the first time so let's just

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.420 
upload the first time so let's just
pretend<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.600> have<00:02:29.720> some<00:02:29.900> hair<00:02:30.110> there<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:31.220> hair

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
pretend I have some hair there the hair

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.340 
pretend I have some hair there the hair
