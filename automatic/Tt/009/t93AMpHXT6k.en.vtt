online<00:00:09.440> we've<00:00:10.440> got<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.769> acrylic<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:36.690> seems

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
online we've got the acrylic so it seems

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.040 
online we've got the acrylic so it seems
to<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:37.940> it's<00:00:38.940> fitting<00:00:39.840> together

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to be going well it's fitting together

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.729 
to be going well it's fitting together
quite<00:00:40.530> beautifully<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> work

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
quite beautifully not a lot of work

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.450 
quite beautifully not a lot of work
pretty<00:00:43.739> straightforward<00:00:44.960> instructions<00:00:46.460> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
pretty straightforward instructions this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
pretty straightforward instructions this
is<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.820> dry<00:00:48.090> fitted<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.960> resting<00:00:49.379> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is all dry fitted it's just resting in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
is all dry fitted it's just resting in
place<00:00:50.780> but<00:00:51.780> yeah<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.129> far<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.180> looking<00:00:54.300> good

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
place but yeah so far it's looking good

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.849 
place but yeah so far it's looking good
and<00:00:54.960> feeling<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:57.710> mmm

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and feeling good mmm

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639 
and feeling good mmm
surprisingly<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.879> mean<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.660> lot<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:00.960> simple

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
surprisingly I mean a lot more simple

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.240 
surprisingly I mean a lot more simple
than<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.949> sort<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> imagined<00:01:03.920> it's<00:01:04.920> nothing

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
than I sort of imagined it's nothing

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.570 
than I sort of imagined it's nothing
like<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> wolf<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.900> world-champion<00:01:09.900> car

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
like the wolf but a world-champion car

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
like the wolf but a world-champion car
that's<00:01:11.580> gonna<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> lot<00:01:12.030> different<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that's gonna be a lot different but this

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.570 
that's gonna be a lot different but this
is<00:01:13.560> good<00:01:13.770> practice<00:01:16.909> painting<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
is good practice painting of the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.560 
is good practice painting of the
suspension<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:21.439> just<00:01:22.439> drying<00:01:22.740> off<00:01:23.570> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
suspension that's just drying off it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
suspension that's just drying off it
seems<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.049> drive<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> reckon<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
seems to drive to the right I reckon I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
seems to drive to the right I reckon I
look<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.030> carbon<00:01:27.450> fiber<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
look like carbon fiber I do think it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
look like carbon fiber I do think it
looks<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.150> when<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.420> been

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
looks like but it will do when it's been

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.980 
looks like but it will do when it's been
getting<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> buff<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
getting a little bit of a buff and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
getting a little bit of a buff and
there's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> engine<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:35.400> much<00:01:35.549> difference

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there's the engine not much difference

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.960 
there's the engine not much difference
really<00:01:37.159> painted<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> few<00:01:38.369> bits<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.729> pieces

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
really painted a few bits and pieces

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
really painted a few bits and pieces
still<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> finish<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
still got to finish off you kind of to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.359 
still got to finish off you kind of to
see<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.119> done<00:01:45.149> next

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
see what I can get done next

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
see what I can get done next
now<00:01:47.369> I've<00:01:47.520> painted<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> these<00:01:48.380> matte

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
now I've painted all of these matte

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.690 
now I've painted all of these matte
black<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.880> bit<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.079> gunmetal<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
black with a bit the gunmetal in it I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.719 
black with a bit the gunmetal in it I
don't<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.780> notable<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
don't think that's really notable but I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600 
don't think that's really notable but I
don't<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.180> whether<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:59.280> kind

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
don't know whether you can see the kind

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.709 
don't know whether you can see the kind
of<00:02:00.020> mass<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.380> got<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of mass it's got on it's very it's a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.480 
of mass it's got on it's very it's a
very<00:02:03.960> cold<00:02:04.399> things

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
very cold things

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.460 
very cold things
I<00:02:06.520> don't<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.120> looks<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.420> wet<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.289> wet

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
I don't it looks like wet not wet

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.919 
I don't it looks like wet not wet
cold<00:02:08.770> dry<00:02:09.220> cold<00:02:09.550> but<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.000> get<00:02:10.209> coal<00:02:10.479> dust<00:02:10.690> all

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
cold dry cold but you get coal dust all

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.110 
cold dry cold but you get coal dust all
over<00:02:10.959> your<00:02:11.290> hands<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:12.459> see<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.730> difference

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
over your hands you see the difference

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.699 
over your hands you see the difference
so<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.290> one<00:02:15.030> I've<00:02:16.030> polished<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.260> using<00:02:17.620> my

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
so this one I've polished just using my

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.809 
so this one I've polished just using my
t-shirt<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.370> all<00:02:20.220> something<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.580> lot

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
t-shirt that's all something I do a lot

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.180 
t-shirt that's all something I do a lot
actually<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.569> bit<00:02:23.260> more<00:02:23.410> carbon<00:02:23.890> fiber

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
actually little bit more carbon fiber

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.500 
actually little bit more carbon fiber
rear<00:02:24.550> thing<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.959> works<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:26.440> me

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
rear thing that works for me

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
rear thing that works for me
let<00:02:28.510> me<00:02:28.600> know<00:02:28.720> what<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.989> think<00:02:31.260> started<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
let me know what you think started the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:45.509 
let me know what you think started the
Assembly<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:37.800> suspension<00:02:38.800> unit<00:02:44.459> see<00:02:45.459> how

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
Assembly of the suspension unit see how

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.210 
Assembly of the suspension unit see how
it<00:02:45.670> goes<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.180> suppose<00:02:46.739> bit<00:02:47.739> by<00:02:47.920> bit

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.080 

another<00:02:51.220> quick<00:02:51.519> mock-up<00:02:53.670> quickly<00:02:56.910> talking<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
another quick mock-up quickly talking a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.330 
another quick mock-up quickly talking a
lot<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.360> be<00:02:58.480> done<00:02:59.280> this<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.489> fun

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
lot to be done this is fun

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.570 
lot to be done this is fun
now<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:05.620> dry<00:03:05.830> fits<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.250> some<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.489> the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
now I'm just dry fits of some of the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.270 
now I'm just dry fits of some of the
past<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.810> part<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.350> scoop

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
past you know this is part of the scoop

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.920 
past you know this is part of the scoop
system<00:03:09.730> will<00:03:09.850> suppose<00:03:10.209> whatever<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.720> called

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
system will suppose whatever it's called

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.220 
system will suppose whatever it's called
the<00:03:11.590> aerodynamics<00:03:12.690> which<00:03:13.690> shows<00:03:13.959> how<00:03:14.170> the

the aerodynamics which shows how the

the aerodynamics which shows how the
nose<00:03:14.590> fits<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.220> these<00:03:15.790> actually<00:03:16.180> goes

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
nose fits on these actually goes
