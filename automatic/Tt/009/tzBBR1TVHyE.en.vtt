00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 greetings friends who work here and in the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.219
 Today's video comes with a good video 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.379
 simple very fast 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.970
 There is today, I'm going to open three 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:24.360
 searches and curious functions and if this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 collection left very little here on the channel 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.610
 but a little touching her and the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.669
 logical codes you would have thought 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 to be something good is how you know 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.330
 but for having a certain prejudice 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 This opens the gate with the cards in the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:49.290
 Brazil will be the fact that neither 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.280
 I do not like the amount of letters 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:02.000
 Come here in Brazil, I think you feel. 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.000
 very little but okay with you 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.890
 It's the first step for you. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.549
 Look there, I do not know if you do not 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 get well see the letter because that 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.020
 camera has focus on the user nothing has been 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.740
 done here 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.740
 xix magnetic storm 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.869
 helium pinch this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 the next 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 and I stumble to see these things 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.950
 farmer looks l 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.659
 my code calls for me who took the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.659
 code that got everything else 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.050
 was for you an auction 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.920
 against 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.920
 on basis 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.830

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.540
 Enough of the plot I did not always tell 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.010
 the time I had never seen one 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.819
 shock because in fact the living I 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.850
 I do 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.620
 usually search is just a little thing 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.740
 I was always in the middle at the beginning of my 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.250
 channel was very fair, but then I 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.819
 kind of stopped doing it and so on. 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.939
 stayed here then 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:56.980

 the energy 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:13.700
 It's just her how rare I do not think any 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.700

 no weapon 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.440

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.810
 Even so , nobody's video today. 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.990
