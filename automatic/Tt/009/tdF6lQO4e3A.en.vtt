00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 Well, no 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.130
 good guys the routine is no longer 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.190
 eating and the summer is us 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.140
 ending we can not do anything but 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.430
 have to assume that we have to go back 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.980
 to school to work to college 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.990
 where we have to go back and the best 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.779
 way is to do it with some routines 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.640
 easy is very very adapted and very fast 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.590
 so we do not need too much time 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.180
 with the morning to fix ourselves so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.860
 today I'm going to do a make-up of 5 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.290
 minutes and 5 minutes hairstyle 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.149
 natural and easy but to be fixed 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.100
 and be perfect so if you get up 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.870
 late or you really do not have time for 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.670
 the mornings to devote too much 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.670
 fix this routine is for you 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.130
 to do is going to be the hairstyle we are going to 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.410
 combing all the hair thoroughly to make sure 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.650
 which is unraveled and we take it towards 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.930
 one side creating a streak on one side 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.239
 we put a parador that is to hold it 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.310
 and that all the hair that we have in 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.590
 one of the sides let's curl what 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.740
 creating waves in a random way 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.390
 without asphalting hoist all the hair 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.630
 just make a few strands to give 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.720
 the effect and we're also going to pray in the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.400
 zone 8 if we had bangs or if not 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 you had fringes to curl with a little bit 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.080
 more detail the front area which is what 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.000
 that more serious once we let it 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.600
 cool the hair let's apply a 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 little bit of lacquer 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 yes 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 let's talk with makeup I'll 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.970
 based mostly on small 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.430
 corrections using concealer then 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.170
 let's wrap the area with some powder 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.330
 compact to give a little bit of 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.580
 coverage without being full coverage 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.560
 all over my face then I'm going to return 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.509
 volume and color to the face 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.050
 Outlining and giving a little 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050
 rouge 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.860
 for eye makeup we are also going to 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.870
 do something very simple we will use 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.390
 the fingers let's apply a shadow 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.709
 taupe all over the mobile eyelid 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.629
 then we will give a little light 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.340
 applying in the lacrimal area and 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.470
 we will add a golden pigment on top 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.209
 this brings a lot of light to the eye 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.920
 let's make our tabs and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.420
 then we will apply two formulas 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.609
 different mask to create a 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.780
 much greater effect and as a final touch 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.780
 let's touch up our eyebrows 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.730
 Y 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.390
 Touching your eyebrows is one of the steps 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.040
 important even if you do not have time 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.420
 a little mask and touch the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.420
 eyebrows can do a lot 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 for the lips we are going to go supernatural 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.579
 or you already know that the most intense colors 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.950
 and flashy they need more retouching and 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.780
 let's apply a matte formula that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.970
 fixed to make it much easier to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.970
 I can carry it all day and it's 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.970
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.040
 that you try it already you will see that it is 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.470
 very easy that you are super fixed 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.300
 in no time if you do it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.510
