00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
very high expectations on him so if he's

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.070 
very high expectations on him so if he's
not<00:02:16.670> playing<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.780> know<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.959> other

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
not playing you know the other

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.990 
not playing you know the other
quarterback<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.890> don't<00:02:19.370> think<00:02:19.430> they'll<00:02:19.700> change

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
quarterback I don't think they'll change

once<00:02:20.450> India<00:02:20.780> tags<00:02:21.080> coach<00:02:21.470> strong<00:02:21.800> more<00:02:22.040> about

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
once India tags coach strong more about

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520 
once India tags coach strong more about
it<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.269> think<00:02:23.359> they're<00:02:23.659> very<00:02:23.689> similar<00:02:24.019> type

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
it but I think they're very similar type

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.630 
it but I think they're very similar type
athletes<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.069> are<00:02:25.159> going<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.340> try<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.489> run

the size of the inside guys are in their

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.490 
the size of the inside guys are in their
