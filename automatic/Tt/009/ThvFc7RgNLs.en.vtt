00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
first rule number one is never work out

first rule number one is never work out
on<00:00:14.940> an<00:00:15.059> empty<00:00:15.210> gas<00:00:15.540> tank<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.770> always<00:00:17.070> must

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
on an empty gas tank so you always must

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.710 
on an empty gas tank so you always must
be<00:00:17.430> fueled<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.789> before<00:00:18.060> working<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.480> there

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
be fueled up before working out there

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
be fueled up before working out there
isn't<00:00:19.080> much<00:00:19.199> point<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.710> working<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.310> if

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
isn't much point to working out if

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
isn't much point to working out if
you're<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:20.939> fueled<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.260> you're

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you're not fueled up and if you're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.650 
you're not fueled up and if you're
really<00:00:22.650> lacking<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.310> energy<00:00:23.519> because<00:00:24.510> your

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
really lacking in energy because your

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.880 
really lacking in energy because your
workout<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.529> bad<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
workout is going to be really bad and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
workout is going to be really bad and
you<00:00:25.980> might<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.279> well<00:00:26.400> not<00:00:26.519> even<00:00:26.580> work<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.119> but

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you might as well not even work out but

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.150 
you might as well not even work out but
you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.439> something<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:28.890> body

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
to work out and to the analogy I like to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
to work out and to the analogy I like to
use<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.969> wouldn't<00:00:33.149> drive<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.450> car

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
use is that you wouldn't drive your car

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
use is that you wouldn't drive your car
and<00:00:34.079> drag<00:00:34.410> race<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:34.920> empty<00:00:35.160> gas<00:00:35.399> tank<00:00:35.610> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and drag race with an empty gas tank you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
and drag race with an empty gas tank you
want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.780> some<00:00:36.930> gas<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.380> tank<00:00:37.530> um<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
want to have some gas in the tank um be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.990 
want to have some gas in the tank um be
filled<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> great

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
workout and have optimal performance so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.279 
workout and have optimal performance so
never<00:00:42.719> work<00:00:42.899> out<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.440> empty<00:00:43.590> stomach<00:00:43.940> and

never work out on an empty stomach and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
never work out on an empty stomach and
number<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
number two you also don't want to have

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
number two you also don't want to have
big<00:00:47.789> meals<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> never<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> eat<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> big

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

because if you eat a big meal you heard

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.459 
because if you eat a big meal you heard
it<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.360> before<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.079> cramps

digesting<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> Bloods<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.899> rushing

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
digesting all the Bloods of me rushing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.889 
digesting all the Bloods of me rushing
towards<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.550> stomach<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> help<00:01:03.210> digest<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
towards the stomach to help digest and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
towards the stomach to help digest and
break<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.650> food<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.519> won't<00:01:05.700> be

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
break down the food and it won't be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
break down the food and it won't be
focused<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.630> muscles<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.290> anything<00:01:07.830> like

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
focused on your muscles or anything like

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
focused on your muscles or anything like
that<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.790> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> eat<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> big

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that so if you are going to eat a big

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
that so if you are going to eat a big
meal<00:01:09.750> try<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> eat<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.650> least<00:01:10.799> 60<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> 90

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
meal try to eat it at least 60 in the 90

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
meal try to eat it at least 60 in the 90
minutes<00:01:11.790> before<00:01:12.060> working<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.840> prefer

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
minutes before working out I prefer

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
minutes before working out I prefer
around<00:01:13.979> 90<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.630> anything<00:01:15.900> eat

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
around 90 and do not anything eat

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
around 90 and do not anything eat
anything<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.770> harder<00:01:17.070> than<00:01:17.189> Jess<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
anything that's harder than Jess so this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
anything that's harder than Jess so this
also<00:01:17.970> goes<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.509> big<00:01:18.659> meal<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.439> you're

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
also goes with the big meal so if you're
