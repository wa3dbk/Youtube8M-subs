no more traffic at all okay we do the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.870 
no more traffic at all okay we do the
sidewalks<00:00:30.169> so<00:00:31.169> they're<00:00:31.410> longer<00:00:31.650> lasting<00:00:32.310> okay

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
sidewalks so they're longer lasting okay

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.110 
sidewalks so they're longer lasting okay
and<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.990> morn<00:00:34.230> budging<00:00:34.800> okay<00:00:35.370> along<00:00:36.090> with

and the morn budging okay along with

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
and the morn budging okay along with
some<00:00:36.480> lighting<00:00:36.780> okay<00:00:37.550> more<00:00:38.550> plantings<00:00:39.180> okay

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
some lighting okay more plantings okay

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.400 
some lighting okay more plantings okay
like<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.620> trees<00:00:40.890> around<00:00:41.310> right<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:42.410> yeah

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
like the trees around right now yeah

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.710 
like the trees around right now yeah
more<00:00:43.680> trees<00:00:43.890> would<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.190> great<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.790> get<00:00:44.970> on

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
more trees would be great they get on

00:00:45.720 --> 00:01:02.680 
more trees would be great they get on
the<00:00:45.810> bus<00:00:45.990> okay<00:00:47.540> sometimes<00:00:48.540> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.570> office

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.390 

north

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.930 

place<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.670> middle<00:01:10.909> yeah<00:01:12.790> i<00:01:15.640> think<00:01:16.640> there's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
place in the middle yeah i think there's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.900 
place in the middle yeah i think there's
always<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.630> lack<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.380> seedy<00:01:18.770> places<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.760> gather

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
always a lack of seedy places to gather

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.230 
always a lack of seedy places to gather
on<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.500> everywhere<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:22.729> sit<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.090> either

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
on so everywhere you can sit it either

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.050 
on so everywhere you can sit it either
like<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.510> private<00:01:24.020> cafe

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
like a private cafe

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.569 
like a private cafe
and<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:25.509> there's<00:01:25.720> very<00:01:26.020> very<00:01:26.140> few<00:01:26.579> public

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
and then there's very very few public

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.429 
and then there's very very few public
benches<00:01:28.030> or<00:01:28.090> more<00:01:28.600> places<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.079> sit<00:01:29.380> on

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
benches or more places to sit on

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.969 
benches or more places to sit on
Flanders<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.520> think<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:32.470> something<00:01:32.740> that

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
Flanders so I think is something that

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.700 
Flanders so I think is something that
will<00:01:33.159> be<00:01:33.250> really<00:01:33.549> good<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:34.000> have<00:01:34.470> maybe<00:01:35.470> some

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
will be really good to have maybe some

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
will be really good to have maybe some
more<00:01:35.799> open<00:01:36.159> space<00:01:36.310> where<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:36.789> could<00:01:37.000> have

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
more open space where you could have

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.630 
more open space where you could have
mixed<00:01:38.259> use<00:01:38.439> of<00:01:38.680> them

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
mixed use of them

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.360 
mixed use of them
would<00:01:39.820> be<00:01:39.909> really<00:01:40.090> nice<00:01:40.530> well<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.890> skyways

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
would be really nice well the skyways

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.860 
would be really nice well the skyways
are<00:01:42.520> really<00:01:42.729> successful<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.600> lot<00:01:43.810> of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
are really successful here and a lot of

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.100 
are really successful here and a lot of
people<00:01:44.110> like<00:01:44.200> them<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.740> personally<00:01:45.610> don't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
people like them I personally don't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.600 
people like them I personally don't
because<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.140> actually<00:01:47.440> distracts<00:01:48.130> from<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
because it actually distracts from the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.969 
because it actually distracts from the
mall<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.240> mystery<00:01:49.990> life<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:50.680> if<00:01:50.770> there's<00:01:50.920> a

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
mall and mystery life so if there's a

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.260 
mall and mystery life so if there's a
way<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.100> integrate<00:01:51.369> those<00:01:51.700> little<00:01:51.970> bit<00:01:52.090> more

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
way to integrate those little bit more

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.510 
way to integrate those little bit more
and<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.619> think<00:01:53.800> people<00:01:53.920> when<00:01:54.220> you're<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.490> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
and I think people when you're on the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.160 
and I think people when you're on the
street<00:01:54.729> or<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.570> skyway<00:01:55.840> there's

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
street or in this in the skyway there's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.320 
street or in this in the skyway there's
such<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.380> disconnect<00:01:56.590> between<00:01:56.860> them<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:58.150> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
such a disconnect between them that the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.999 
such a disconnect between them that the
Skyway<00:01:58.690> doesn't<00:01:58.990> really<00:01:59.110> follow<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.800> stream

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
Skyway doesn't really follow the stream

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.350 
Skyway doesn't really follow the stream
pattern<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.550> street<00:02:00.759> at<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.030> doesn't<00:02:01.240> follow

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
pattern the street at it doesn't follow

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.420 
pattern the street at it doesn't follow
the<00:02:01.509> Skyway<00:02:01.840> system<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.440> if<00:02:03.009> there's<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.280> little

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
the Skyway system so if there's a little

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.620 
the Skyway system so if there's a little
bit<00:02:03.580> more<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:06.520> transparency<00:02:06.880> between<00:02:07.360> how

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
bit more like transparency between how

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.020 
bit more like transparency between how
to<00:02:07.690> get<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.110> one<00:02:08.619> or<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.800> other<00:02:08.830> or<00:02:09.069> that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
to get to one or the other or that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.400 
to get to one or the other or that
they're<00:02:10.179> aligned<00:02:10.479> with<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:10.959> connection

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
they're aligned with like connection

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:49.290 
they're aligned with like connection
points<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.860> think<00:02:11.980> would<00:02:12.100> be<00:02:12.190> really<00:02:12.220> nice

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.360 

you
