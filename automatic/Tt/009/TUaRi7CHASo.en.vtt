because<00:02:14.650> he<00:02:14.980> would<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.220> arguments<00:02:15.790> that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
because he would have arguments that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.160 
because he would have arguments that
nobody<00:02:16.480> else<00:02:16.660> has

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
nobody else has
I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.620> most<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.220> companies

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
I think that the most of the companies

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.960 
I think that the most of the companies
and<00:02:22.330> their<00:02:23.100> scientists<00:02:24.100> working<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.550> them

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and their scientists working for them

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.360 
and their scientists working for them
obviously<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.290> an<00:02:26.470> interest<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.160> say

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
obviously it is it an interest to say

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.120 
obviously it is it an interest to say
that<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:28.300> absolutely<00:02:29.110> safe<00:02:29.320> because<00:02:29.739> they<00:02:30.100> are

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that is absolutely safe because they are

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.729 
that is absolutely safe because they are
