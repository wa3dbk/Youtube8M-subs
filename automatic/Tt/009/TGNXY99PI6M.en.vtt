we're probably all like we're not going
to<00:03:36.130> get<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> breaking<00:03:36.520> wave<00:03:36.700> or<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.090> little<00:03:37.300> bit

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
to get a breaking wave or a little bit

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.970 
to get a breaking wave or a little bit
away<00:03:37.540> from<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:37.750> reefs<00:03:38.050> but<00:03:38.290> I'll<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.800> keep

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
away from that reefs but I'll just keep

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.070 
away from that reefs but I'll just keep
the<00:03:39.160> boat<00:03:39.310> coming<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.570> score<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:40.930> keep

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
the boat coming so that score can keep

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.950 
the boat coming so that score can keep
the<00:03:41.170> pressure<00:03:41.410> on<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.740> fish<00:03:42.870> well<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
the pressure on that fish well the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.630 
the pressure on that fish well the
official<00:03:44.410> swing<00:03:44.620> boards<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.980> boat<00:03:45.160> it's<00:03:45.400> really

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
official swing boards a boat it's really

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.210 
official swing boards a boat it's really
hard<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.910> keep<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.710> attention<00:03:47.710> on<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.040> line

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
hard to keep the attention on the line

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.220 
hard to keep the attention on the line
they<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.520> throw<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.850> lure<00:03:48.970> or<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.270> boat<00:03:52.230> so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
they can throw the lure or the boat so

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.080 
they can throw the lure or the boat so
let's<00:03:53.380> go<00:03:53.530> tell<00:03:53.770> us<00:03:53.890> about<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.130> braid<00:03:54.550> with<00:03:54.850> a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
let's go tell us about that braid with a

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.340 
let's go tell us about that braid with a
bit<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.390> different<00:03:55.690> combination<00:03:55.870> there

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
bit of a different combination there

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.560 
bit of a different combination there
with<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> TV<00:03:56.710> off<00:03:57.150> yeah

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
with the TV off yeah

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.560 
with the TV off yeah
so<00:03:58.930> I'm<00:03:59.610> one<00:04:00.610> big<00:04:00.640> tech<00:04:00.940> support<00:04:01.300> and<00:04:01.420> press

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
so I'm one big tech support and press

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.750 
so I'm one big tech support and press
they<00:04:01.690> don't<00:04:01.840> normally<00:04:02.140> troll<00:04:02.350> braid<00:04:02.760> but

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
they don't normally troll braid but

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.730 
they don't normally troll braid but
that's<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> honey

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
that's the honey

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.630 
that's the honey
probably<00:04:05.740> the<00:04:05.800> only<00:04:05.890> way<00:04:06.100> I'll<00:04:06.220> do<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.430> with

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
probably the only way I'll do it with

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.210 
probably the only way I'll do it with
these<00:04:06.760> venom<00:04:07.090> rods<00:04:07.500> cuz<00:04:08.500> they're<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:08.770> soft<00:04:09.010> in

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
these venom rods cuz they're so soft in

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.090 
these venom rods cuz they're so soft in
the<00:04:09.310> taper<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:10.210> so<00:04:10.390> much<00:04:10.540> power<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.800> pieces

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
the taper it's so much power this pieces

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.530 
the taper it's so much power this pieces
give<00:04:12.250> me<00:04:12.340> no<00:04:12.460> problem<00:04:12.760> at<00:04:12.820> all<00:04:12.910> but<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.420> it

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
give me no problem at all but and it

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.450 
give me no problem at all but and it
allows<00:04:13.720> us<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.170> use<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.380> smaller<00:04:14.830> real<00:04:15.160> light

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
allows us to use a smaller real light

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.250 
allows us to use a smaller real light
like<00:04:15.760> these<00:04:16.000> tip<00:04:16.209> you're<00:04:16.360> on<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.630> speed<00:04:16.989> reals

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
like these tip you're on to speed reals

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.870 
like these tip you're on to speed reals
because<00:04:17.590> we<00:04:17.709> can<00:04:17.860> get<00:04:18.040> more<00:04:18.220> light<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.459> cuz<00:04:18.760> of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
because we can get more light on cuz of

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.490 
because we can get more light on cuz of
the<00:04:18.940> fauna<00:04:19.150> diameter<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> braid<00:04:20.080> they're

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
the fauna diameter of the braid they're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.780 
the fauna diameter of the braid they're
much<00:04:20.620> more<00:04:20.799> comfortable<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.340> fish<00:04:21.580> with<00:04:21.760> you

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
much more comfortable to fish with you

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.250 
much more comfortable to fish with you
know<00:04:22.950> during<00:04:23.950> your<00:04:24.100> hand<00:04:27.720> but<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.750> do<00:04:29.020> use<00:04:29.230> a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
know during your hand but you do use a

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.660 
know during your hand but you do use a
different<00:04:29.680> leader<00:04:29.830> combination<00:04:30.490> with<00:04:30.580> the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
different leader combination with the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.310 
different leader combination with the
braid<00:04:30.880> don't<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.360> yeah<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.660> saw<00:04:32.730> probably<00:04:34.320> 10

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
braid don't you yeah you saw probably 10

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320 
braid don't you yeah you saw probably 10
meters<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:35.950> potent<00:04:36.340> formula<00:04:36.850> later<00:04:37.210> we

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
meters of that potent formula later we

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.430 
meters of that potent formula later we
saw<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.670> give<00:04:39.820> yourself<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.570> little<00:04:41.230> bit

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
saw just to give yourself a little bit

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.279 
saw just to give yourself a little bit
of<00:04:41.560> give<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.860> night

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
of give you night

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.320 
of give you night
I<00:04:43.379> haven't<00:04:44.219> got<00:04:44.339> quite<00:04:44.550> that<00:04:44.789> much<00:04:44.939> on<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
I haven't got quite that much on that

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.850 
I haven't got quite that much on that
road<00:04:45.539> but<00:04:45.749> I<00:04:45.779> think<00:04:45.869> there's<00:04:46.169> about<00:04:46.259> three<00:04:46.740> or

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
road but I think there's about three or

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.779 
road but I think there's about three or
four<00:04:47.039> meters<00:04:47.279> on<00:04:47.550> there<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:49.490> he'll<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> road

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
four meters on there so he'll the road

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.619 
four meters on there so he'll the road
compensates<00:04:51.389> for<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.629> as<00:04:51.749> well<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:53.629> just

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
compensates for that as well I just

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:55.999 
compensates for that as well I just
bumped<00:04:54.839> that<00:04:54.930> drag<00:04:55.199> back<00:04:55.409> a<00:04:55.439> fraction<00:04:55.919> when

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
bumped that drag back a fraction when

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.950 
bumped that drag back a fraction when
the<00:04:56.099> fish<00:04:56.249> gets<00:04:56.460> near<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.729> boat<00:04:56.879> yeah<00:04:57.449> he

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
the fish gets near the boat yeah he

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.689 
the fish gets near the boat yeah he
hasn't<00:04:58.199> done<00:04:58.259> a<00:04:58.319> lot<00:04:58.529> of<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:59.360> lot<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.479> work<00:05:01.699> we

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
hasn't done a lot of a lot of work we

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:03.980 
hasn't done a lot of a lot of work we
have<00:05:02.789> another<00:05:02.969> run<00:05:03.180> here<00:05:03.360> in<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.509> moment

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
have another run here in a moment

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.749 
have another run here in a moment
oh<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.740> can<00:05:04.860> tell<00:05:05.039> when<00:05:05.189> he<00:05:05.279> hit<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.520> he<00:05:05.639> was

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
oh you can tell when he hit it he was

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.100 
oh you can tell when he hit it he was
sort<00:05:05.999> of<00:05:06.059> the<00:05:06.119> right<00:05:06.300> species<00:05:06.659> couldn't

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
sort of the right species couldn't

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.549 
sort of the right species couldn't
happen<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.649> think<00:05:08.219> I<00:05:08.399> love<00:05:08.580> hitchhikes<00:05:09.029> huh
