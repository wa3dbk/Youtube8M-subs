00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
bracket for it to get it to stand
horizontally<00:02:10.810> high<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.320> made<00:02:12.040> an<00:02:12.190> attempt<00:02:12.550> at

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
horizontally high I made an attempt at

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.949 
horizontally high I made an attempt at
building<00:02:12.790> an<00:02:13.030> oscillating<00:02:13.450> spindle<00:02:13.750> sander

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
building an oscillating spindle sander

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:14.559 
building an oscillating spindle sander
that

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
that

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.949 
that
yeah<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.500> didn't<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.610> worked<00:02:16.879> but<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.780> know

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
yeah you didn't it worked but you know

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.000 
yeah you didn't it worked but you know
no<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.500> didn't<00:02:18.799> work<00:02:18.829> anyways<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.510> is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
no it didn't work anyways that one is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.949 
no it didn't work anyways that one is
half<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:25.760> given<00:02:26.060> my<00:02:26.209> choice<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.659> a<00:02:26.780> my

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
half and I think given my choice of a my

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.990 
half and I think given my choice of a my
I'll<00:02:27.200> probably<00:02:27.439> start<00:02:28.010> with<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.370> half<00:02:28.640> and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
I'll probably start with the half and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.710 
I'll probably start with the half and
see<00:02:29.870> how<00:02:30.049> she<00:02:30.109> does<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.480> not

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
see how she does and then if it's not

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.110 
see how she does and then if it's not
enough<00:02:32.989> maybe<00:02:33.230> I'll<00:02:33.470> upgrade<00:02:33.909> downside<00:02:34.909> is

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
enough maybe I'll upgrade downside is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.069 
enough maybe I'll upgrade downside is
it's<00:02:35.329> another<00:02:35.540> slower<00:02:35.900> motor<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.930> where

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
it's another slower motor this is where

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.379 
it's another slower motor this is where
I'm<00:02:39.170> thinking<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.590> putting<00:02:39.859> it<00:02:39.950> it's<00:02:40.790> nice

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
I'm thinking of putting it it's nice

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.789 
I'm thinking of putting it it's nice
I've<00:02:41.629> got<00:02:43.299> shop<00:02:44.299> lights<00:02:44.599> directly<00:02:45.200> above<00:02:45.680> it

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
I've got shop lights directly above it

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.240 
I've got shop lights directly above it
which<00:02:46.760> ought<00:02:46.939> to<00:02:46.970> help<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.989> keep<00:02:48.859> it<00:02:49.040> down

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
which ought to help I can keep it down

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.839 
which ought to help I can keep it down
from<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.470> jointer<00:02:51.470> there<00:02:51.829> this<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.519> where<00:02:52.700> my

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
from the jointer there this is where my

from the jointer there this is where my
chops<00:02:53.150> are<00:02:53.389> normally<00:02:53.750> sits<00:02:54.049> but<00:02:54.919> I<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.549> figure

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
chops are normally sits but I I figure

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.339 
chops are normally sits but I I figure
if<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.209> do<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.359> little<00:02:56.480> better<00:02:56.659> job<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.200> dust

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
if I do a little better job and dust

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.949 
if I do a little better job and dust

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
collecting on the chop saw that I can

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.020 
collecting on the chop saw that I can

I<00:04:35.380> know<00:04:35.669> it's<00:04:36.669> not<00:04:36.819> the<00:04:37.030> best

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
I know it's not the best

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.920 
I know it's not the best
like<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:39.020> said<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.710> only<00:04:40.099> need<00:04:40.699> this<00:04:40.819> thing<00:04:41.030> to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
turn the legs for the parts scattered

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.269 
turn the legs for the parts scattered
all<00:04:45.139> over

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279 
all over

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:51.050 
all over
for<00:04:46.879> that<00:04:46.999> sideboard

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.120 

yeah<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.660> have<00:04:51.780> no<00:04:51.930> idea<00:04:52.170> maybe<00:04:52.560> I'll<00:04:52.800> find<00:04:53.040> a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
yeah I have no idea maybe I'll find a

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.010 
yeah I have no idea maybe I'll find a
whole<00:04:53.250> bunch<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:53.700> this<00:04:53.850> fork<00:04:54.180> but<00:04:54.420> really

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
whole bunch of use this fork but really

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.710 
whole bunch of use this fork but really
it's<00:04:55.140> only<00:04:55.290> here<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:56.210> does<00:04:57.210> seem<00:04:57.480> to

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
it's only here for that does seem to

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.010 
it's only here for that does seem to
work<00:04:58.350> okay<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.420> I<00:05:00.420> don't<00:05:00.570> even<00:05:00.750> think<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
work okay and I don't even think the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:11.320 
work okay and I don't even think the
bearings<00:05:02.960> need<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.140> replaced

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.589 

a<00:05:11.419> change<00:05:12.139> that<00:05:12.379> I<00:05:12.470> found<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.770> half<00:05:12.949> horse<00:05:13.220> motor

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
a change that I found a half horse motor

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.279 
a change that I found a half horse motor
out<00:05:14.599> in<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:14.870> barn

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
out in the barn

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.649 
out in the barn
I<00:05:15.319> changed<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.009> pulley<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.610> because<00:05:16.970> the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
I changed the pulley on it because the

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.459 
I changed the pulley on it because the
speed<00:05:17.930> went<00:05:18.229> from<00:05:18.789> wow<00:05:19.789> that's<00:05:20.150> too<00:05:20.419> fast<00:05:20.689> all

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
speed went from wow that's too fast all

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.800 
speed went from wow that's too fast all
the<00:05:21.590> way<00:05:21.680> up<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:22.039> sweet<00:05:22.879> Jesus<00:05:23.330> how<00:05:23.539> does<00:05:23.719> it

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
the way up to sweet Jesus how does it

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.550 
the way up to sweet Jesus how does it
stay<00:05:23.990> together<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.370> changed<00:05:25.909> it<00:05:26.060> to<00:05:26.090> that

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
stay together so I changed it to that

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.580 
stay together so I changed it to that
which<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.770> simply<00:05:28.280> one<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.520> had<00:05:28.939> around<00:05:29.509> for<00:05:30.500> the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
which is simply one I had around for the

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.659 
which is simply one I had around for the
lowest<00:05:30.800> setting<00:05:31.250> it<00:05:32.110> looks<00:05:33.110> okay<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:34.099> me<00:05:34.310> I

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
lowest setting it looks okay to me I

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.129 
lowest setting it looks okay to me I
need<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.479> I<00:05:36.400> need<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.520> get<00:05:37.729> one<00:05:37.939> tail<00:05:38.479> stock<00:05:38.780> and

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
need to I need to get one tail stock and

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.409 
need to I need to get one tail stock and
then<00:05:39.259> I<00:05:39.289> don't<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.979> don't<00:05:40.400> have<00:05:40.610> any<00:05:40.819> leg<00:05:41.090> tools

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
then I don't I don't have any leg tools

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.790 
then I don't I don't have any leg tools
so<00:05:43.479> it'll<00:05:44.479> be<00:05:44.629> a<00:05:44.659> little<00:05:44.840> while<00:05:45.139> before<00:05:45.169> I<00:05:45.680> get

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
so it'll be a little while before I get

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.640 
so it'll be a little while before I get
a<00:05:45.949> chance<00:05:46.009> to<00:05:46.310> make<00:05:46.520> any<00:05:46.699> mess<00:05:46.969> with<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:48.229> at

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
a chance to make any mess with it and at

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.830 
a chance to make any mess with it and at
the<00:05:48.710> moment<00:05:48.969> it's<00:05:49.969> really<00:05:50.090> just<00:05:50.539> sort<00:05:50.719> of

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
the moment it's really just sort of

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.040 
the moment it's really just sort of
sitting<00:05:51.110> here<00:05:51.229> so<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.599> might<00:05:53.599> have<00:05:53.629> to<00:05:53.810> tie<00:05:54.020> it

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
sitting here so I might have to tie it

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.189 
sitting here so I might have to tie it
to<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.289> floor<00:05:54.560> in<00:05:55.129> order<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.490> use<00:05:55.639> it<00:05:55.819> but<00:05:56.780> this

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
to the floor in order to use it but this

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.070 
to the floor in order to use it but this
should<00:05:57.500> do<00:05:57.729> what<00:05:58.729> I<00:05:58.759> needed<00:05:59.030> to<00:05:59.150> do<00:06:02.050> got<00:06:03.050> a

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
should do what I needed to do got a

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.980 
should do what I needed to do got a
switch<00:06:03.379> in<00:06:03.529> the<00:06:03.620> cord<00:06:03.889> which<00:06:04.699> isn't

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
switch in the cord which isn't

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.409 
switch in the cord which isn't
particularly<00:06:05.990> good<00:06:06.229> and<00:06:06.440> I<00:06:07.159> have<00:06:07.430> an<00:06:07.819> indexing

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
particularly good and I have an indexing

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.279 
particularly good and I have an indexing
head<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:09.529> that<00:06:09.560> ought<00:06:09.770> to<00:06:09.800> work<00:06:09.889> nice<00:06:11.289> thanks

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
head so that ought to work nice thanks
