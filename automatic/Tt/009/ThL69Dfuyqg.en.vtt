00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
open up your bottle it's got a little

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.039 
open up your bottle it's got a little
foil<00:02:00.549> wrap<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.600> top<00:02:03.210> peel<00:02:04.210> that<00:02:04.360> away<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.899> can

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
foil wrap on top peel that away you can

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.749 
foil wrap on top peel that away you can
use<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:07.050> funnel<00:02:08.050> if<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:08.289> want<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.610> we're

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
use a a funnel if you want but we're

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.350 
use a a funnel if you want but we're
just<00:02:09.789> going<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.060> add<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.390> right<00:02:11.819> there<00:02:15.360> until

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
just going to add it right there until

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.750 
just going to add it right there until
the<00:02:16.959> level<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.470> between<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.040> lines<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.610> we're

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the level is between the lines so we're

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
the level is between the lines so we're
just<00:02:18.790> carefully<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.600> we<00:02:19.630> don't<00:02:19.690> spill<00:02:20.050> much

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.550 

and<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:25.180> silver<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.959> see<00:02:26.200> through<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.470> so

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
and the silver you can see through it so

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.770 
and the silver you can see through it so
you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.769> watch<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.220> level<00:02:27.489> go<00:02:27.610> up<00:02:27.780> almost

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
you can watch the level go up almost

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.890 
you can watch the level go up almost
there<00:02:29.850> okay<00:02:30.850> we're<00:02:31.030> at<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.150> upper<00:02:31.480> limit<00:02:31.600> now

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
there okay we're at the upper limit now

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.890 
there okay we're at the upper limit now
so<00:02:32.500> I'm<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.890> stop<00:02:33.600> we're<00:02:34.600> gonna<00:02:34.720> save

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
so I'm going to stop we're gonna save

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.220 
so I'm going to stop we're gonna save
this<00:02:35.049> for<00:02:35.230> later<00:02:36.540> I've<00:02:37.540> had<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.840> car<00:02:38.049> for<00:02:38.080> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
this for later I've had this car for a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.570 
this for later I've had this car for a
couple<00:02:38.500> years<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> first<00:02:39.280> time<00:02:39.430> I've

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
couple years it's the first time I've

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.720 
couple years it's the first time I've
added<00:02:39.760> power<00:02:40.030> steering<00:02:40.420> fluid<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:42.040> does<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
added power steering fluid so it does it

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.850 
added power steering fluid so it does it
is<00:02:43.060> consumable<00:02:43.600> at<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> very<00:02:44.080> slow<00:02:44.319> rate<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.799> you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
is consumable at a very slow rate so you

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.410 
is consumable at a very slow rate so you
need<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.130> check<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.459> every<00:02:45.610> now<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:45.940> but

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
need to check it every now and in but

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.720 
need to check it every now and in but
again<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.690> tell-tale<00:02:46.930> sign<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.130> wine<00:02:48.430> or

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
again the tell-tale sign is the wine or

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.070 
again the tell-tale sign is the wine or
though<00:02:48.850> or<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.269> home<00:02:49.450> when<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.810> start

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
though or the home when you start

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660 
though or the home when you start
turning<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.380> wheel<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.799> shows<00:02:51.459> you're<00:02:51.640> a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
turning the wheel that shows you're a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.690 
turning the wheel that shows you're a
little<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:51.970> low<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.239> power<00:02:52.390> steering<00:02:52.780> fluid

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
little bit low on power steering fluid

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.180 
little bit low on power steering fluid
so<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:54.880> all<00:02:55.030> there<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.950> that's<00:02:56.950> how

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
so that's all there is to it that's how

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.130 
so that's all there is to it that's how
you<00:02:57.220> service<00:02:57.819> power<00:02:58.209> steering<00:02:58.630> fluid<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:59.109> a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
you service power steering fluid on a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.380 
you service power steering fluid on a
