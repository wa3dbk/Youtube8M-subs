00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.990
 Mr. Jesus, do not take our 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.480
 sins but the faith of your people and 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:14.089
 according to your word grant peace 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:25.520
 and the unity to you that you live queens and we 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:27.920
 love for centuries of the centuries how many 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.600
 people live in life then you know not 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.059
 there is a census put not listed in the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.519
 Nicolaus map to go out and I advise that 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.679
 you put the bone the people who live 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.969
 now here are the ones that first go to 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.920
 occupy departments when you 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.050
 build the germ neither of the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.089
 builder and the municipality is 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.719
 social worker for how many years 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.719
 is the house here 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 it's a war between them we can not 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.800
 put more than ten years ago I 'm 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.810
 illegally occupying a work that no 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.720
 government ended if we do not want us 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:06.330
 happen the same thing we have to do something already 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:09.260
 that the frustration and anger that he wants 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.260
 that we support a violent take 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.060
 it's crazy , I thought it's our 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.570
 priest work which one knows very well 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570
 what am i talking about 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.899
 I want to know if you are able to stay at 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.899
 front of this parish 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.200
 we never went there not somewhere else a 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.939
 priest did not negotiate with 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.520
 drug traffickers I did not go to negotiate 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.079
 seven and ten all the decisions that 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.850
 we take can harm a task that 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 it is much more important than all 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.240
 we are together 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.250
 in a situation like this we can not 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.990
 be only priests 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 or you think that it's easy for me to come 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.880
 here every day have no idea what 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.159
 is 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.149
 I did not choose to be here 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.149
 I can not just 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 the violence of yesterday is not the same as 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.640
 Today's 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.640
 but our love is the same
