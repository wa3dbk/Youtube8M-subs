00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.990
 and salvation to all and to all his 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.580
 goblins I hope you're fine so 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.410
 we find ourselves today for a small 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.200
 comments harry who comment harry on 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.570
 call of duty dose time mm on the map 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.980
 whiteout so the particularity of the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.739
 gameplay is that it is a 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.910
 gameplay on xbox one so yes I do 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.730
 part of the lucky ones who had the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.260
 console for output 1 so I'm 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.199
 really really happy and for the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.600
 moment not disappointed to have had this console 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.050
 so that's the small thing 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.729
 introduction so guys I will you 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.229
 give my first impressions so 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.150
 it's warm-weather impressions 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 like that on the first two days of 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.110
 the output of this console for the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.560
 moment is what are we going to say good in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.700
 his whole on the console itself 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.950
 why on the console and not on the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 game bah because on the game I have I 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 still do not see dedicated servers 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.490
 so we'll wait a little bit before 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.110
 to spit on infinity ward 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.299
 of activity since I heard 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 that it is this famous oath dedicated 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.870
 should go out one at the time of launch 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.850
 from the ps4 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.960
 so I say I heard I say 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.140
 think with tweezers because we do not 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.180
 never know so we'll wait and we'll 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.160
 see one as we say wait and see 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.660
 we'll see the only thing for the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 moment when I'm embarrassed when I play 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.220
 call of on this type box one this is the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.090
 joystick one the joystick that is fine 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.890
 frankly very well in its entirety 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.230
 except when I dyed knives 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.910
 actually launch the rb button I do not 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.970
 is really far from the joystick that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.100
 speak at 3.6 and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 in fact when I press the button I 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.810
 automatically mounts no joystick in 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.300
 done so I have not especially a good 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 shoot is not going to see a show we will say 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.600
 downright disgusting 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.920
 I really have trouble fitting the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 enemies but otherwise it's really 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520
 the only downside there is for the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.720
 moment 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.270
 after me, I still have enough 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.060
 will say stunned the performance of 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.500
 of the console when I say that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 console performance but it takes 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.050
 know that when you start the game in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.350
 do you can get started 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.000
 sokolov admit and just come back 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.530
 on the interface without leaving 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.150
 the game in fact you will continue to 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.350
 look for your party and you go 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.959
 can admit to go on 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 Skype application on TV all that 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.959
 and do all that while you 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.180
 look for a part you can even 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.480
 watch TV while you play 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.730
 call of so that I find it anyway 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
 it's not enough 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.959
 it's not that it's abused but it's 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.580
 quite impressive in terms of 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.459
 performance for the console because it 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.840
 there is no there is no console 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.340
 you do not have to do that, that's what 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.690
 I mean myself, thankfully 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.100
 brothel price we will say that like that 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.989
 so here is a little bit for what is 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.640
 my first impressions of the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.280
 console that are really for the moment 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.320

 easy to enter only on bo 2 we do not have 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.610
 still quite the technique even though 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.900
 one afternoon we were really serious 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.729
 hot and we got some kills 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.260

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.280

 of course and then next I 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.690
 also wanted to talk to you about the top 5 and 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.280
 so we know we're going 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.669
 preparing yourself so you 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.889
 to prepare 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.740
 there is everything that is gfx publisher that 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.500
 are preparing the intros 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.940
 for the tops 5 abolished so here you are 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.380
 will do I think a video much more 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.590
 complete really to explain you to 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.030
 who to send us your clips 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.650
 a little later but for the moment 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.360
 know that we saw in comments 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.580
 that would interest you that that you 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.770
 would like so we noted it we take it in 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.200
 account and we will really get you out 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.580
 I think pretty quickly so I think 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.170
 only for the first top 5 1 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.540
 it will be call of duty call of duty 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.830
 gosta I advance is a little bit in 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.320
 saying that but I think it will remain 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.670
 on call of duty kid 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.470
 so here we will make you a pretty video 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.390
 complete with that with an address for 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.680
 send us the link clips I think 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.560
 that we wanted to hit the aude have 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.320
 listed all that to know as small 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.270
 parenthesis on the top 5 1 that my 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.600
 colleagues asked imperatively 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.130
 to pour a capture material 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.630
 which is really much more practical 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.280
 since there is no studio 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.660
 on this call of duty plust even on xbox 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.640
 one for the moment there is no 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.680
 studio so that's a little parenthesis 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.170
 finished we will go back to the top 5 so a 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.780
 little top 5 to bollée only for the 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.370
