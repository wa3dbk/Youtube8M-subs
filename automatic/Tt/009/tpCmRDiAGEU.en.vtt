00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.530
 very tasty and easy to make 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.530
 balanced Chico 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
 So sweet, what are we going to do today? 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.430
 balanced boy and the ingredients that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.910
 we're going to use soy is 2 liters of milk 4 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 corn starch spoons maize six 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.030
 eggs six cups sugar and half a lemon 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.410
 cut 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.110
 so we're going to have the first 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.020
 step of the sweet that is to use is two cups 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 of sugar for us to caramelize the form 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 of the boy announced 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 Let's put it here to caramelize while 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.199
 the super melts we will put the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.210
 milk to warm 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.080
 then the two liters of milk goes 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080
 put on that singing 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 from here we will wait to caramelize the sugar 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 so here we have already melted sugar 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 for the shirt 'the boy's shape 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.890
 balanced 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.560
 Let's put it the way we will 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.869
 channeling form and booking is now the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.330
 People are going to go for the cream of a boy. 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.119
 announced that we will use six eggs 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.369
 we will break a student, we will separate 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:49.100
 the whites of the yolk that is that in that part 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.750
 that we 're going to use only gem in that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.550
 here are people who use that 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.590
 egg separator is given with it can 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.910
 be used also can not be used 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.190
 the residue of the yolk together with the 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.030
 there is no time to hit it will not give a 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.190
 point of snow equal to one choir 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.200
 here the six eggs there when the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.049
 People put light milk reserved a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.049
 glass of milk to beat together with the 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:24.670
 eggs now then a glass of milk and the 6 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.670
 spoons of corn starch 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.880
 now let's knock the indicator to stay 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 homogeneous 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.270
 only that even after the party goes 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.270
 add a cup of sugar 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.550
 we will hit again to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.550
 melt the sugar 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.590
 We'll put it in with milk later. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 hot will slowly mix that if you 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.360
 putting it all at once will fail the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.670
 egg then you have to be very slow and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.610
 stirring whenever we put 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.500
 beds try if you want too 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.190
 start it cold can also be too 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.100
 No problem here, how are you going? 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.720
 will harden the milk 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.140
 so we have to keep stirring until 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.260
 he turns a cream even has to stay 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.420
 threatened and will begin to harden will 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.590
 staying pilota will not get a cream well 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.660
 homogeneous 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.140
 so here then ten minutes is already 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 ready 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.720
 so here more or less after 10 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.590
 minutes you are with a cream 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.670
 homogeneous stirring constantly not to 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.040
 to embark 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.810
 and then we will turn it on the platter 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.420
 already caramelized 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.350
 this point is very current from the south so 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.370
 He used to be one of 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.410
 It's more of a home-made dessert, and if you 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.230
 can see that condensed milk will not 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.420
 so the dessert that comes out quite 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.760
 because we'll leave him in the way 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.250
 now we're going to sigh that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.260
 goes on to describe what about here 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.350
 such six blocks that we separated 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.750
 before 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.020
 Let's put the mixer on the speed 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.610
 high until it becomes snowy 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:26.270
 question if they do not put it up now 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:28.280
 then it will beat up to her that while 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.410
 It's beating the snow in the snow. 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.930
 will add the sugar gradually 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.380
 because otherwise it will not give the point 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.420
 When is it already in the snow point? 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.790
 even we added is the juice 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.050
 half lemon to give a better taste in the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.810
 clear in snow 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.800
 so this here is the point of the clear she 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.170
 it's very homogeneous well beaten 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.500
 we will pour over the cream 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.500
 account 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.750
 so here we are going to take him to 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.750
 Oven now to love the sigh. 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.950
 so after about 15 minutes 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.080
 in the oven, we already removed it 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.660
 put in the refrigerator around two 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.340
 hours now we will serve the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.820
 dessert then for him to be well 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.840
 I sigh it with a 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:30.110
 People are going to serve it. The cream looks good. 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.410
 consistent with the tail we made 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.710
 she is caught with the lady cream that 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.290
 kitchen then it gets a cream well it is 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.210
 consistent with the sigh in heat 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.970
 so this is our dish today that the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.960
 announced until next week to 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.960
 our next to recipe 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.750

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.610
 is already available on our site life
