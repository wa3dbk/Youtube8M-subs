long explanation to keep the video short
and<00:00:23.150> links<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.660> where<00:00:24.810> i<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> info<00:00:25.500> will

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and links to where i got the info will

and links to where i got the info will
be<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> description<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:27.000> case<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.510> want

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
be in the description in case you want

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
be in the description in case you want
to<00:00:27.840> look<00:00:28.019> around<00:00:28.609> basically<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.640> found<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> more

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to look around basically i found a more

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.319 
to look around basically i found a more
reliable<00:00:30.539> set<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.230> data<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.759> use<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.059> time

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
reliable set of data on to use this time

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.319 
reliable set of data on to use this time
around<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> taken<00:00:35.010> straight<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
around this is taken straight from the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
around this is taken straight from the
game<00:00:36.540> code<00:00:36.809> itself<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.500> basically<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
game code itself but basically the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.240 
game code itself but basically the
concept<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> same<00:00:39.239> we'll<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.719> looking<00:00:39.840> at

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
concept is the same we'll be looking at

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.540 
concept is the same we'll be looking at
minimum<00:00:41.250> time<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.210> takes<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.600> kill<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.290> enemy

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
minimum time it takes to kill an enemy

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.900 
minimum time it takes to kill an enemy
which<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:44.940> into<00:00:45.239> account<00:00:45.510> fire<00:00:46.440> rate

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
which will take into account fire rate

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
which will take into account fire rate
number<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.030> bullets<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> takes<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.899> kill<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
number of bullets it takes to kill and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
number of bullets it takes to kill and
also<00:00:50.219> bullet<00:00:50.730> travel<00:00:51.210> speed<00:00:51.600> which<00:00:52.050> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
also bullet travel speed which is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
also bullet travel speed which is
something<00:00:52.469> i<00:00:52.770> recently<00:00:53.219> learned<00:00:53.520> about

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
something i recently learned about

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.779 
something i recently learned about
basically<00:00:54.559> bullets<00:00:55.559> depending<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.489> gun

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
basically bullets depending on which gun

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
basically bullets depending on which gun
you're<00:00:57.000> firing<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.870> won't<00:00:58.109> travel<00:00:58.440> at

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you're firing it from won't travel at

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
you're firing it from won't travel at
different<00:00:58.829> speeds<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:01.170> only<00:01:01.320> things<00:01:01.500> we

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
different speeds the only things we

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.020 
different speeds the only things we
can't<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.309> into<00:01:02.489> account<00:01:02.789> are

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
can't really take into account are

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
can't really take into account are
recoil<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.780> accuracy<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.549> depends

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
recoil and accuracy because that depends

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
recoil and accuracy because that depends
on<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.570> play<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.439> how<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
on how you play and how you know you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
on how you play and how you know you
managed<00:01:09.360> recoil<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.200> how<00:01:10.470> accurate<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.189> are

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
managed recoil and how accurate you are

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.020 
managed recoil and how accurate you are
with<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.610> shots<00:01:12.560> alright<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.549> gameplay

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
with your shots alright so the gameplay

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
with your shots alright so the gameplay
is<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> first<00:01:16.710> full<00:01:16.950> game<00:01:17.159> i

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
is a you know the first full game i

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
is a you know the first full game i
played<00:01:17.640> after<00:01:17.939> taking<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.540> break<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> play<00:01:19.229> mw3

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
played after taking a break to play mw3

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
played after taking a break to play mw3
it's<00:01:20.759> nothing<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.210> exciting<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's nothing too exciting but it's the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
it's nothing too exciting but it's the
only<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.799> i<00:01:22.920> had<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> post<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
only thing i had and it is post the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.270 
only thing i had and it is post the
december<00:01:25.619> patch

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.820 

and<00:01:28.400> you'll<00:01:29.060> see<00:01:29.330> even<00:01:30.140> though<00:01:30.260> I'm<00:01:30.470> running

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
and you'll see even though I'm running

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.070 
and you'll see even though I'm running
around<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.310> an<00:01:31.430> lmg<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:31.909> do<00:01:32.150> get<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.570> couple<00:01:32.990> of

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
around with an lmg I do get a couple of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.020 
around with an lmg I do get a couple of
long<00:01:33.320> shots<00:01:33.760> so<00:01:34.760> now<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.750> shows

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
long shots so now that just shows

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.480 
long shots so now that just shows
managing<00:01:38.030> recoil<00:01:38.710> accuracy<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:40.250> really

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
managing recoil accuracy it really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.990 
managing recoil accuracy it really
really<00:01:40.640> depends<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:42.020> your<00:01:42.759> comfortable<00:01:43.759> in

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
really depends on on your comfortable in

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.830 
really depends on on your comfortable in
T<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.960> how<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.979> know<00:01:46.420> how<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.479> feel<00:01:47.810> about

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
T and how you know how you feel about

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.340 
T and how you know how you feel about
different<00:01:48.500> gun<00:01:48.800> classes<00:01:49.369> alright<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.990> here

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
different gun classes alright so here

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.910 
different gun classes alright so here
are<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.470> new<00:01:52.210> stats<00:01:53.210> time<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.110> kill<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.799> is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
are the new stats time to kill this is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.999 
are the new stats time to kill this is
time<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.250> come<00:01:55.430> in<00:01:55.460> seconds<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.830> original

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
time to come in seconds and the original

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.560 
time to come in seconds and the original
numbers<00:01:58.520> weren't<00:01:58.700> milliseconds<00:01:59.360> but<00:01:59.509> I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
numbers weren't milliseconds but I

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.150 
numbers weren't milliseconds but I
converted<00:01:59.960> them<00:02:00.170> into<00:02:00.259> seconds<00:02:00.860> because<00:02:00.979> I

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
converted them into seconds because I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.950 
converted them into seconds because I
felt<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.880> was<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.090> lot<00:02:02.240> easier<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.630> read

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
felt that it was a lot easier to read

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.219 
felt that it was a lot easier to read
and<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.320> also<00:02:03.530> added<00:02:03.920> an<00:02:04.220> average<00:02:04.759> column<00:02:05.270> and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
and I also added an average column and

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.620 
and I also added an average column and
amenities<00:02:06.950> by<00:02:07.159> averaging<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:07.970> basically<00:02:08.479> what

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
amenities by averaging so basically what

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.150 
amenities by averaging so basically what
you'll<00:02:08.780> see<00:02:09.019> is<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.259> some<00:02:09.560> guns<00:02:09.769> will<00:02:10.070> be

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
you'll see is that some guns will be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.340 
you'll see is that some guns will be
better<00:02:10.369> at<00:02:10.580> short<00:02:11.450> range<00:02:11.630> but<00:02:11.959> not<00:02:12.110> as<00:02:12.260> good

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
better at short range but not as good

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.340 
better at short range but not as good
when<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.010> comes<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.459> long<00:02:13.670> range<00:02:14.350> but

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
when it comes to long range but

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.290 
when it comes to long range but
obviously<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:15.980> think<00:02:16.010> average<00:02:16.550> makes<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.120> most

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
obviously I think average makes the most

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.259 
obviously I think average makes the most
sense<00:02:17.600> when<00:02:18.290> trying<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.709> rank<00:02:19.010> them<00:02:19.250> right<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
sense when trying to rank them right so

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.759 
sense when trying to rank them right so
first<00:02:20.510> let's<00:02:20.810> take<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.019> look<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.380> assault

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
first let's take a look at assault

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.880 
first let's take a look at assault
rifles<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.400> sm<00:02:22.700> geez<00:02:23.260> I'm<00:02:24.260> only<00:02:24.440> going<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
rifles and sm geez I'm only going to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.330 
rifles and sm geez I'm only going to
include<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.459> first<00:02:25.930> 30<00:02:26.930> or<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:28.160> because

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
include the first 30 or so just because

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
include the first 30 or so just because
I<00:02:28.519> didn't<00:02:28.819> feel<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:28.940> doing<00:02:29.239> all<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.630> them<00:02:29.959> so

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I didn't feel like doing all of them so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.830 
I didn't feel like doing all of them so
feel<00:02:30.800> free<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.250> pause<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.030> read<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.420> charts

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
feel free to pause and read the charts

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.660 
feel free to pause and read the charts
because<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.290> won't<00:02:33.590> have<00:02:33.920> them<00:02:34.160> running<00:02:34.370> for

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
because I won't have them running for

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.080 
because I won't have them running for
that<00:02:34.820> long<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.540> save<00:02:35.810> some<00:02:36.110> time<00:02:37.090> ok

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that long just to save some time ok

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.819 
that long just to save some time ok
hopefully<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.870> had<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.049> chance<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.530> look<00:02:39.650> at

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
hopefully you had a chance to look at

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.710 
hopefully you had a chance to look at
those<00:02:40.070> right<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:40.820> let's<00:02:41.150> take<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:41.630> at

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
those right now let's take a look at

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.380 
those right now let's take a look at
these<00:02:41.959> snipers<00:02:42.579> so<00:02:43.579> note<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.060> difference

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
these snipers so note the difference

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.920 
these snipers so note the difference
between<00:02:44.570> bolt<00:02:45.410> action<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.100> semi<00:02:46.430> autos<00:02:46.930> this

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
between bolt action and semi autos this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.410 
between bolt action and semi autos this
is<00:02:48.110> because<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.519> these<00:02:49.700> numbers<00:02:50.180> are

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
is because you know these numbers are

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.350 
is because you know these numbers are
theoretical<00:02:51.200> maximum<00:02:51.769> which<00:02:52.250> means<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.060> semi

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
theoretical maximum which means the semi

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.199 
theoretical maximum which means the semi
autos<00:02:53.780> were<00:02:54.110> assuming<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:55.010> you'll<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.060> able

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
autos were assuming that you'll be able

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.470 
autos were assuming that you'll be able
to<00:02:56.390> accurately<00:02:56.690> spam<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.680> trigger<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:59.239> get

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
to accurately spam the trigger and get

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.449 
to accurately spam the trigger and get
hits<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.530> won't<00:03:00.769> be<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.010> case<00:03:01.040> when

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
hits so that won't be the case when

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.640 
hits so that won't be the case when
you're<00:03:01.609> far<00:03:01.880> away<00:03:01.910> which<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.480> why<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.260> semi

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
you're far away which is why the semi

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
you're far away which is why the semi
autos<00:03:03.950> look<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.400> lot<00:03:04.730> better<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:05.750> why

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
autos look a lot better so that's why

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.710 
autos look a lot better so that's why
I'm<00:03:05.989> saying<00:03:06.290> only<00:03:06.590> compare<00:03:07.480> semi-autos<00:03:08.480> with

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
I'm saying only compare semi-autos with

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.750 
I'm saying only compare semi-autos with
other<00:03:08.870> semi<00:03:09.200> autos<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.859> bolt<00:03:10.100> actions<00:03:10.549> with

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
other semi autos and bolt actions with

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.380 
other semi autos and bolt actions with
other<00:03:10.970> protections<00:03:11.739> all<00:03:12.739> right<00:03:13.209> I'm<00:03:14.209> not

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
other protections all right I'm not

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.090 
other protections all right I'm not
going<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.600> include<00:03:14.690> shotgun<00:03:15.470> stats<00:03:15.769> because

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
going to include shotgun stats because

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.580 
going to include shotgun stats because
they<00:03:16.790> vary<00:03:17.120> greatly<00:03:17.359> depending<00:03:17.720> on<00:03:18.200> what<00:03:18.410> type

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
they vary greatly depending on what type

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.750 
they vary greatly depending on what type
of<00:03:18.620> shells

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
of shells

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.420 
of shells
see<00:03:20.000> maybe<00:03:20.989> if<00:03:21.260> there's<00:03:21.530> enough<00:03:21.830> demand<00:03:21.860> I'll

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
see maybe if there's enough demand I'll

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.309 
see maybe if there's enough demand I'll
do<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.700> separate<00:03:23.150> video<00:03:23.299> on<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.689> because<00:03:24.200> it's

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
do a separate video on that because it's

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.490 
do a separate video on that because it's
actually<00:03:24.500> pretty<00:03:24.829> interesting<00:03:25.629> and<00:03:26.629> finally

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
actually pretty interesting and finally

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.149 
actually pretty interesting and finally
here's<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.890> look<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:29.110> pistols<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:30.799> only<00:03:30.950> took

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
here's a look at pistols so I only took

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.789 
here's a look at pistols so I only took
into<00:03:31.430> account<00:03:31.750> 12<00:03:32.750> 30<00:03:33.019> meters<00:03:33.409> with<00:03:33.680> the

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
into account 12 30 meters with the

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.920 
into account 12 30 meters with the
averages<00:03:34.400> because<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.879> figured<00:03:35.329> there's

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
averages because I figured there's

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.509 
averages because I figured there's
really<00:03:36.170> not<00:03:36.409> that<00:03:36.470> much<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:37.010> chance<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
really not that much of a chance that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.890 
really not that much of a chance that
you're<00:03:37.640> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.819> get<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.000> kill<00:03:38.329> at<00:03:38.569> long

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
you're going to get a kill at long

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.530 
you're going to get a kill at long
distances<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.890> didn't<00:03:40.099> want<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.510> skew<00:03:41.510> the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
distances so I didn't want to skew the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.589 
distances so I didn't want to skew the
data<00:03:41.720> basically<00:03:43.150> all<00:03:44.150> right<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.360> that's

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
data basically all right so that's

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.750 
data basically all right so that's
that's<00:03:44.900> basically<00:03:45.409> it<00:03:45.530> for<00:03:45.890> these<00:03:46.310> charts

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
that's basically it for these charts

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.420 
that's basically it for these charts
again<00:03:47.030> if<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.810> didn't<00:03:48.500> have<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.159> read

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
again if you didn't have time to read

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.160 
again if you didn't have time to read
through<00:03:49.459> all<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.790> them<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.060> go<00:03:50.450> back<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:50.870> hit

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
through all of them just go back and hit

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.550 
through all of them just go back and hit
the<00:03:51.290> pause<00:03:51.470> button<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.720> other<00:03:54.019> thing<00:03:54.140> to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the pause button and the other thing to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.589 
the pause button and the other thing to
note<00:03:54.769> is<00:03:54.799> really<00:03:55.459> i<00:03:55.640> mean<00:03:55.849> if<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.150> take<00:03:56.329> a<00:03:56.359> look

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
note is really i mean if you take a look

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.099 
note is really i mean if you take a look
