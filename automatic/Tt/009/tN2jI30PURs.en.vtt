there's<00:00:17.810> a<00:00:17.930> lot<00:00:18.140> of<00:00:18.170> cut<00:00:18.500> out<00:00:18.619> parts<00:00:18.980> on<00:00:19.130> their

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
there's a lot of cut out parts on their

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.220 
there's a lot of cut out parts on their
reason<00:00:20.120> why<00:00:20.240> is<00:00:20.300> because<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:20.840> use<00:00:20.960> body

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
reason why is because we use body

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.170 
reason why is because we use body
mapping<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:22.130> minimize<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.790> weight<00:00:23.000> and

mapping to minimize the weight and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.660 
mapping to minimize the weight and
optimize<00:00:23.600> comfort<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.320> support<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:25.280> warmth
