00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.600
 Ten years have passed since round the world without scales encompassed by Bertrand 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.869
 piccard imbroda and width 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.920
 something of itching is ready to give another return to the earth this time on board 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.609
 a plane ap proportion solar 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.300
 pica and his co-pilot Andre Borschberg have worked on the solar project 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.079
 time they look for six years 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.170
 in June 2009 they presented their mother's prototype in zÃ¼rich 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.620
 and there is that 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.460
 Yesterday 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.930
 it was a dream 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.590
 poe is an aircraft 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.390
 tomorrow he will be an ambassador of renewable energy and savings 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.870
 energetic 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870
 solari payments people 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.100
 the gleaming one would only impose a huge dimension 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.330
 equal to that of a chumbo yet but weighs less than a mid-sized car 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.890
 over its wings are arranged more than 12 thousand solar cells that provide 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.520
 power to four electric motors 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.550
 during the day the cells also recharge the batteries that allow the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.650
 flight during the night when the ship flies low altitudes 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.190
 and next to him if we manage to fly around the world without fuel 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.320
 no one can claim the car that it is impossible to use renewable energy 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 for night heating or other appliance 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.740
 NASA has worked for decades in the development of solar energy that is 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.420
 able to keep a ship for several weeks in the air for missions 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.630
 scientific 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.490
 the helios has been the fourth generation of gliders and crew 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 but in 2003 it rushed into the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.439
 the material used for the rooms did not withstand the strong turbulence 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 one of the challenges of the 70 engineers and technicians who collaborate in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.969
 the chopping project 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.269
 has been building a ship and light but very stable 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.280
 the former Swiss astronaut clot nicolle responsible for the experimental flights 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 of the ship 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.700
 has contributed to design a control board that avoids inclinations exes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.849
 children of homes consults 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.220
 consecrate times are limited to a turning angle of 15 to 20 degrees 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 the plane can not control a higher inflation 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.459
 if there is an inflation of 5 degrees this light starts apart claw what 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.040
 means that the pilot must be cautious approaching a situation that 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.040
 it can become critical 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.820
 the engines have been designed to work in extreme conditions 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.120
 can operate at temperatures ranging from 80 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.939
 Under zero grades 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.699
 the developed power is still limited 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.840
 the average speed will be about 70 kilometers per hour 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:05.269
 chop has practiced for days in an aerial simulator 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.730
 the special suit designed for pilots controls their biometric data 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.730
 and send the information to the on-board computer 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.680
 the suit has alarm sensors that warn the pilot in case of theft odeh 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 an incorrect flight position 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.230
 Instead of sleeping, you will see that they will resort to hypnosis and 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.609
 medication to relax vos berk has started with his yoga sessions 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:32.889
 daily 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.219
 the total budget of the project is 107 million Swiss francs 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:42.879
 the general public can contribute to the units concept 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.760
 Bezabeh country there are many people who ask us how to support the project 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.180
 without being a great sponsor 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.060
 that's why we launched a backup program to our solar website 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.960
 impulse together with everyone with whom interested parties can adopt a cell 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.300
 solar totalize an exclusive visit the facilities by inscribing his name in 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.300
 the fuselage of the ship the court beach day 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.139
 the first experimental flight will be in autumn 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.809
 the dream of itching to fly without fossil fuel will then be made 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.809
 reality 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
