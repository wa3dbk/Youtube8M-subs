 bull city 3 so the pictures of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.260
 Extensions we have seen now 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.220
 Let's focus on football 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 Let's focus on this derby 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.510
 great choreography of the fans but unfortunately 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 then again fogguns so that too 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.070
 our camera can hardly catch what 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.989
 to offer fans their team 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.700
 let's have a look what the team 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.420
 then in face to face forward in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.920
 white load in red and black and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 forward with the first one actually up 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 but the right side package quickly but 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.250
 you can already see that is good 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.320
 that fitted the first huts exactly 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 and do not want to move forward properly 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 get involved in the game 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.050
 in the beginning of a few minutes 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 although readers read something more 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.559
 have game shares and also a lot 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 try faster in the direction of forex 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.010
 gate to come to the housing of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.560
 Goalkeeper Great easy to endanger the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 here with the first flank than there is no 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.020
 problem for a big opera 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.119
 the man with the number 10 of the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.770
 most dangerous radovan vujanovic canteen 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.270
 too late 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 Again , it is more modern with 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.320
 eight and voyage entire protected as 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.030
 Great was at the place and at the axes 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.549
 again the linzer then goes the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.799
 Ball into the goal dangerous situation 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.750
 here and first test for one 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.479
 big alba in red white housing 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.100
 yes, of course, front last bands permanent 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.579
 Under pressure is then the next 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.840
 possibility again is this royal 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.280
 fire-threatening striker does not mean 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 in vain the reigning scorer 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.689
 in regionalliga and also this year 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.360
 one of the best scorers in the league 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.430
 thrives so rarely life direction 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.950
 half of the game then call over the wings 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.840
 since then the balls come to this edge 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 Of this machida high and far beyond that 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.799
 No danger for the lask again 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.479
 further tee of great alba too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.850
 here it happens that you sit in the banks 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.409
 her the somewhat quiet hackl of feri 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.299
 why the referees are not here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.459
 Do you actually know and that is 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.149
 certainly no advantage to the next 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.700
 possibility 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.140
 you catch or relatives ready and then 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.849
 there's the whistle of the referee 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.830
 after all, no interruptions 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.230
 decide the forward but again 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.090
 an action the appointment is the linzer 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.170
 Schlussmann got me this ball in the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.300
 penalty no problem 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.190
 then the forward cards prove again 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.959
 how stupid they really are 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.760
 shoot like a rocket is playing 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.430
 and your own players have to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.170
 liberate these rides from racing here 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 why you can be so stupid I know 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.459
 it does not then forward again that me 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.590
 now try a little more in the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.300
 final phase of the first half but then 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.050
 again lightning-fast attacks vinzer 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 about fabiano and take over from 27 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.230
 fabio silver still silver fabiano 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 fabian 20 meters and the ax exactly 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.879
 Immediately before the break we are here 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.250
 about repetition are for calls 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.650
 just hit exactly shot from 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.080
 his new sound fabian and practical 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.360
 with the pause whistle the left lead 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.950
 10 maybe something deserves but in 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.959
 this phase of the game just before the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.200
 break it should not have been so 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.209
 half-time 0 1 also the second half 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.440
 started attacking again with a linzer 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.390
 dangerous the ball in the penalty room 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.060
 the forward defense like her 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.250
 somehow always a step too slow 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.409
 head shot here makes the ball easy 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.690
 Good luck forwards after this 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.590
 rod shot of fabian left rod 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.819
 right bar 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.849
 then the ball jumps into the field 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.519
 back from that results fortunately for 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.220
 us only one out throw next 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.920
 possibility again fabiano the b423 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.810
 distributed 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.290
 the next option and again 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.370
 the linzer next you stop this 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.260
 dangerous situation but already 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.780
 whistled by referee 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.160
 decided off but big alpha would be 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.800
 then read that chance 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.870
 So it only prevents time 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400
 then again a corner for the lask 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.060
 were coming up in the strafraum 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.239
 lageder eighth and that's 20 grand 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.519
 voyage that is for the forward that is 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.260
 good luck to see you repeat here 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.360
 big band arrives in the penalty room 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.459
 we are somehow forwarded and 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.989
 because you have to lay hands away with the phone 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.380
 do to risk an eleven meter 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.019
 Our striker beams at exactly when they are 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.180
 have stones and yes do that 2 2 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.710
 of course, now on the internet are whole 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.419
 clearly better team here next 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.800
 but again the whistle of 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.290
 the referee also this hit 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.810
 does not count on offside 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.430
 we absolutely can not dissolve after 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.340
 This decision was taken by the referee trio 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.080
 will probably be right 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.180
 of course now has to call forward 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.130
 do more now and live practically 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.810
 from one account to another 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.660
 linzer especially from diana and fabio 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.520
 Silva are in top form are just the 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.500
 better as well as shamelessly over here again 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.840
 the case of a just over the scoreboard 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.640
 makes one of the few opportunities for 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.380
 forward or ball into the penalty area 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.419
 list comes but you look here 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.760
 a ball from forward with one 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.430
 as fast as lightning, this hits the left 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.810
 page berlin 27 would run if he 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.090
 all of them and against big ball 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.220
 great but then the chance 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.520
 over no again that's him 2 3 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.680
 drive back we are on 75 minutes the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.139
 the decision here is great alba though 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.610
 then 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.229
 we're all alone again then lets 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.210
 everyone comes out 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.439
 forward defense too late you always 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.139
 13 0 and therefore the final 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.270
 decision then maybe something 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.120
 provocative behavior and that already 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.249
 mentioned lower down then then we 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.800
 accordingly continue to the enzer 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:37.129
 why always so bad but that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.360
 somehow tough forwards though now has 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.759
 one or the other possibility 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.529
 because the lask withdraws a bit 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.449
 but really dangerous about chances 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.270
 do not arise those few opportunities 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.610
 Half a header but no danger 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.199
 for goalkeeper ferryman in the 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.539
 final phase then the game actually 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.889
 I want to concentrate both teams 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.460
 play their part in midfield 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.379
 down 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.569
 The linzer a little better and then it works 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.550
 to end forward actually loses 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.550
 very clear that with equal to zero
