00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
that aspect the ISO bag however has

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.149 
that aspect the ISO bag however has
these<00:02:38.250> nettings<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:40.260> front<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:41.099> I

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
these nettings on the front that I

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.520

really<00:02:41.549> honestly<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.269> hate<00:02:42.629> them<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.169> a<00:02:43.349> waste

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
really honestly I hate them it's a waste

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.399 
really honestly I hate them it's a waste
of<00:02:43.769> space<00:02:44.069> if<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:45.000> put<00:02:45.180> anything<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.200> it

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
of space if you put anything in here it

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.089 
of space if you put anything in here it
falls<00:02:46.829> out<00:02:47.389> there<00:02:48.389> are<00:02:48.659> couches<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.859> side

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
falls out there are couches on the side

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.449 
falls out there are couches on the side
and<00:02:51.260> there<00:02:52.260> are<00:02:52.439> compartments<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.250> top

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
and there are compartments at the top

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.229 
and there are compartments at the top
but<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.599> very<00:02:54.689> flimsy<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> really<00:02:56.969> like

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
but it is very flimsy so I really like

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.319 
but it is very flimsy so I really like
that<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.689> six<00:02:57.989> pack<00:02:58.290> holds<00:02:59.069> its<00:02:59.219> shape

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
that the six pack holds its shape

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.720 
that the six pack holds its shape
because<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.629> tower<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.489> ISO<00:03:02.489> bag

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
because of the tower and the ISO bag

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.020 
because of the tower and the ISO bag
unless<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> haven't<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:04.079> filled<00:03:04.469> up<00:03:05.030> with

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
everything it is really kind of flimsy

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.659 
everything it is really kind of flimsy
in<00:03:12.109> terms<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.230> fitting<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.769> amount<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.129> meals
