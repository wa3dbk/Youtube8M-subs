like<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:49.430> then<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.640> decided<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.180> use<00:00:51.390> duct

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
like this then I decided to use duct

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
like this then I decided to use duct
tape<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.110> use<00:00:52.170> fabric<00:00:52.640> whatever<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
tape you can use fabric whatever you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.959 
tape you can use fabric whatever you
want<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:55.079> covered<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.829> DVD<00:00:56.250> case<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
want and I covered the DVD case and it's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
want and I covered the DVD case and it's
really<00:00:57.149> simple<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.109> use<00:00:58.230> any<00:00:58.530> technique

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
really simple you can use any technique

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:34.840 
really simple you can use any technique
you<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.640> cover<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> up

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.770 

then<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.149> done<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:36.539> should<00:01:36.720> look

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
then when you're done it should look

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
then when you're done it should look
something<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.830> think<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.159> really

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
something like this I think it's really

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
have to be really careful with this

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.260 
have to be really careful with this
because<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.460> don't<00:03:19.490> want<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.910> crack<00:03:20.120> your

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
eyeshadow as I said before you don't

necessarily have to use heat to get your
eyeshadows<00:03:42.500> out<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.800> just<00:03:43.010> need<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> knife<00:03:43.400> but

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
eyeshadows out you just need a knife but

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.120 
eyeshadows out you just need a knife but
the<00:03:44.270> heat<00:03:44.540> does<00:03:44.900> help<00:03:45.350> when<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.860> get<00:03:45.980> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
the heat does help when you get the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.770 
the heat does help when you get the
eyeshadows<00:03:46.640> out<00:03:46.850> because<00:03:47.090> they<00:03:47.270> don't<00:03:47.480> crack

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
eyeshadows out because they don't crack

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.260 
eyeshadows out because they don't crack
as<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:48.680> see<00:03:48.890> here<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.520> didn't<00:03:49.970> use<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
as you can see here I didn't use the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.700 
as you can see here I didn't use the
heat<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.900> kind<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.230> cracked<00:03:51.500> my

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
heat and it kind of cracked my

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.100 
heat and it kind of cracked my
eyeshadows<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.420> be<00:03:53.570> really

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
eyeshadows so you have to be really

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.870 
eyeshadows so you have to be really
careful<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.800> deciding<00:03:55.340> whether<00:03:55.460> you<00:03:55.640> want<00:03:55.820> to

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
careful in deciding whether you want to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.650 
careful in deciding whether you want to
use<00:03:55.910> heat<00:03:56.330> or<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.600> regular<00:03:57.080> knife<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:58.450> lot<00:03:59.450> of

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
use heat or a regular knife a lot of

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.290 
use heat or a regular knife a lot of
little<00:04:00.020> single<00:04:00.470> eyeshadows<00:04:01.130> have<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.700> lot<00:04:02.060> of

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
little single eyeshadows have a lot of

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.750 
little single eyeshadows have a lot of
packaging<00:04:02.990> so<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.740> want<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.130> take<00:04:04.340> as<00:04:04.550> much

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
packaging so you want to take as much

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.390 
packaging so you want to take as much
packaging<00:04:05.360> off<00:04:05.600> as<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.990> can<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.710> you're<00:04:07.190> left

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
packaging off as you can so you're left

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.490 
packaging off as you can so you're left
with<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.970> pan<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.660> eyeshadow<00:04:09.170> and

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
with just the pan of the eyeshadow and

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.560 
with just the pan of the eyeshadow and
then<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:10.070> can<00:04:10.280> heat<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.580> like<00:04:10.850> normal<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
then you can heat it like normal and

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.979 
then you can heat it like normal and
take<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.290> eyeshadow<00:04:12.770> out<00:04:13.040> with<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.250> knife<00:04:13.989> like

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
take the eyeshadow out with a knife like

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.930 
take the eyeshadow out with a knife like
I<00:04:15.110> said<00:04:15.290> before<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:15.860> can<00:04:16.010> use<00:04:16.190> heat<00:04:16.520> or<00:04:16.790> you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
I said before you can use heat or you

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.490 
I said before you can use heat or you
don't<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.270> to<00:04:17.570> depending<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.169> how<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
don't have to depending on how the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.680 
don't have to depending on how the
eyeshadows<00:04:19.190> package<00:04:19.640> but<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.910> suggest<00:04:20.270> using

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
eyeshadows package but I suggest using

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.450 
eyeshadows package but I suggest using
heat<00:04:21.020> anyway<00:04:21.470> because<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.890> won't<00:04:22.070> crack<00:04:22.280> your

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
heat anyway because it won't crack your

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.330 
heat anyway because it won't crack your

potting<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.810> instead<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.200> magnets<00:04:57.890> I<00:04:58.250> decided

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
potting so instead of magnets I decided

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.450 
potting so instead of magnets I decided
to<00:04:59.270> hot<00:04:59.450> glue<00:04:59.600> my<00:04:59.840> eyeshadows<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.980> palette
