 this could turn off slider 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.430
 cortina is activated can she

 features in different settings 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 let it deactivate so there is 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.230
 some services as they only extremely 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.850
 can severely disable so can

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.040
 easily disable 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.049
 In addition, Windows 10 reserves 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.310
 the right thing to do without diagnosis and 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.510
 to send usage data to microsoft 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.400
 to shut down these services 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.410
 complicated and not easy about 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.000
 built-in switch feasible one 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.220
 deactivation can be on different 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.290
 such as by 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.979
 the manual input of complex commands 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.750
 or by tools like you because there 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.400
 methods, however, intervened more deeply in the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.990
 require operating system and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.250
 Side effects can have on the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.650
 first look are not apparent 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.390
 These measures should only be really effective 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.760
 experienced users are taken and 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.440
 be performed 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.250
 microsoft collects many with windows 10 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.020
 data about you 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.150
 although that was already in earlier ones 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.039
 windows versions of the case under the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.750
 Cover of new features falls 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.039
 the data collection, however, considerably 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.080
 easier than before 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.789
 if your privacy is important to you 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.070
 and me the additional features of 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.720
 not convince windows 10 you should 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.160
 think twice if you think so 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.160
 operating system installed
