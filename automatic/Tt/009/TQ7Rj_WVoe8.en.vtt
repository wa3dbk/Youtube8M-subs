00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
whipped cream floating things I don't

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.690 
whipped cream floating things I don't
know<00:02:24.860> why<00:02:24.980> they<00:02:25.069> call<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.370> root<00:02:25.519> beer<00:02:25.640> float

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
know why they call it a root beer float

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.640 
know why they call it a root beer float
cuz<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.239> root<00:02:26.390> beer<00:02:26.569> doesn't<00:02:26.720> float<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.140> sinks

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
cuz the root beer doesn't float it sinks

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.580 
cuz the root beer doesn't float it sinks
that<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.160> white<00:02:28.310> stuff<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.849> top<00:02:29.120> floats<00:02:29.629> they

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that the white stuff on top floats they

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.080 
that the white stuff on top floats they
should<00:02:30.800> call<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.160> whipped<00:02:31.340> cream<00:02:31.430> float<00:02:31.910> so

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
should call it a whipped cream float so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.520 
should call it a whipped cream float so
we're<00:02:32.300> going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.480> use<00:02:32.569> some<00:02:32.599> white<00:02:32.900> stuff<00:02:33.050> so
