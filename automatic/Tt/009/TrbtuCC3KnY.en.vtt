00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
learned about with their race car the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.219 
learned about with their race car the
standard<00:01:04.519> 3-series<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.239> already<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.990> best

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229

so<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.210> SRH<00:01:08.810> should<00:01:09.079> be<00:01:09.259> even<00:01:09.619> better

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
so the SRH should be even better

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.290 
so the SRH should be even better
