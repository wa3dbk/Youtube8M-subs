00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.620
 very good kids how are you and 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.389
 I hope that this great perfectly 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.400
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:24.100
 video 601 to all this the video 600 went up 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.200
 before or yesterday I do not know when I get up done 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.330
 and we have only one bloodthirsty one 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.790
 run of five to get the gold from us 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:37.590
 ballista poked out the head 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.590
 little head 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.110
 it's weird that nobody came out 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.930
 through 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.070
 as I say you want us only one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.960
 streak of 5 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.050
 it's the mister seen we're going to go by 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.050
 here 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.629
 lightning a streak of 5 a bloodthirsty and 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.629
 we will have the gold of the dawn ready 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.049
 wait 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.360
 and marquez in the head and in the head and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.590
 I 've made a hit mark him then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.689
 people say snipers 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.760
 they are sitting because I do not know what 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.760
 it's costing more 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.580
 or the fact he 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.220
 lsv the ballista because I think that I 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.370
 it's costing the ballista more to take it out 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.230
 because the bloodthirsty with the sv ume 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.450
 almost almost without wanting and with the 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.360
 ballista because it's costing me 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.580
 costing to get me out pretty enough 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.920
 pretty pretty 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.920
 and in fact a local the good thing about 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.759
 little train 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.759
 this over here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980
 do not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.689
 in fact 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.049
 Beijing marker 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 - here the bloodthirsty almost almost 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.550
 want as I say and with the ballista 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.720
 it's costing me a lot more 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 much much more we lose faith 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.400
 in cane and in front of nobody 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.270
 the one of that ere has abnormal that ere 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.150
 the team in 50 here cr 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.930
 I was wearing that is the hole in the diamond 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.930
 I love 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.510
 tell me I'm not giving it to come 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.349
 but please how can I do so much in 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.349
 marker with this sniper junk 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.050
 and without marquez he has done 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.560
 and between that and that you stay on 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.980
 the corner punto campero look at the pig 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.980
 more pork 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.950

 I will not let me out a bloodthirsty is 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.800
 a streak of 5 simply from what it is 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.610
 what I need and just the same 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.920
 in outside 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.910
 the chest up if this has given me 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.780
 one shot but 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.780
 work 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.450

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.630

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.770
 besides that until then 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.490
 outside 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.360

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.370
 pain gold gold hard the program of 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.990
 difference cooperation 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.990
 for gold gold 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.070
 a boy I think I'm going to cut here the 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.260
 departure when it's over 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.740
 the round that's going to eat out there 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.300
 I'm going to cut here the game to 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.100
 that you see the golden camouflage of the ballista 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 when the game is over and you leave 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.720
 main menu is worth so for 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.060
 we follow the strip wait video 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.540
 and throws shot 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.900
 and wait for him to leave the game the 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.169
 heading then the round 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.060
 for not cutting half and back I'm going to the 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.220
 second Roman to play alone without recording 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.789
 so that when the camouflage ends there 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:32.449
 of the beacon good guys we already have the 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.039
 gold of the paddler ten medals of 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.300
 bloodthirsty something that we were missing already 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:42.620
 We have the diamond camouflage will 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.990
 put the golden camouflage on it, not the diamond 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.190
 let's put the diamond to all 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:52.220
 I already have snipers 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.560
 unlocked the diamond so no 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.870
 you think I forgot the 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.420
 sniper I walk with the four guys was 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.100
 waiting to do the challenges with him 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.639
 with the sniper to make them 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.099
 planes with the four with him 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.659
 with the diamond camouflage it's worth it 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.550
 that I already have the camouflage diamonds and 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.310
