nothing to say to the media loud last
week<00:00:49.680> after<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.370> believe<00:00:50.579> he<00:00:50.670> only<00:00:50.700> had<00:00:50.940> six

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
week after I believe he only had six

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.170 
week after I believe he only had six
carries<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.440> last<00:00:52.739> week's<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.699> look

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
carries on in last week's game so look

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
carries on in last week's game so look
for<00:00:54.329> them<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.660> him<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.140> involved<00:00:55.710> all

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
for them to get him more involved all

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
for them to get him more involved all
right<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.239> in

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
right and I think at this point in

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.819 
right and I think at this point in
Kaepernick's<00:00:57.989> career<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
Kaepernick's career they need to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
Kaepernick's career they need to
establish<00:00:58.980> still<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> establish<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
establish still need to establish the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
establish still need to establish the
run<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:01.109> him<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.440> efficient<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> don't<00:01:02.190> ease

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
run for him to be efficient I don't ease

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
run for him to be efficient I don't ease
the<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> guy<00:01:02.940> yet<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.870> drop<00:01:04.080> back

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the kind of guy yet that can drop back

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
the kind of guy yet that can drop back
and<00:01:04.470> throw<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> ball<00:01:04.920> 40<00:01:05.430> 45<00:01:05.880> times<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> game

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
and throw the ball 40 45 times in a game

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
and throw the ball 40 45 times in a game
and<00:01:06.930> him<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.650> him<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> reason<00:01:08.820> why<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and him have him be the reason why you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
and him have him be the reason why you
win<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.810> his<00:01:09.990> arm<00:01:10.200> obviously<00:01:10.979> we've<00:01:11.100> seen

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
win with his arm obviously we've seen

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620 
win with his arm obviously we've seen
what<00:01:11.460> he<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.850> his<00:01:11.909> legs<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
what he can do with his legs over the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
what he can do with his legs over the
years<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.070> games<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
years and really take over games but I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
years and really take over games but I
think<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.479> starts<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.040> running

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
think that all starts with that running

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
think that all starts with that running
game<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.090> case<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.570> Francoeur<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
game and in this case with Francoeur and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
game and in this case with Francoeur and
Carlos<00:01:19.530> Hyde<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> particular<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> defense<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
Carlos Hyde in particular the defense of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
Carlos Hyde in particular the defense of
San<00:01:22.049> Francisco<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.369> where<00:01:24.119> they're

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
San Francisco look I think where they're

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
San Francisco look I think where they're
vulnerable<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.990> times<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> secondary

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
vulnerable at times is in the secondary

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
vulnerable at times is in the secondary
I<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.939> think<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.299> good<00:01:27.330> thing<00:01:27.659> now

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I don't think that's a good thing now

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
I don't think that's a good thing now
when<00:01:28.409> you're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.860> against<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
when you're going up against the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
when you're going up against the
Philadelphia<00:01:30.659> Eagles<00:01:30.689> certainly<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.040> where

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
Philadelphia Eagles certainly but where

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.469 
Philadelphia Eagles certainly but where
I<00:01:32.220> expect<00:01:32.700> them<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> able<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:33.299> even

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I expect them to be able to take even

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.899 
I expect them to be able to take even
more<00:01:33.630> advantaged<00:01:34.290> than<00:01:34.530> other<00:01:34.890> teams<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
more advantaged than other teams is the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
more advantaged than other teams is the
fact<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> Eagles<00:01:36.689> offensive<00:01:37.170> line<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
fact that the Eagles offensive line is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
fact that the Eagles offensive line is
banged<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.520> Lane<00:01:39.180> Johnson

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
banged up as we know Lane Johnson

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
banged up as we know Lane Johnson
serving<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> last<00:01:40.770> game<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.189> his<00:01:41.369> four-game

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
serving the last game of his four-game

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.899 
serving the last game of his four-game
suspension<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:44.189> from<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
suspension as we know so can from a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
suspension as we know so can from a
running<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.390> standpoint<00:01:45.990> LeSean<00:01:46.380> McCoy

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
running game standpoint LeSean McCoy

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
running game standpoint LeSean McCoy
hasn't<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.430> able<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hasn't really been able to get going I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
hasn't really been able to get going I
don't<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.079> he<00:01:49.229> starts<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
don't think he starts to get going this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
don't think he starts to get going this
week<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> particular<00:01:51.180> matchup<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
week with this particular matchup I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
week with this particular matchup I
think<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:52.799> any<00:01:53.009> advantage<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
think if there's any advantage that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
think if there's any advantage that
Philadelphia<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.340> pretty

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Philadelphia has as they have pretty

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.090 
Philadelphia has as they have pretty
much<00:01:56.670> every<00:01:57.060> week<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.420> scrolls<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.560> McCoy

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
much every week is scrolls and McCoy

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
much every week is scrolls and McCoy
coming<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> backfield<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.360> receivers

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
coming out in the backfield as receivers

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.190 
coming out in the backfield as receivers
on<00:02:01.229> some<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> these<00:02:02.090> 49ers<00:02:03.090> linebackers<00:02:03.780> well

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
on some of these 49ers linebackers well

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
on some of these 49ers linebackers well

see if Nick Foles can expose those

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
see if Nick Foles can expose those

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
always look really good I thought last

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400 
always look really good I thought last
week<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.879> his<00:02:12.209> best<00:02:12.390> game

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

some<00:02:13.860> some<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> first<00:02:14.820> two<00:02:15.030> games<00:02:15.060> he

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
some some of the first two games he

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.060 
some some of the first two games he
didn't<00:02:15.660> look<00:02:15.780> great<00:02:16.080> but<00:02:16.590> definitely<00:02:16.800> an

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
didn't look great but definitely an

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.650 
didn't look great but definitely an
encouraging<00:02:17.220> sign<00:02:17.760> against<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> Redskins

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
encouraging sign against the Redskins

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
encouraging sign against the Redskins
defense<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.560> great<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
defense that's not that great but you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.610 
defense that's not that great but you
know<00:02:20.640> nonetheless<00:02:21.060> he<00:02:21.870> did<00:02:22.050> show<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.410> pretty

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
know nonetheless he did show out pretty

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.520 
know nonetheless he did show out pretty
well<00:02:22.940> look<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.210> San<00:02:24.600> Francisco<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:25.140> try<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.350> be

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
well look for San Francisco to try to be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.410 
well look for San Francisco to try to be
physical<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:26.280> these<00:02:26.790> Philadelphia

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
physical with these Philadelphia

Maclin and Jordan Matthews and company

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.490 
Maclin and Jordan Matthews and company
how<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.040> they<00:02:32.160> respond<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.380> me

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
how do they respond to that and for me

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160 
how do they respond to that and for me
for<00:02:34.800> both<00:02:35.010> defenses<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:36.750> guard<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
for both defenses how do they guard the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
for both defenses how do they guard the
tight<00:02:37.380> end<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.800> think<00:02:38.310> that's<00:02:38.430> going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
tight end I think that's going to be a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.660 
tight end I think that's going to be a
huge<00:02:38.970> factor<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:40.100> san<00:02:41.100> francisco<00:02:41.490> in

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
huge factor in this one san francisco in

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.340 
huge factor in this one san francisco in
particular<00:02:41.940> we<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.960> you'd<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.140> to

particular we know that you'd like to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.070 
particular we know that you'd like to
use<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.830> tight<00:02:44.010> end<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.430> their<00:02:44.940> offense<00:02:45.450> are

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
use the tight end in their offense are

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.890 
use the tight end in their offense are
they<00:02:46.260> able<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:46.980> effectively<00:02:47.130> is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
they able to do so effectively is

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.970 
they able to do so effectively is
Philadelphia<00:02:48.900> able<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> get<00:02:49.470> any<00:02:49.620> pressure<00:02:49.860> on

Philadelphia able to get any pressure on

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
Philip to Washington last week when Kirk

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.830 
Philip to Washington last week when Kirk
Cousins<00:03:01.290> who<00:03:01.800> look<00:03:02.010> very<00:03:02.280> bad<00:03:02.550> on<00:03:03.360> Thursday

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
Cousins who look very bad on Thursday

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.940 
Cousins who look very bad on Thursday
night<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.350> something<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> keep<00:03:04.830> in

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
night so that's something to keep in

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.250 
night so that's something to keep in
mind<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.660> Philadelphia

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
mind here about that Philadelphia

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.410 
mind here about that Philadelphia
defense<00:03:07.710> I<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.190> they're<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.460> weak<00:03:08.820> link<00:03:09.180> in

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
defense I think they're the weak link in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.350 
defense I think they're the weak link in
this<00:03:10.380> game<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:10.860> far<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.220> units<00:03:11.610> go<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.000> don't

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
this game as far as units go I don't

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.760 
this game as far as units go I don't
think<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.630> San<00:03:12.840> Francisco<00:03:13.260> defense<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
think that San Francisco defense is

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.770 
think that San Francisco defense is
great<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.580> think<00:03:14.850> their<00:03:15.000> run<00:03:15.240> defense<00:03:15.420> is

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
great but I think their run defense is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.440 
great but I think their run defense is
very<00:03:15.960> good<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.520> think<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.209> will<00:03:18.420> be

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
very good and I think that will be

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.330 
very good and I think that will be
enough<00:03:18.570> sort<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.650> curtail<00:03:20.040> where

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
enough sort of curtail where

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340 
enough sort of curtail where
Philadelphia<00:03:20.820> doesn't<00:03:21.060> score<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.810> 34

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
Philadelphia doesn't score you know 34

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.740 
Philadelphia doesn't score you know 34
37<00:03:22.800> points<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.060> Philly<00:03:24.300> defense

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
37 points on them so the Philly defense

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.110 
37 points on them so the Philly defense
is<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.990> unit<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.350> worry<00:03:25.650> about<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.160> also<00:03:26.459> you

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
is the unit I worry about and also you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.880 
is the unit I worry about and also you
have<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.360> factor<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:27.930> motivation<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
have to factor in motivation and the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.620

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
team that needs to gain the most and the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.300 
team that needs to gain the most and the
team<00:03:30.810> that's<00:03:30.959> desperate<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.620> by<00:03:31.860> far<00:03:32.100> and
