00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
so I droid denying the gas of tarsan so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.940

tarsan will be forced to try to do more

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.120 
tarsan will be forced to try to do more

most likely will throw another refinery
down<00:03:05.910> here<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.450> try<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.080> more<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.500> more

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
down here and try to get more and more

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
and now a supply depot over here so it's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.850 
and now a supply depot over here so it's
going<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.780> fairly<00:03:13.110> difficult<00:03:13.350> for

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
going to be fairly difficult for

full exposure than those bit then those

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.479 
full exposure than those bit then those
paintings<00:03:24.989> are<00:03:25.140> much<00:03:25.290> easier<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.830> get<00:03:26.160> any<00:03:26.340> set

type<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.760> destruction<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.330> finally<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.080> see

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
type of destruction and finally we see

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.810 
type of destruction and finally we see
that<00:03:28.380> metabolic<00:03:28.650> boost<00:03:28.980> now<00:03:29.190> being<00:03:29.459> trained

that metabolic boost now being trained
sunny<00:03:30.120> now<00:03:30.330> getting<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.690> second<00:03:31.110> Queen<00:03:31.320> and

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
sunny now getting that second Queen and

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.800 
sunny now getting that second Queen and
we<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.400> spine<00:03:32.730> crawler<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.600> spine

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
we see one spine crawler so that spine

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.810 
we see one spine crawler so that spine
crawler<00:03:34.019> most<00:03:34.260> likely<00:03:34.530> will<00:03:34.799> be<00:03:34.860> uprooted<00:03:35.489> and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
crawler most likely will be uprooted and

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.910 
crawler most likely will be uprooted and
then<00:03:36.150> transfer<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.720> over<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.680> spine

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
then transfer it over and the spine

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440 
then transfer it over and the spine
crawler<00:03:38.160> over<00:03:38.489> here<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.000> take<00:03:39.150> what

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
crawler over here going to take what

banshees<00:07:38.910> over<00:07:39.210> here<00:07:39.479> cloaking<00:07:40.290> and<00:07:40.470> getting

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
banshees over here cloaking and getting

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.940 
banshees over here cloaking and getting
a<00:07:41.130> lot<00:07:41.310> of<00:07:41.340> drone<00:07:41.669> kills<00:07:42.080> so<00:07:43.080> sunny<00:07:43.440> is<00:07:43.680> was

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:43.950 
a lot of drone kills so sunny is was

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.100 
a lot of drone kills so sunny is was
forced<00:07:44.280> to<00:07:44.370> say<00:07:44.520> GG<00:07:44.940> as<00:07:45.090> there<00:07:45.510> was<00:07:45.600> an<00:07:45.690> army<00:07:46.020> of

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
forced to say GG as there was an army of

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.930 
forced to say GG as there was an army of
hellions<00:07:46.320> sitting<00:07:46.800> down<00:07:46.919> over<00:07:47.130> here<00:07:47.280> I<00:07:47.460> think

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 
hellions sitting down over here I think

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.400 
hellions sitting down over here I think
that<00:07:48.060> the<00:07:48.180> army<00:07:48.510> of<00:07:48.600> hydraulics<00:07:49.050> could<00:07:49.290> have

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.410 
that the army of hydraulics could have

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.650 
that the army of hydraulics could have
been<00:07:49.530> able<00:07:49.680> to<00:07:49.830> take<00:07:50.070> down<00:07:50.250> these<00:07:50.400> banshees<00:07:50.910> if

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 
been able to take down these banshees if

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.659 
been able to take down these banshees if
Sonny<00:07:52.140> had<00:07:52.350> gotten<00:07:52.590> that<00:07:52.770> earlier<00:07:53.130> overseer

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
Sonny had gotten that earlier overseer

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.420 
Sonny had gotten that earlier overseer
so<00:07:54.000> a<00:07:54.180> little<00:07:55.020> bit<00:07:55.260> surprised<00:07:55.680> that<00:07:55.919> Sonny

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.430 
so a little bit surprised that Sonny

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.100 
so a little bit surprised that Sonny
didn't<00:07:56.760> even<00:07:57.030> move<00:07:57.240> his<00:07:57.300> army<00:07:57.750> to<00:07:57.780> try<00:07:58.050> to

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.110 
didn't even move his army to try to

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.080 
didn't even move his army to try to
respond<00:07:58.590> to<00:07:59.070> these<00:07:59.250> two<00:07:59.520> banshees<00:07:59.729> that<00:08:00.030> were

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.090 
respond to these two banshees that were

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.580 
respond to these two banshees that were
sitting<00:08:00.240> here<00:08:00.360> the<00:08:00.780> Banshees<00:08:01.169> didn't<00:08:01.470> get

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:01.590 
sitting here the Banshees didn't get

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.950 
sitting here the Banshees didn't get
that<00:08:01.860> many<00:08:02.100> more<00:08:02.340> kills<00:08:02.669> and<00:08:03.210> did<00:08:03.570> take<00:08:03.810> down

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 
that many more kills and did take down

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.840 
that many more kills and did take down
the<00:08:04.140> one<00:08:04.350> Queen<00:08:04.740> over<00:08:05.039> there<00:08:05.220> though<00:08:05.400> so

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:05.850 
the one Queen over there though so

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.310 
the one Queen over there though so
perhaps<00:08:06.060> that<00:08:06.360> was<00:08:06.450> the<00:08:06.570> issue<00:08:06.660> there<00:08:06.960> was<00:08:07.080> two

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.320 
perhaps that was the issue there was two

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.110 
perhaps that was the issue there was two
queens<00:08:07.620> left<00:08:07.770> and<00:08:08.010> for<00:08:08.220> hydrolyse<00:08:08.610> them
