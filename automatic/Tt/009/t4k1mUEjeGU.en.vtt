 hello and welcome to another 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.080
 foul of marius from macstories today 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.960
 show again at 17 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.780
 as you get purchases from free in app 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.289
 among other things which shows a gentleman 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.980
 at real racing 3 for example where it is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.330
 a lot of app purchases are unfortunately 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.660
 they have here ever 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.619
 first we have to go to celia 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.550
 need to look at each case study at 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.270
 best call the source 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 no that was not so good at apple 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 best to add reporter.net 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 how it all works show other videos 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.649
 also jpeg blabla invite us as 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 first of all, you have to have your own 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.260
 down or mobile police sap trade 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.910
 19 best again then the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.400
 down stairs install reload 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.630
 It's best to start each so soon 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.659
 still with reboot then you have to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 these two symbols have that something there 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:26.540
 because then give them a local 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.409
 each of you determines local apps store 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.970
 and his team still outbid again 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.130
 or jump start then we give 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.860
 the settings in and also see 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.700
 this is local eyed peas tor going on 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 labels and have done it 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.520
 then we can play a popular game 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.180
 States will not have to say soon 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 it does not work for everyone 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 so racing died here of horny sun 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.899
 because we asked for that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 is he server created my pc in 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.500
 simply hang this virtual server 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.710
 know yourself because of wifi 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.920
 so we have the goal and the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.410
 example, blabla know here to the money 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.260
 Buy click then just cancel 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.350
 and we have the 5000 whatever 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.209
 welcome 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.670
 that goes with this app store 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.520
 try others 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 that will be angry birds 2 star wars one 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.280
 to die away blabla bit luck basement 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.250
 make something like that here 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:40.390
 from angry birds this also knows 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.720
 not what texts first buy 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.720
 at credit the activity for 8 90 euro 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 and I do not think part of the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.430
 Problems do not go with every app i do 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.600
 can so far as pvz exercise so not 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.030
 right in the comments flame of 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.010
 put blabla it's not about packaging 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:12.130
 it's not everyone 's easy 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.130
 so 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.920
 it also needs to check loading content 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.800
 Well, no matter now , it works 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.000
 unfortunately not with any app so sell 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.000
 or buy a bullshit booster pack 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 abort, stop 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.290
 the way you see is not working 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.940
 like ten times already said home now 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.950
 I could have someone to try 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.260
 think there is advertising 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.910
 turn off 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.850
 Cancel ok 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
