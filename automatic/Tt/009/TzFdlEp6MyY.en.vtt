00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello very good kids that such as 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.630
 we are we are good are bad q I 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.580
 that I'm in another video in another final 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.249
 another screw this brings us ea 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.039
 this time it's the final guys the 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.960
 final cup they call her and good has 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.660
 already removed thanks to that end of the cup 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 America they got the chile against 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.700
 Argentina and I'm already seeing the team 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.460
 guys I've chosen to put bravo in 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.970
 goal and as you can see I have several 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.550
 Chileans who are viral Alexis and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.769
 hernandez that go very well and vargas in 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.499
 spear point is worth and as you can see also 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.050
 the rest would be Argentines we have put 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.559
 to zabaleta and side helmets 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.749
 otamendi cough that goes brutal angeleri 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.569
 central that is awesome the elf 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.850
 piatti as left end and zuculini 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.489
 in the middle guys I think it's a team 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.229
 pretty pretty beast and that about 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.030
 everything seems original to me because we have 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.679
 got together the same 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.620
 Pietro nationalities guys in the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:06.190
 bench villalba melano and the lord 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.830
 good central golf and good step fernandez 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.650
 navarrete of players that we were not going to 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 use removing that wind that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.390
 later it would have a very 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.570
 important guys here is the rival and 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.960
 fix is ​​not bad the rival has an omen 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.090
 in tip had also alexis tevez and 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.910
 Well, it's not bad, the team is going to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.070
 see what the meeting holds 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.540
 is piatti first good move that was going 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.240
 to do the goblin look how he gets 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.670
 inwards he plays for a zuculini and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.370
 good he was going to stop the rival goalkeeper with 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.470
 some 17th minute fortune and takes it 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.480
 Hernandez, guys, the pass is going very well 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.780
 great towards vargas like that could 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.720
 get good on top rises the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.100
 ball to vargas a shame guys the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.260
 we had a look at these plays 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.900
 hernandez who gets in and good play very 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.240
 controversial guys penalty that to me I do not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.860
 it seems I do not think it was in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.790
 first instance ok let's see now 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.470
 the repetition hits him and it seems that he 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 crosses in between 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.590
 and could it be to let me down in the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.440
 comments what seems to you 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.210
 let's see what makes vidal 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.470
 prepare there we are 32 minute match 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.530
 we could get ahead and look 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.500
 what is going to do vidal there is good 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.750
 cannonball hits them amazing guys that 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.690
 arturo vidal penalty and we put 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.110
 ahead in 32 minute let's see if 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 we managed to maintain that advantage because 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.640
 the truth that the penalty is executed is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.340
 great lord vidal and good guys 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 35 minute the opponent who wanted to leave but 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.830
 short let's go again there is vargas 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 vargas that hits him and egg or ball that 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 it goes up very well stuck by vargas 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.430
 again another attack guys now 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.050
 We were insisting a lot and look at 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.520
 the foul that the opponent is going to commit 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.130
 very far 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.160
 but what vidal asks the boys 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 Minute 38 ojito to the lack that is going to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.770
 run life and this mother of mine and 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.410
 then alexis head and he will catch his 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.380
 my mother goalkeeper missing and rotated 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.160
 vidal awesome guys good he 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.620
 attacked the rival 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.650
 anger that touches the half life to see very 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.720
 well the jose walk only time was going to stop 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.730
 bravo - my mother now here I had a 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720
 rival eye the rejection that takes it from 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.310
 new and finally we get that ball 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.920
 minute 44 guys on the edge of rest 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.170
 let's see that the rival now attacks not 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.870
 nothing happens and eye error in the delivery of 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.540
 helmet we give it to Alexis Agüero and goal 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.900
 my mother go fail we committed in the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.630
 minute 45 guys a pity just before 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.250
 of the rest to give that ball 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.220
 alexis who played for the kun and the kun 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.540
 I was not going to miss the opportunity 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.490
 set at rest two shots to six 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.200
 We deserved something more guys we deserved 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.650
 something else and we are going to make a change 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.900
 notice that we dominated the game and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.920
 I said good today I'm going to put that ticket 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.709
 let's put the seville tomo tm 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.290
 and I put him there on the half point and 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.540
 I think that is going to help a lot 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.260
 team in the second part let's see 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.840
 how is the second part we started 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.910
 as in the first with the minute ball 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.980
 70 and we guys take a lot but here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.079
 this life that remains only after 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.030
 of a perfect triangulation and goal that 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.400
 well define vidal guys look at the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.950
 pass that gets him vargas that is brutal 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.080
 is really vargas is a piece of 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.840
 incredible forward that well gives it 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.690
 vargas to viral and viral that will stick 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.220
 very good to the short stick you know that 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.700
 It is pretty mushroom or the shot to the stick 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.889
 short and minute 75 the opponent who tries 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.900
 leave again let's see if we can 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.970
 cut this play that paints badly very 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.530
 well cut yes sir 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.060
 and high eye of piatti my mother what's going 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.760
 to do the goblin there is going by 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.880
 band the elf now slows down hesitates a 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.010
 little bit and sees perfect vargas going to 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.740
 finish the crossbar but luckily 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.860
 comes to zuculini and in minute 78 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.249
 the 1 to 3 guys and a result that already 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.099
 appeared 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.969
 It was definitive and quoted as arrived 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:16.689
 culin and perfect and tops inside the 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.829
 goal boys minutes 78 1 to 3 rival 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.469
 what does it mean? 

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:23.739
 eye mother makes me the kicker that 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.079
 paste here to the kun with central angeleri to 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:28.809
 two guys eye tevez I do the bitch 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:33.129
 of putting myself under the pole and not even with those 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:36.189
 mothers I came to guys minute 81 they put the 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:38.499
 rival much sauce much emotion to these 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.749
 last 10 minutes with that piece of 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:43.029
 free direct from tve but good fixos 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.309
 guys this is a good move by tipa 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.769
 attentive there is open wind that is 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.809
 goes to alexis para paralisis for vargas 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:52.629
 vargas sanchez 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:55.719
 there is old man who is going to hit him and goal 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:58.239
 there are kids like a great goal tie 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:01.209
 play nothing of just running forward 

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:04.389
 nothing to do the crazy goat played 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:05.709
 combinative lovely touch guys are 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.329
 remains alone 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.920
 I think this goal deserves like that because 

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:13.100
 it also gives us go 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.290
 the title and sure there were only four 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.620
 minutes of game and good look steals 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.270
 vargas makes it spectacularly perfect the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.150
 boarding the goblin and the goblin that 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.580
 Mark guys the final 5-2 the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.460
 marker that was not going to move anymore and 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.160
 thank you thanks to vargas what 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.500
 nice does it to mage three times and up 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.320
 who gives the pass and then the goblin who does not 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.780
 fails guys 25 we were going to take this 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.000
 this title of the final cup os 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.160
 I recommend a lot of kids that 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.190
 do with a team similar to the one 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.530
 I have made a good team 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.320
 I have of the two nationalities I 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.450
 faced against teams that had 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.060
 everything but I think a very team 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.670
 original and that is not excessively expensive 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.280
 it's worth removing that otamendi look 11 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.380
 shots to 4 finally and we're going to open that 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.420
 about guys let's see 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.120
 we could have a little bit of luck in 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.910
 that envelope to round out this grand finale 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.420
 that we have won 52 eyes good 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.850
 samba 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.610
 and you see guys a pretty envelope 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.770
 pretty bad the only drinkable thing about the envelope 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.320
 it's maybe that toni kross that not even 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.840
 worth nothing but good is the best he has 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.180
 come out so I'll leave it there in 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.410
 screen and you know guys I hope that 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.870
 I have molado the video I think it has been 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.220
 a great match the truth and good to leave 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.630
 quite in like to support these 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.180
 final that I really like 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.070
 quite up the get to get to the 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.500
 end win it and bring that envelope 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.660
