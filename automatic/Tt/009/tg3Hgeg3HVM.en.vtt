00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.410
 and 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:25.599
 let's start this day depending on 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.599
 the initial effects 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 well here we have a pedal board with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.620
 analog effects of really and I'm going to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.620
 explain another move quickly as 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.170
 works on the pedalboard the guitar of the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 signal enters here at the entrance to the jetta and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.229
 to the input and from here it also starts 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 the effects chain goes pedal 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.879
 volume that we have here the ying 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.180
 download that is an excellent pedal 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.949
 volume can cut the entire signal or 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 can stay in the middle and keeps 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.119
 the same level of profit the same 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.720
 saturation level of effects do not cut 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 nothing stays the same after the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.750
 signal to this pedal chromatic tunnel that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.119
 has several tuning modes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.800
 really this pedal can be tuned 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.080
 bass guitar with micro tones 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.569
 microfilming and it's very good it's very 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.630
 advisable this truth we have also 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:36.600
 there is no voice suppressor also that is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.020
 what this pedal does the signal enters and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.020
 clean 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.460
 here the accused then goes and will go 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.229
 to the compressor to overdrive to this pedal 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.549
 flex milestone although it's also another kind of 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.060
 overdrive is a simulator of 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.880
 martial amplifier and returns and returns 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.069
 again dating by the wii signal 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.990
 train and the center then what is it 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.170
 does this is not super close and short 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.789
 all the noise that these effects give 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.509
 usually all the pedals 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:10.179
 compression the distortion pedals and 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.329
 the overdrives give a lot of noise 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.560
 then it cuts all those effects 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:20.110
 they have several various types of adjustment the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.840
 3 cabbage that is from the threshold the dike 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.489
 then the threshold shows us how much 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 signal is coming in and we're going to let 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.410
 between saturated and the dike is how much 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.510
 signal will be cut after it passes 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.420
 for this effect in other words it is 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.640
 like when you enter through a door 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 everything that enters through the door is 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.540
 adjusts world connectors and everything 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.579
 out of that door with this dam 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.879
 so here we say how 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.400
 after I touch 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.319
 the signal saturated or with noise and it cuts 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.590
 that's what makes this no surprise 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.860
 then it is advisable to always have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.110
 on when we are using 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.560
 guitars with distortion or with a 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.530
 compressor 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.510
 then pass the area to the compressor this 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 pedal is a compression your techniques by 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.250
 example in the general mix when 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.760
 you're playing with bass with drums 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.450
 keyboards and so on the guitar by putting 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.220
 the compressor enhances the frequencies 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.140
 of the guitar I already know that it stays in 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.760
 the same line what you touch more 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.170
 strong remain the same and what 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.590
 softer touches remain the same 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.980
 line and it was much more presence to the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 guitar and the ils you that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.959
 is here also makes the note last 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.660
 a little more hold that note there 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.900
 and we have this pedal that is a classic 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.090
 of nine sounded from the overdrive this 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.310
 I think it's one of the most pedals 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.269
 mythical that there is because it has been used 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.459
 by countless groups and has marked a 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.920
 great stage in rock music 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.739
 they especially made several groups and 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.280
 gives a very warm sound has only three 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.380
 buttons 33 losses that is the adjustment of the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.170
 drive that really is what gives the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.010
 distortion could be said 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.880
 or the gain has the tone that opens 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.200
 between the most opaque and the brightest and 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:21.370
 has the level that is of the volume this 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.040
 emulates the sound of a march of 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 a work is much more loaded with this 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.820
 you can touch styles 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.430
 and that range from the alternative bronze 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.860
 metal up stronger things but 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.470
 He also has a bust that only 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.350
 operate for example the shore of 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.160
 Bust goes up the level and can be used 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:49.710
 for solos for treatment arrangements with the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.790
 4.5 gustÃ­n level the boost knob that 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.610
 increases the level of gain the level 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.050
 that this setting generates the level of 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.639
 volume of these two inputs 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:07.000
 in crunch and the high game this plan is 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:10.539
 for the rhythmic triggers but with 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.690
 a march style presence have high 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.659
 game that already gives a bit distortion 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.210
 stronger you can use the two there 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.909
 I'm using the driving range when 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.099
 I put select the two are used and 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.770
 obviously the mistress of all that 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.930
 You can use these murals by mixing 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.169
 the in different ways for example the 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.810
 Lebanese with the like 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.600
 so that the xolos or the fixes 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.320
 noten 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.510
 and we finally have the delay this delay 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.270
 and it already leaves the chain of no and its 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.070
 pressure comes comes directly from the 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.780
 our price is already connected when 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.950
 the signal comes out of these three pedals 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.350
 comes from here and and digital delay of 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:59.910
 of 7 voice which is excellent that of 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.810
 vilei has different modes of laws of 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.840
 in reverse of laws with modulation 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.370
 etcetera and also has the advantage of 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.450
 that can be connected this pedal cited 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.840
 this is a piano role but that 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:18.810
 It serves to pay to give the time to 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.760
 to the id a song to follow the time 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.640
 that marks the metronome that marks the 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.640
 drummer and adjusts the delay here 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.300
 and finally we have the equalizer this 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:34.099
 it's a wonder this g7 because it helps 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.559
 really mark the frequencies that one 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.229
 he wants them to be on the electric guitar 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:41.749
 when we play with a band is not what 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:44.089
 same as playing in my own room in 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:46.490
 my room I want it to sound like a 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.139
 way you can feel the boats 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.849
 and the brightness of my guitar and I do 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.759
 different things but many times 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.229
 how much a band is lost because 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.629
 because I'm using the same 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.550
 frequencies that is the bass and they use 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.619
 other instruments 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.509
 so I must do the 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:05.889
 frequencies that really my guitar 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:09.939
 use and I do it with this criminal 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.939
 then general
