00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.940
 and the sassenheimers conversation to work or vincent and feel i'm going to start 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.170
 Let me first say that I have completely left wisdom teeth 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.590
 and I have some swellings, she may be me 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.450
 it sounds a bit strange that I sound football and can't do well 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 apologize for that but we are going to start now the first is already going 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 for call of duty every year there is of course a plan study game and so on 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.199
 again this year it seems the regime that has released a trailer this week 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 which shows that he is already in the food newspaper and ceo van slachteren 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.950
 and I think going on November 4 for the export is not football 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.050
 they have not yet announced other platforms there, but there is a chance 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 of course quite large that he will also play for the twitter pfff in 2003 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.740
 but what is culture of athletes other name it says it is really a lake 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.330
 advanced warfare can prohibit the playing field much more 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.210
 as black ops we are in the future off namely in the year 2054 in this year 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.870
 a kind of global disadvantage thereof occurred where the 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.259
 several terrorist attacks 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.159
 in several major cities in the world the main character is the former soldier 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 more sol and he gets an offer from some partner that there is a buyer 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.020
 built-in atlas corpore sano what the offer to join them 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.749
 close it is a fully fledged not quite known because say the player 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:24.719
 The Scissor Pirate is selling Herpen organizations that is employed by 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.010
 american government 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.270
 where this organization has 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.310
 excel set trends and that's what a culture that is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.360
 it becomes something really unimportant is going to be names that 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.220
 texel go-karts perhaps know it a bit from taiwan fall but this excel 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.659
 since cultivation, the player gives the opportunity to jump much higher 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960
 than a normal person that could 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.850
 they can be better clemmons to be able this can take ten slide and they can even 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.650
 Ours become visible from a short time making them this surface from behind 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.570
 can decide but that excelsior that will really become something important 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.950
 you have to be a lot of money users 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.980
 researched but you can say the case of the world where it is very often 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.470
 prevented in the end I almost never came for you can almost never controlled 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.399
 maybe that is also what the exeo sends 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.499
 but yes, she really goes there 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.629
 Quite brand in the future play much more very apples very technology it 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.809
 Gaming used in this new Rudy coach however this one was also said 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.599
 that for this culture that turned a new and dennis myself I doubt that 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.900
 Turkish attacker will be the coach Rudi Diels said 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.740
 in the end it turned out that language is not the case 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.070
 but as in the beginning zeidi game goes on March 4 deceased bobby 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.720
 fortiseffect won nothing for it 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.890
 and probably 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.560
 ready let's say of course 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.920
 you can also go out exactly in the image 4 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.830
 and a computer we continue with mass effect of course the man spectra logic 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.290
 is over but it does not mean that the mass effect universe is far from it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.339
 is over 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.519
 apparently names have announced the development of a new carrot 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.110
 game 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.300
 so that the ball still floats universe 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.769
 is halfway through development 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.719
 as far as I am concerned, it is very good news that appointments are great 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.769
 sandvik are series and i really can't wait for apple's new mast a game 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.760
 is coming out 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.710
 and but I wonder what they will do with that of characters and that kind 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.509
 things that led van gaal 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.209
 so that will naturally be seen as a therapist I may have shot myself 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.389
 at the end of next year that it came out we could just go with it 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.329
 see these 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.130
 it is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.070
 Sold 2 million times and of course talk about the design students 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.599
 version 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.979
 and to be honest I have learned to play a little the last few days 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:33.579
 and 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.549
 actually the game is best on paper to mark empel the zero comma zero spice girl 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.200
 You can still cook a chain, and certainly drive a vehicle 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.209
 take them all and it plays 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.489
 besson is actually right I wonder how many of you are players on this one 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.820
 if your duels are played m 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.370
 if you have stopped playing why is that like me you will find the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.979
 control 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.030
 just sucks 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.270
 let performances know what they want let us know in the comments very curious 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.160
 to van amerongen that the latest news to get started imam the testing 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.809
 last week of course also considering the details that were announced 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:12.219
 however, this has announced that it will invest half a billion dollars 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.639
 in best with it 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 fine of a million dollars 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.919
 what then where should they all invest that they are supposed to 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.419
 advice intended for development 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.060
 the marketing and infrastructure of the game and that is of course really one 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.999
 breeding gigantically large assignments would go the foundation the project 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:32.930
 ever but that ball lets it go that it will turn out well and that it will 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.669
 to keep going is reflecting in the quality of the game I have you 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.389
 so much out but the game he is talking about the price the weather is not good plan 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.060
 technical problems were found for the short term 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.230
 am allowed to go out now 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.440
 and tom beans once 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.970
 later on
