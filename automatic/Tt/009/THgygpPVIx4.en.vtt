undervalued yippi-yaw so where there's
always<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.140> friction<00:01:29.680> them<00:01:29.890> these<00:01:30.520> are

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
always that friction them these are

price<00:01:33.280> it's<00:01:34.270> not<00:01:34.390> based<00:01:34.659> on<00:01:34.780> land<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.229> course

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
price it's not based on land of course

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.389 
price it's not based on land of course
so<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.840> that's<00:01:38.110> where<00:01:38.320> all<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.590> friction

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
so so that's where all the friction

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.260 
so so that's where all the friction
