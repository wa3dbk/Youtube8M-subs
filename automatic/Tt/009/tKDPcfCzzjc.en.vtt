was<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> second<00:01:42.030> ago<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.450> may<00:01:43.380> take<00:01:43.590> its

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
was just a second ago and may take its

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
was just a second ago and may take its
time<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> should<00:01:44.610> give<00:01:44.880> us<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> salty<00:01:45.840> as

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
time but that should give us a salty as

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.249 
time but that should give us a salty as
you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.340> now<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> we'll<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
you can see right now so we'll just

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
you can see right now so we'll just
leave<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:50.520> we'll

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
leave that to do that just now we'll

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
leave that to do that just now we'll

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
like that or move on to the next thing

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.790 
like that or move on to the next thing
okay<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.630> next<00:02:33.690> thing<00:02:33.960> we<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.200> here<00:02:34.410> is

okay so the next thing we have here is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.640 
okay so the next thing we have here is
quite<00:02:35.100> smart<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.000> called<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:37.110> slain<00:02:37.380> bowl

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
quite smart it is called the slain bowl

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.680 
quite smart it is called the slain bowl
and<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.490> know<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.970> things<00:02:39.120> they<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.570> be

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and as you know some things they can be

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
and as you know some things they can be
very<00:02:39.720> very<00:02:40.260> tricky<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.860> find<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.700> mod<00:02:41.970> allows

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
very very tricky to find this mod allows

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.180 
very very tricky to find this mod allows
you<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.510> actually<00:02:42.660> craft<00:02:43.140> them<00:02:43.410> all<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> do

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
you to actually craft them all you to do

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.430 
you to actually craft them all you to do
is<00:02:44.250> put<00:02:44.490> one<00:02:44.670> milk<00:02:44.910> clicks<00:02:45.210> or<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.350> also

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
is put one milk clicks or you can also

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.530 
is put one milk clicks or you can also
do<00:02:46.590> some<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.100> obey<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.460> grid<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.150> put<00:02:48.360> one

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
do some to obey to grid you put one

you have redstone and there you have to

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.759 
you have redstone and there you have to
gunpowder<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.080> that's<00:03:49.200> quite<00:03:49.320> an<00:03:49.470> easy<00:03:49.560> way<00:03:49.739> to

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
gunpowder so that's quite an easy way to

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.190 
gunpowder so that's quite an easy way to
do<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.190> also<00:03:50.489> gives<00:03:50.670> gravel<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.300> good<00:03:51.930> purpose

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
do it also gives gravel a good purpose

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.430 
do it also gives gravel a good purpose
and<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.910> know<00:03:54.030> gravel<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.570> pretty<00:03:54.870> crap<00:03:55.230> in

corners now on every corner and you put
a<00:04:36.720> register<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.260> right<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.440> like<00:04:37.800> sooo

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
a register on the right just like sooo

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.730 
a register on the right just like sooo
north<00:04:39.870> west<00:04:40.260> east<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.220> south<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.450> also<00:04:43.320> UPR

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
get ender pearls and so this diamond as

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.530 
get ender pearls and so this diamond as
you<00:04:49.470> can<00:04:49.560> see<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.640> that's<00:04:50.820> how<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.000> me<00:04:51.240> get<00:04:51.420> the
