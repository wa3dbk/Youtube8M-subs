00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
will range up to 700 they will top up at

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.340 
will range up to 700 they will top up at

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
700 but this one is 1.3 megapixel which

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.280 
700 but this one is 1.3 megapixel which
means<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.700> thousand<00:04:29.420> TV<00:04:30.080> lines

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
metal metal case metal case means it's

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.860 
metal metal case metal case means it's
durable<00:04:39.800> it's<00:04:40.010> weatherproof<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:41.360> can<00:04:41.540> use<00:04:41.720> it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
durable it's weatherproof you can use it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.960 
durable it's weatherproof you can use it
outdoors<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.770> can<00:04:42.800> install<00:04:43.310> it<00:04:43.490> indoors<00:04:43.820> as

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
outdoors you can install it indoors as

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.430 
outdoors you can install it indoors as
well<00:04:44.120> another<00:04:44.390> thing<00:04:44.540> that<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.870> noticed<00:04:45.290> is

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
well another thing that I noticed is

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.790 
well another thing that I noticed is
that<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.920> could<00:04:46.100> do<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.220> worm<00:04:46.550> with<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:47.380> now<00:04:48.380> you

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
that you could do a worm with it now you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.980 
that you could do a worm with it now you
could<00:04:48.980> basically<00:04:49.240> install<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.419> anywhere<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
could basically install it anywhere you

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.250 
could basically install it anywhere you
want<00:04:51.230> in<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.620> ceiling<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.910> wall<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.510> if<00:04:54.140> you

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
want in a ceiling on the wall and if you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.110 
want in a ceiling on the wall and if you
want<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.530> look<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.830> your<00:04:54.860> right<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.790> do<00:04:55.940> this

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
want to look to your right you do this

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.030 
want to look to your right you do this
now<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.860> rotate<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.460> base<00:04:58.669> like<00:04:59.480> this<00:05:00.040> and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
now so you rotate the base like this and

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.430 
now so you rotate the base like this and
then<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.730> can<00:05:01.970> rotate<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.510> camera<00:05:02.540> and<00:05:03.169> you

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
then you can rotate the camera and you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.680 
then you can rotate the camera and you
have<00:05:03.650> all<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.250> viewing<00:05:04.580> angle<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.360> can<00:05:05.540> also

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
have all the viewing angle you can also

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.530 
have all the viewing angle you can also
rotate<00:05:06.050> this<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.980> angle<00:05:07.640> view<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.510> you

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
rotate this this angle view so you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.409 
rotate this this angle view so you
always<00:05:08.900> cover<00:05:09.380> with<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.770> angle<00:05:10.280> angle<00:05:11.000> of

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
always cover with this angle angle of

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.930 
always cover with this angle angle of
view<00:05:11.990> for<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.410> camera<00:05:12.770> another<00:05:13.550> thing<00:05:13.790> is

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
view for this camera another thing is

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.659 
view for this camera another thing is
that<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.570> infrared<00:05:15.230> you<00:05:15.950> will<00:05:16.160> be<00:05:16.310> able<00:05:16.460> to

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
that the infrared you will be able to

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.570 
that the infrared you will be able to
see<00:05:16.970> up<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.419> hundred<00:05:17.990> feet<00:05:18.290> at<00:05:18.800> night<00:05:18.860> well

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
see up to a hundred feet at night well

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.240 
see up to a hundred feet at night well
meaning<00:05:19.790> total<00:05:20.360> darkness<00:05:20.660> just<00:05:21.320> like<00:05:21.560> Batman

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
meaning total darkness just like Batman

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.700 
meaning total darkness just like Batman
you<00:05:22.550> know<00:05:22.729> like<00:05:23.000> total<00:05:23.660> darkness<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.470> walk

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.980 
you know like total darkness you walk
you<00:05:25.130> fall<00:05:25.430> why<00:05:26.000> because<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.540> don't<00:05:26.660> have<00:05:26.840> an

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
you fall why because you don't have an

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.340 
you fall why because you don't have an
infrared<00:05:27.290> camera<00:05:27.440> as<00:05:27.919> your<00:05:28.130> eyes<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.910> know<00:05:29.060> a
