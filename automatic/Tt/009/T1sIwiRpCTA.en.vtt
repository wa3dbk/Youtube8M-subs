00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
they're actually a little bit flexible

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.830 
they're actually a little bit flexible
because<00:01:53.289> they're<00:01:53.499> so<00:01:53.710> small<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.210> we're<00:01:55.749> going

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840

a little bit of sock yarn so let's begin

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.900 
a little bit of sock yarn so let's begin
to<00:02:13.630> begin<00:02:13.960> what<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.350> want<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.620> do<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.670> want

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
to thread the needle we're going to be

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.430 
to thread the needle we're going to be
putting<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.640> beads<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.030> first<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.810> then

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
putting the beads on first and then

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.000 
putting the beads on first and then
we'll<00:02:20.680> add

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
we'll add

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.630 
we'll add
them<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.370> our<00:02:21.459> project<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.560> whenever<00:02:24.280> you're

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
them to our project so whenever you're

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.490 
them to our project so whenever you're
threading<00:02:24.970> something<00:02:25.569> with<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> small<00:02:26.230> eye

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
threading something with a small eye

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.770 
threading something with a small eye
iLike<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.370> give<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.730> fresh<00:02:28.000> cut<00:02:28.299> makes

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
iLike to just give it a fresh cut makes

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.830 
iLike to just give it a fresh cut makes
it<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.019> little<00:02:29.140> easier<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.700> get<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:30.970> through<00:02:33.840> so

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it a little easier to get it through so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.619 
it a little easier to get it through so
there's<00:02:35.019> kind<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.409> a<00:02:35.560> fine<00:02:35.590> line<00:02:35.890> between<00:02:36.629> the

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
there's kind of a fine line between the

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.960 
there's kind of a fine line between the
small<00:02:38.049> eye<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.680> getting<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:39.159> yarn<00:02:39.489> through

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
small eye of getting your yarn through

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.220 
small eye of getting your yarn through
and<00:02:40.379> passing<00:02:41.379> it<00:02:41.530> through<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.069> hole<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and passing it through the hole of the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.670 
and passing it through the hole of the
bead<00:02:44.650> sometimes<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.849> hole<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:47.140> eye<00:02:47.349> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
bead sometimes the hole of the eye of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.729 
bead sometimes the hole of the eye of
the<00:02:47.799> needle<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:48.629> too<00:02:49.629> small<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.140> fit<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.500> yarn

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the needle is too small to fit the yarn

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.250 
the needle is too small to fit the yarn
but<00:02:51.609> okay<00:02:52.030> with<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.329> beads<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.810> vice<00:02:52.930> versa

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
but okay with the beads and vice versa

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.949 
but okay with the beads and vice versa
so<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.459> want<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.760> make<00:02:55.060> sure<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.720> works

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
so you want to make sure that it works

those on there and let's do about six of
them<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.920> your<00:03:18.220> project<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:18.970> you're<00:03:19.239> doing

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.210 

and<00:04:24.350> sometimes<00:04:25.350> you'll<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.830> push<00:04:26.040> them

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
and sometimes you'll have to push them

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:33.400 
and sometimes you'll have to push them
back<00:04:26.400> even<00:04:26.430> farther<00:04:27.000> as<00:04:27.390> you're<00:04:27.600> working<00:04:31.580> and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
back even farther as you're working and

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.810 
back even farther as you're working and
like<00:04:34.410> I<00:04:34.560> said<00:04:34.620> I'm<00:04:34.860> just<00:04:34.890> working<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.580> little

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
like I said I'm just working a little

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.780 
like I said I'm just working a little
row<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.060> single<00:04:36.450> crochet<00:04:37.020> just<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.670> give<00:04:38.670> us

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
row of single crochet just to give us

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.470 
row of single crochet just to give us
something<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.390> hang<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.200> here<00:04:42.470> and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
something to hang on to here and

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.810 
something to hang on to here and
sometimes<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.900> wanted<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.200> also<00:04:46.440> say<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:47.400> it's

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
sometimes I wanted to also say that it's

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.240 
sometimes I wanted to also say that it's
sometimes<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.420> hard<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.870> pre<00:04:49.260> estimate<00:04:49.890> how

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
sometimes it's hard to pre estimate how

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.500 
sometimes it's hard to pre estimate how
many<00:04:50.310> beads<00:04:50.700> you're<00:04:50.940> going<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.120> need<00:04:51.270> for<00:04:51.480> your

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
many beads you're going to need for your

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.430 
many beads you're going to need for your
project<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.980> my<00:04:53.970> advice<00:04:54.300> is<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.570> always<00:04:55.020> put

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
project so my advice is to always put

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.410 
project so my advice is to always put
much<00:04:56.160> more<00:04:56.490> than<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:56.850> you'll<00:04:57.270> need

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
much more than you think you'll need

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.250 
much more than you think you'll need
because<00:04:57.750> it's<00:04:57.990> easier<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:59.840> have<00:05:00.840> too<00:05:01.080> many

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
because it's easier to have too many

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.860 
because it's easier to have too many
than<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.800> run<00:05:01.980> out<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:03.300> we've<00:05:03.450> just<00:05:03.480> made<00:05:03.720> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
than to run out so we've just made a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.460

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
your loop the bead is still behind your

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.510 
your loop the bead is still behind your
hook<00:05:50.850> like<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.770> you'll<00:05:52.770> pull<00:05:53.070> up<00:05:53.220> a<00:05:53.340> loop

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
hook like that you'll pull up a loop

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.370 
hook like that you'll pull up a loop
whatever<00:05:54.240> you<00:05:54.390> can<00:05:54.540> do<00:05:54.600> this<00:05:54.750> with<00:05:54.900> any<00:05:55.050> stitch

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380

whatever you can do this with any stitch
really<00:05:55.590> and<00:05:56.720> then<00:05:57.720> you'll<00:05:57.870> finish<00:05:58.020> working

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
really and then you'll finish working

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.250 
really and then you'll finish working
your<00:05:58.590> stitch<00:05:58.830> just<00:05:59.160> as<00:05:59.310> you<00:05:59.430> normally<00:05:59.850> one

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
your stitch just as you normally one

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.530 
your stitch just as you normally one
doesn't<00:06:01.260> really<00:06:01.290> interfere<00:06:01.710> with<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.540> so

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
doesn't really interfere with that so

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.780 
doesn't really interfere with that so
and<00:06:03.960> then<00:06:04.260> if<00:06:04.410> you<00:06:04.500> flip<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.830> over<00:06:04.980> you<00:06:05.610> can<00:06:05.640> see

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
and then if you flip it over you can see

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.120 
and then if you flip it over you can see
the<00:06:06.390> bead<00:06:07.250> has<00:06:08.250> been<00:06:08.550> added<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.180> your<00:06:09.510> project

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
the bead has been added to your project

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.010 
the bead has been added to your project
so<00:06:11.130> let's<00:06:11.340> do<00:06:11.520> that<00:06:11.700> again<00:06:12.000> I'll<00:06:12.240> put<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.720> stitch

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
so let's do that again I'll put a stitch

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.510 
so let's do that again I'll put a stitch
in<00:06:13.050> between<00:06:13.530> just<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:13.830> give<00:06:13.980> us<00:06:14.010> a<00:06:14.220> little<00:06:14.340> bit

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
in between just to give us a little bit

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.180 
in between just to give us a little bit
of<00:06:14.640> space<00:06:14.910> so<00:06:15.210> we're<00:06:16.020> going<00:06:16.140> to<00:06:16.200> go<00:06:16.320> into<00:06:16.650> our

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
of space so we're going to go into our

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.730 
of space so we're going to go into our
next<00:06:17.220> stitch<00:06:17.790> so<00:06:18.660> let's<00:06:18.870> slide<00:06:19.260> a<00:06:19.290> bead<00:06:19.620> up

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
next stitch so let's slide a bead up

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.250 
next stitch so let's slide a bead up
from<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.890> back<00:06:23.040> here<00:06:23.960> then<00:06:24.960> we're<00:06:25.080> going<00:06:25.200> to

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
from the back here then we're going to

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.710 
from the back here then we're going to
push<00:06:26.010> it<00:06:26.160> up<00:06:26.340> against<00:06:26.760> our<00:06:26.850> Hulk<00:06:27.090> as<00:06:27.270> far<00:06:27.600> as

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
push it up against our Hulk as far as

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.560 
push it up against our Hulk as far as
it'll<00:06:27.960> go<00:06:27.990> in<00:06:29.150> and<00:06:30.150> then<00:06:30.240> we're<00:06:30.330> going<00:06:30.419> to<00:06:30.479> go

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
it'll go in and then we're going to go

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.200 
it'll go in and then we're going to go
into<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.960> stitch<00:06:31.460> work<00:06:32.460> the<00:06:32.669> stitches<00:06:32.940> we

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
into the stitch work the stitches we

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.029 
into the stitch work the stitches we
normally<00:06:33.630> would<00:06:33.840> keeping<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.500> bead<00:06:34.740> back

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
normally would keeping that bead back

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:35.510 
normally would keeping that bead back
there

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
there

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.850 
there
and<00:06:36.500> there<00:06:37.500> is<00:06:37.680> our<00:06:38.569> second<00:06:39.569> bead<00:06:39.990> added<00:06:40.740> to

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.580 
and there is our second bead added to
our<00:06:40.889> project<00:06:41.780> so<00:06:42.780> let's<00:06:42.810> do<00:06:43.139> that<00:06:43.289> one<00:06:43.560> more

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590

washed<00:07:20.130> these<00:07:20.550> are<00:07:20.729> glass<00:07:21.000> so<00:07:21.659> they're<00:07:22.199> okay

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050
