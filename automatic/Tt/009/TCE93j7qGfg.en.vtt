the<00:00:32.829> flesh<00:00:33.760> off<00:00:34.059> from<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.390> peel<00:00:34.719> so<00:00:35.350> Ted<00:00:35.980> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
halfway through butchering a delicious

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.250 
halfway through butchering a delicious
organic<00:00:49.510> melon<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:51.360> Stephen<00:00:52.360> stepped<00:00:52.630> in<00:00:52.870> and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
organic melon and Stephen stepped in and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.530 
organic melon and Stephen stepped in and
I<00:00:53.920> had<00:00:54.490> no<00:00:54.640> clue<00:00:54.790> there<00:00:54.970> was<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.180> right<00:00:55.390> or<00:00:55.510> wrong

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
I had no clue there was a right or wrong

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.819 
I had no clue there was a right or wrong
way<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.900> cut<00:00:56.079> him<00:00:56.200> out<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.470> used<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.680> just

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
way to cut him out and I used to just

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.190 
way to cut him out and I used to just
quarter<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.340> scoop<00:00:57.670> out<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.880> seeds<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:59.020> for

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
quarter it scoop out the seeds go for

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.130 
quarter it scoop out the seeds go for
the<00:00:59.260> scan<00:00:59.530> and<00:01:00.090> figured<00:01:01.090> that<00:01:01.329> a<00:01:01.570> good<00:01:01.960> chunk

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
the scan and figured that a good chunk

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.479 
the scan and figured that a good chunk
of<00:01:02.260> flesh<00:01:02.380> was<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.010> price<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.310> pay<00:01:03.460> for

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
of flesh was the price you pay for

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.030 
of flesh was the price you pay for
people<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.970> melon<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.479> then<00:01:04.680> Stephen<00:01:05.680> shed

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
people to melon and then Stephen shed

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.580 
people to melon and then Stephen shed
the<00:01:06.220> light<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:07.270> realized<00:01:07.869> there's<00:01:08.530> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
the light and I realized there's a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.649 
the light and I realized there's a
better<00:01:08.890> way<00:01:09.100> there's<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.580> path<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.390> less

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
better way there's a path of less

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.230 
better way there's a path of less
existence<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.409> path<00:01:11.680> less<00:01:12.070> fees<00:01:12.310> well<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:13.150> know

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
existence a path less fees well you know

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.330 
existence a path less fees well you know

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
you just want to practice this technique

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.070 
you just want to practice this technique
so<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.100> get<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> maximum<00:04:07.730> amount<00:04:07.790> of<00:04:08.080> good
