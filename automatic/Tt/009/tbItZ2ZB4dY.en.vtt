here at the Royal Geographical Society
of<00:00:38.579> probably<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.300> most<00:00:39.480> important<00:00:39.989> part<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of probably the most important part of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
of probably the most important part of
this<00:00:40.350> journey<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.219> way<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> we'll<00:00:41.700> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this journey there the way that we'll be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.779 
this journey there the way that we'll be
identifying<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.680> key<00:00:43.890> vistas<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> sites

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
identifying the key vistas and sites

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.869 
identifying the key vistas and sites
than<00:00:45.030> we'd<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> visit<00:00:45.600> along<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> route

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
than we'd like to visit along the route

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.130 
than we'd like to visit along the route
the<00:00:47.879> idea<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> using<00:00:48.329> historic<00:00:48.840> imagery

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the idea of using historic imagery

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
the idea of using historic imagery
allows<00:00:49.410> us<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> landscape<00:00:50.940> change

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
allows us to but that landscape change

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.670 
allows us to but that landscape change
over<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.570> larger<00:00:51.750> time<00:00:52.110> scale<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
over a much larger time scale than the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.150 
over a much larger time scale than the
contemporary<00:00:53.430> methods<00:00:53.640> alone<00:00:57.649> we've<00:00:58.649> come<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
contemporary methods alone we've come to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
contemporary methods alone we've come to

perfect<00:01:44.460> science<00:01:44.640> enabler<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.299> guess<00:01:45.740> we'll

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
perfect science enabler I guess we'll

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.889 
perfect science enabler I guess we'll
have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> roof<00:01:47.670> rack<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> top<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
have a roof rack on the top and the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.990 
have a roof rack on the top and the
targets<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.040> we'll<00:01:50.159> launch<00:01:50.729> our

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
targets there from so we'll launch our

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
targets there from so we'll launch our

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
will provide a stable base but we'll use

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.780
