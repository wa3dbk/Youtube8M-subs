we'll be looking at here is the top
right<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.200> that's<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.099> boost

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369

feature<00:02:08.860> what<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.039> does<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.729> it

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
feature what this does is that it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.550 
feature what this does is that it
changes<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.450> initial<00:02:11.930> amount<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.230> braking

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
changes the initial amount of braking

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.680 
changes the initial amount of braking

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
five percent above normal and then it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
five percent above normal and then it
will<00:02:23.090> keep<00:02:23.299> going<00:02:23.510> through<00:02:23.959> as<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.230> more

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
here is on the left side you have these

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.819 
here is on the left side you have these
up<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.480> down<00:02:29.630> arrows<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.560> will<00:02:30.739> do

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
up and down arrows and what this will do

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.650 
up and down arrows and what this will do
is<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.069> was<00:02:31.250> at<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.400> maximum<00:02:32.000> output<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.540> the

is this was at the maximum output to the

is this was at the maximum output to the

trailer brakes the goal this is to

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.910 
trailer brakes the goal this is to
prevent<00:02:35.480> locking<00:02:35.989> up<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> trailer<00:02:36.680> tires

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
prevent locking up the trailer tires

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.420 
prevent locking up the trailer tires
with<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> brakes<00:02:37.579> when<00:02:38.450> you're<00:02:38.600> at<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:39.470> really

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
with the brakes when you're at a really

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.479 
with the brakes when you're at a really
high<00:02:40.640> pressure<00:02:41.209> braking<00:02:41.930> situation<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.430> just

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
high pressure braking situation you just

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.059 
high pressure braking situation you just
set<00:02:43.819> this<00:02:44.030> we're<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.139> down<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.530> voltage<00:02:45.889> and

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
set this we're going down in voltage and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.849 
set this we're going down in voltage and
that<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.370> less<00:02:46.730> pressure<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.530> if<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.680> go<00:02:48.829> up

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
that is less pressure and if you go up

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.979 
that is less pressure and if you go up
that<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.489> more<00:02:49.730> pressure<00:02:50.000> Tekonsha<00:02:50.660> gives<00:02:50.870> a

while<00:03:38.120> driving<00:03:38.470> give<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.500> quick<00:03:39.770> example<00:03:40.280> of

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
while driving give a quick example of

while driving give a quick example of
that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.750 
that
so<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.320> disconnected<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.070> blue<00:03:43.340> wire<00:03:43.550> that

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
so I disconnected the blue wire that

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.280 
so I disconnected the blue wire that
will<00:03:43.880> run<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.180> brake<00:03:44.360> signal<00:03:44.600> from<00:03:45.110> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
will run the brake signal from the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.620 
will run the brake signal from the
vehicle<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.860> trailer<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.000> no<00:03:47.210> trailer<00:03:47.510> is

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630

connected to the brakes and it will

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.810 
connected to the brakes and it will

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
flash red plug that back in let's say

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.840 
flash red plug that back in let's say
you<00:03:55.910> add<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> ground<00:03:56.360> connection<00:03:56.630> become<00:03:57.110> loose
