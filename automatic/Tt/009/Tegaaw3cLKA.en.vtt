00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
short but not all the way short so you

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.910 
short but not all the way short so you
can<00:02:43.780> still<00:02:44.019> see<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> clouds<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.709> stuff

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
can still see the clouds and stuff

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.410 
can still see the clouds and stuff
because<00:02:45.010> that's<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> best<00:02:45.579> part<00:02:45.910> I'm<00:02:46.150> are

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
because that's the best part I'm are

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.370 
because that's the best part I'm are
having<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.010> normal<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.160> far<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.049> like

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
having it normal and far so that I like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.710 
having it normal and far so that I like
that<00:02:50.530> one<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.400> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
that one I like that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.090 
that one I like that
that's<00:02:51.990> probably<00:02:52.290> my<00:02:52.560> favorite<00:02:52.860> part<00:02:53.040> about

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
that's probably my favorite part about

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.670 
that's probably my favorite part about
optifine<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.080> change<00:02:55.320> all<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
optifine and you can just change all the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.170 
optifine and you can just change all the
settings<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.490> doesn't<00:02:56.910> look<00:02:56.970> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
settings and it really doesn't look that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660 
settings and it really doesn't look that
different<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.840> know<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.380> quality<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:59.490> game

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
different you know the quality the game

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.840
