 Ingredients 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.649
 We're going to use three half-glass eggs. 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.440

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 measures we use in this recipe 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.060
 were based on this cup size 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
 Okay, so when you're going to do the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.580
 measures of your revenue 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 look for a cup more or less of this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 The next step is to mix the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 dry ingredients 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 we will put the sugar the yeast and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.030
 along with the affection and we will mix well 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030
 be here 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 Okay, so seeing this mix 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.860
 we're going to book a radinho and we 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.220
 Let 's prepare the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.830
 liquid ingredients 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:09.679
 Ok first we'll get the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:15.500
 orange and we're going to take this 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.240
 part here you see us there 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.240
 Let's remove this part here. 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:33.379
 done it now we 'll cut it down 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:35.329
 kind of what in my thesis and she's going to stay 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:42.230
 like this 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:46.430
 Okay and we're going to cut the goal - it's her 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.859
 always leaving the part of the man to 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.560
 that we can have more ease 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.560
 remove the seeds in the middle of it 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.920
 and our orange peel is ready 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.250
 so we'll book there too. 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.210
 now we'll use the only one of 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.500
 applicator 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.500
 Let's put the orange juice 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:34.530
 Let's also put the oranges that we 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.530
 we cut with the shell 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.190
 also the oil 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.610
 ok liquid ingredients as one 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.870
 blender 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.870
 we are going to hit there 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.440
 then ready our ingredients 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.410
 book we'll get the flour again 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.550
 the sugar and yeast that we had 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.220
 reserved 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:18.329
 We're going to open a little cage inside the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.970
 A dimple in here for here ok let's 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:29.160
 open here looking at the sides of the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:35.780
 and we'll pour the link there. 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:38.990
 inside us inside that twisted 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:43.440
 You can leave a little rest 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:49.190
 blackheads and not to not get too full and 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.190
 you end up shedding or making muddy 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.560
 after the mass is already so 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:04.039
 so we can put the rest of the 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:07.060
 our customer issued and the unit of 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.060
 mix well here 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.810
 so mixed with our mass it goes 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.880
 stay with this darkness and paste this 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.880
 look looks do not know if you go 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.120
 I can see but she has a few bits 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.220
 of orange peel to these small pieces 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.759
 here I will give a special touch with the 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.759
 our world 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.720
 now we'll put in the shape I 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:40.139
 I prefer it here because it has a hole in it. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:46.560
 I mean , she thinks better of the cake. 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:54.830
 so now we'll put the shape and 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.830
 We will use our best 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.509
 take advantage of our 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.069
 We have already put our pasta in the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:19.029
 baking sheet and now we're going to put 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:24.960
 preheated oven the time you go 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:28.419
 leave on temperature 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.599
 So you'll see if he is. 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.689
 good it will be by his appearance when 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:39.819
 he is very golden and he is also 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:42.939
 you can stick a toothpick or knife right 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.159
 If nothing comes out in the knife, nothing here. 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:49.419
 ease with even there you can already 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:51.430
 take're then going to our cake 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:57.969
 It's ready and now let's see how it 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:07:00.879
 I just wanted him to stay and 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:02.439
 delicious I will not cut it here for 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:07.289
 You'll see why I'm going to go here. 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:09.909
 take a shower but it looks beautiful it only looks 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:13.089

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:15.099

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:18.159
