00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
ease and you see in the very top we have

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
ease and you see in the very top we have
the<00:00:46.980> 1<00:00:47.219> 2<00:00:47.430> 3<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.940> way<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> 10<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:49.079> are

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the 1 2 3 all the way up to 10 these are

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.509 
the 1 2 3 all the way up to 10 these are
the<00:00:49.320> different<00:00:49.590> animations<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> link

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
the different animations you can link

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.430 
the different animations you can link
together<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.179> you<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.199> start

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
together and as you go through you start

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:02.569 
together and as you go through you start
moving<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> each<00:00:53.100> number<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.429> going

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
moving on to each number so we're going

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.040 
moving on to each number so we're going
ahead<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.059> leaking<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.570> different

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
ahead and we're leaking to different

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.260 
ahead and we're leaking to different
states<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> animation<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> posit<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
states in the animation so you posit a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
states in the animation so you posit a
state<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> decide<00:01:07.530> where<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.190> want<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
state and decide where you want that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
state and decide where you want that
animation<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.300> continue<00:01:09.750> after<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> States

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
animation to continue after that States

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.499 
animation to continue after that States
and<00:01:10.740> we're<00:01:11.369> really<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.329> moves

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
and we're really you know the moves

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.179 
and we're really you know the moves
would<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> focus<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.920> moves

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
would want to focus on or not just moves

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
would want to focus on or not just moves
that<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.759> see<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.060> everyday<00:01:15.270> wov<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.259> we

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that you see in everyday wov because we

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.480 
that you see in everyday wov because we
don't<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> fans<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
don't think that's what the fans want to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
don't think that's what the fans want to
create<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.479> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> create<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> moves<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
create they want to create the moves you

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.319 
create they want to create the moves you
never<00:01:19.290> seen<00:01:19.590> WBU<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.909> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> create<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
never seen WBU you want to create the

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.090 
never seen WBU you want to create the
moves<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.619> completely

original so we're making sure we're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
original so we're making sure we're
offering<00:01:24.810> animations<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.740> never<00:01:26.310> never

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
offering animations that never never

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
offering animations that never never
been<00:01:26.939> seen<00:01:27.270> before<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.600> moves<00:01:27.990> I've<00:01:28.170> never

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
been seen before or moves I've never

been seen before or moves I've never
been<00:01:28.470> seen<00:01:28.649> before<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.640> not

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
been seen before because there's not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
been seen before because there's not
much<00:01:29.939> fun<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.329> creative<00:01:30.630> moves<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> see
