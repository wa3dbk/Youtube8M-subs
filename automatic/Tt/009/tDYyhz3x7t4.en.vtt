entrance there and we have in the fall
we<00:00:55.390> put<00:00:55.660> in<00:00:55.870> some<00:00:56.050> producers<00:00:56.590> on<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:58.390> this

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
we put in some producers on like this

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.990 
we put in some producers on like this
this<00:00:58.960> one<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.170> right<00:00:59.500> here<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:00.730> makes

this one this right here and it makes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.509 
this one this right here and it makes
the<00:01:01.149> interest<00:01:01.510> smaller<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.070> cold<00:01:03.280> wind

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
the interest smaller so the cold wind

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.630 
the interest smaller so the cold wind
