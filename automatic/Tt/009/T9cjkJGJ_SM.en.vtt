00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
going to grab the back of this heel here

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.330 
going to grab the back of this heel here
and<00:01:50.500> I'm<00:01:50.979> going<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.250> move<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.509> cleat<00:01:52.869> on<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
and I'm going to move the cleat on the

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.889 
and I'm going to move the cleat on the
bottom<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.850> shoe<00:01:55.030> notice<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.539> didn't<00:01:55.780> move

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
bottom of the shoe notice I didn't move

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.109 
bottom of the shoe notice I didn't move
his<00:01:56.110> shoe<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.619> just<00:01:57.190> moved<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.549> cleat<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.000> now

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
his shoe I just moved the cleat and now

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.389 
his shoe I just moved the cleat and now
the<00:01:58.179> cleat<00:01:58.509> is<00:01:58.659> now<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.200> center<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.039> now<00:02:00.069> we

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
the cleat is now in the center so now we

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.789 
the cleat is now in the center so now we
know<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:00.819> that<00:02:01.240> cleat<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.630> centered<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.110> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
know that that cleat is centered on the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.899 
know that that cleat is centered on the
bottom<00:02:03.069> of<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.280> shoe<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.670> correct

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
bottom of that shoe in the correct

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.669 
bottom of that shoe in the correct
position<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.600> once<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.929> do<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.140> I'm<00:02:05.500> going<00:02:05.619> to

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
position so once I do that I'm going to

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.080 
position so once I do that I'm going to
have<00:02:06.220> him<00:02:06.369> lift<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.759> out<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.789> I'm<00:02:10.030> just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
have him lift this out and I'm just

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.120 
have him lift this out and I'm just
going<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.420> tighten<00:02:10.690> these<00:02:11.019> cleats<00:02:11.769> here<00:02:12.100> a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
going to tighten these cleats here a

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.789 
going to tighten these cleats here a
little<00:02:12.310> bit<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.690> they<00:02:14.080> don't<00:02:14.260> move<00:02:14.440> again

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
little bit so that they don't move again

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.800

but we're going to put them back into

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
but we're going to put them back into
this<00:02:17.080> machine<00:02:17.349> okay<00:02:17.890> now<00:02:18.040> pedal<00:02:18.640> again<00:02:18.849> Peter

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
this machine okay now pedal again Peter

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:41.199 
this machine okay now pedal again Peter
let's<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:19.959> going<00:02:20.200> again

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.000 

we're<00:02:42.049> going<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.290> let<00:02:42.379> him<00:02:42.470> peddle<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> little

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
we're going to let him peddle a little

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.680 
we're going to let him peddle a little
bit<00:02:43.129> more

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
bit more

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.940 
bit more
then<00:02:44.810> we're<00:02:44.960> going<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.110> have<00:02:45.290> them<00:02:45.410> stop<00:02:45.710> in<00:02:45.890> a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
then we're going to have them stop in a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.890 
then we're going to have them stop in a
minute

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
we're going to see exactly where that

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.280 
we're going to see exactly where that
alignment<00:02:50.030> tool<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.390> lined<00:02:50.659> up<00:02:50.840> for

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.080

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
alright so we just have Peter stop again

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.900 
alright so we just have Peter stop again
but<00:02:59.300> bring<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.510> over<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.720> three<00:02:59.900> o'clock<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.430> if

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
but bring it over to three o'clock so if

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.760 
but bring it over to three o'clock so if
you<00:03:05.420> notice<00:03:05.660> we're<00:03:05.810> still<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.620> middle

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
you notice we're still in the middle

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.650 
you notice we're still in the middle
Radle<00:03:07.160> almost<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> center<00:03:08.120> again<00:03:08.210> and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
Radle almost in the center again and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.090 
Radle almost in the center again and
that's<00:03:08.990> what<00:03:09.170> we<00:03:09.260> want<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:09.530> we<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.010> this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
that's what we want so we know that this

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.620 
that's what we want so we know that this
particular<00:03:10.310> pleat<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:10.970> set<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.210> correctly

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
particular pleat is set up correctly

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.470 
particular pleat is set up correctly
all<00:03:12.470> right<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:13.700> would<00:03:13.850> do<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.240> both<00:03:14.420> sides

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
all right we would do this on both sides

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.110 
all right we would do this on both sides
and<00:03:15.170> get<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.280> cleat<00:03:16.700> set<00:03:16.880> up<00:03:16.970> exactly

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
and get this the cleat set up exactly

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.600 
and get this the cleat set up exactly
the<00:03:17.570> way<00:03:17.690> they<00:03:17.810> should<00:03:17.870> be<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.220> he<00:03:19.400> should

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the way they should be and and he should

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.430 
the way they should be and and he should
give<00:03:19.820> him<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.060> better<00:03:20.180> riding<00:03:20.660> position<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
give him a better riding position and a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440 
give him a better riding position and a
better<00:03:21.620> feel<00:03:21.860> on<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.100> pedal<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.910> what<00:03:23.390> he

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
better feel on the pedal and what he

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.420 
better feel on the pedal and what he
probably<00:03:23.630> felt<00:03:24.350> before<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.510> that's<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.750> this

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
probably felt before so that's what this

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.360 
probably felt before so that's what this
cleat<00:03:28.430> master<00:03:28.850> will<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:30.040> that's<00:03:31.040> been<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
cleat master will do that's been a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.350 
cleat master will do that's been a
little<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:31.580> more<00:03:31.700> pure<00:03:32.000> let's<00:03:32.180> make<00:03:32.330> sure

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
little bit more pure let's make sure

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.390 
little bit more pure let's make sure
ledee<00:03:32.780> I'm<00:03:33.290> gonna<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.770> other<00:03:33.830> side<00:03:34.130> wall

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
ledee I'm gonna do the other side wall

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.110 
ledee I'm gonna do the other side wall
after<00:03:35.270> he's<00:03:35.420> done<00:03:35.570> with

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.080 

done<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.110> we<00:03:43.770> accomplished<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:44.880> our

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
goal was is to get the biomechanics of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.460 
goal was is to get the biomechanics of
his<00:03:49.620> foot<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.190> his<00:03:50.520> Queen<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.150> his<00:03:51.360> petal<00:03:51.840> all

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
his foot and his Queen and his petal all

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.900 
his foot and his Queen and his petal all
in<00:03:52.770> line<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.280> that's<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.610> this<00:03:53.730> particular

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
in line and that's what this particular

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.940 
in line and that's what this particular
tool<00:03:54.630> allowed<00:03:54.870> us<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.140> do<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.739> line

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
tool allowed us to do is to line

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.350 
tool allowed us to do is to line
everything<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.580> from<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.420> cleat<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:59.239> and<00:04:00.239> I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
everything up from the cleat on up and I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.910 
everything up from the cleat on up and I
think<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.810> what<00:04:01.019> will<00:04:01.200> happen<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.739> this<00:04:01.860> will

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
think that what will happen is this will

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.339 
think that what will happen is this will
whistle<00:04:02.489> actually<00:04:03.090> loud<00:04:03.269> his<00:04:03.480> knee<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.989> his

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
make a difference in what was the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.900 
make a difference in what was the
process<00:04:21.299> like<00:04:21.540> uh<00:04:22.169> yeah<00:04:23.040> no<00:04:23.250> actually<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.669> did

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
process like uh yeah no actually I did

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.760 
process like uh yeah no actually I did
notice<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.270> big<00:04:24.510> difference<00:04:24.540> what<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.169> found<00:04:25.410> was

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
notice a big difference what I found was

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.100 
notice a big difference what I found was
my<00:04:26.010> knee<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.790> actually<00:04:27.270> bending<00:04:27.600> out<00:04:27.780> more

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
my knee was actually bending out more

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600 
my knee was actually bending out more
than<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.440> should<00:04:28.470> have<00:04:28.800> been<00:04:28.950> so<00:04:29.280> when<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
than it should have been so when the

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.219 
than it should have been so when the
wouldn't<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.060> used<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.479> actual<00:04:30.810> tools<00:04:31.050> to

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
wouldn't be used the actual tools to

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.050 
wouldn't be used the actual tools to
adjust<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.800> cleat<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.280> found<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.880> my<00:04:33.000> knee

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
adjust the cleat I found that my knee

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.310 
adjust the cleat I found that my knee
was<00:04:33.270> pointing<00:04:33.600> little<00:04:33.780> bit<00:04:33.870> straighter<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.200> was

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
was pointing little bit straighter I was

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.500 
was pointing little bit straighter I was
a<00:04:34.350> lot<00:04:34.530> more<00:04:34.560> comfortable<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.430> did<00:04:36.330> I've

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
a lot more comfortable I did I've

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.879 
a lot more comfortable I did I've
noticed<00:04:37.139> that<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.290> was<00:04:37.410> keeping<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.740> lot

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
noticed that I was keeping it a lot

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.650 
noticed that I was keeping it a lot
straighter<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> find<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.060> lot<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.240> my<00:04:39.419> rides

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
straighter what I find a lot of my rides

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.340 
straighter what I find a lot of my rides
because<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.050> don't<00:04:40.320> have<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.560> lined<00:04:41.400> up<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:42.350> that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
because I don't have it lined up is that

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.680 
because I don't have it lined up is that
the<00:04:43.680> my<00:04:44.070> foot<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.550> pointing<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.180> or<00:04:45.330> pointing

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
the my foot is pointing in or pointing

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.000 
the my foot is pointing in or pointing
out<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:46.500> kind<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.860> pretty

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
out and it's kind of it's pretty

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.740 
out and it's kind of it's pretty
uncomfortable<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.240> was<00:04:48.450> actually<00:04:48.539> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
uncomfortable so it was actually a

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.950 
uncomfortable so it was actually a
really<00:04:48.870> nice<00:04:49.050> touch<00:04:49.320> very<00:04:49.680> easily<00:04:49.919> took<00:04:50.700> maybe

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
really nice touch very easily took maybe

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.500 
really nice touch very easily took maybe
10<00:04:51.960> minutes<00:04:52.200> total
