00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.720

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.259
 which you are going to do the intervention with 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.700
 he will tell you and then all the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.460

 if you go around you said the same thing 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.700
 He was saying but in other words 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.170
 at that moment he will understand that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.299
 you're talking about him it's like you 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.640

 then he will feel heard he is going 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.569
 to feel understood is not going to feel 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.429
 judged and therefore will want
