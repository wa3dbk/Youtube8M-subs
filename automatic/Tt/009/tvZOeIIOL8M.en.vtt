00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.680
I'm Kate McCartney.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.760
And I'm Kate McLennan.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.800
We're women.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
Welcome to the Katering show.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.440
KATE MCLENNAN:
Back when I first met McCartney,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.120
she didn't care about food,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.480
and we had hardly anything
to talk about.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.800
Can you just move...

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.560
Just move the chopping board
over a bit, please.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.800
But all that changed when McCartney
was diagnosed

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.600
with a terminal illness.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.360
Food intolerances.
I have food intolerances.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.880
Doctors told me
if I didn't give up these foods,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.840
I'd probably keep (BLEEP) my pants.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.040
Keep?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
(SOBBING)

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
(CHEERING)

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760
That's very good.
That's delicious.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.240
- Did we make that?
- Yes.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800
Oh, for fuck's sake!

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360
The answer is this lady.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.880
Sarah Wilson.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.600
(WHISPERS) Sarah Wilson.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.160
We're going to make a stuffing
out of rice, cranberries,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.680
oranges and some herbs,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.360
which doesn't sound
like it's going to work.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.240
Hmm, that tastes like balls.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.720
It's just a funny little joke
about food culture.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.240
Is it?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.520
Yes. It is.
