keep an eye on your reduction because

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.930 
keep an eye on your reduction because
when<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> vinegar<00:02:48.930> starts<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.370> thicker

when the vinegar starts to get thicker
it<00:02:51.180> could<00:02:51.840> build<00:02:52.140> very<00:02:52.590> easily<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
it could build very easily so here the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.260 
it could build very easily so here the
video<00:02:55.050> guys<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:56.220> reduced<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.790> about<00:02:56.880> a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
video guys have reduced to about a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.150

easier to transfer to the squeeze bottle
the<00:03:17.160> reduction<00:03:17.670> has<00:03:17.880> cooled<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:19.110> still

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
the reduction has cooled down a still

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.650 
the reduction has cooled down a still
hot<00:03:19.920> though

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
hot though

you<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.260> make<00:03:58.410> very<00:03:58.650> thin<00:03:58.740> lines<00:04:00.440> or<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:02.280> can

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
you can make very thin lines or you can

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:14.070 
you can make very thin lines or you can
do<00:04:02.760> circle<00:04:03.330> if<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.510> want
