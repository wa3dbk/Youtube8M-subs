00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

we<00:00:00.780> can<00:00:00.960> use<00:00:00.989> certain<00:00:01.500> harmonics<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.399> us

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
we can use certain harmonics to take us

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.630 
we can use certain harmonics to take us
out<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:02.850> our<00:00:03.120> typical<00:00:03.419> standard<00:00:04.049> tuning<00:00:04.259> and

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
out of our typical standard tuning and

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
out of our typical standard tuning and
give<00:00:05.640> us<00:00:05.759> something<00:00:06.120> different<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:07.020> let's<00:00:07.350> try

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
give us something different so let's try

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.220 
give us something different so let's try
just<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.040> really<00:00:08.340> simple<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.599> drop<00:00:09.960> D

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
just a really simple one this is drop D

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.560 
just a really simple one this is drop D
tuning<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:10.980> very<00:00:11.190> popular<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.969> lots<00:00:12.450> of

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
rock and roll of donors also you know

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.930 
rock and roll of donors also you know
just<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.350> general<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.250> people<00:00:17.400> if

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
just just in general for some people if

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.029 
just just in general for some people if
you<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> song<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> key<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.710> D

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
you have a song it's in the key of D

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
you have a song it's in the key of D
major<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> want<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.150> lower<00:00:21.390> d<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.900> top<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
major and you want a lower d on top of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.109 
major and you want a lower d on top of
it<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.410> don't<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> basis<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> good

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
it you don't have a basis this is a good

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.160 
it you don't have a basis this is a good
way<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> getting<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> done<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.849> play<00:00:26.849> open<00:00:27.180> D<00:00:27.390> ok

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
way of getting it done so play open D ok

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.890 
way of getting it done so play open D ok
and<00:00:29.800> then<00:00:29.950> you<00:00:30.070> play<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.430> 12th<00:00:30.880> fret<00:00:31.180> harmonic

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
and then you play the 12th fret harmonic

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.130 
and then you play the 12th fret harmonic
there<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.560> 12th<00:00:32.860> fret<00:00:32.950> harmonic<00:00:33.100> two<00:00:33.580> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
there is a 12th fret harmonic two of the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.880 
there is a 12th fret harmonic two of the
E<00:00:35.170> string<00:00:36.210> remember<00:00:37.210> barely<00:00:37.630> touching<00:00:38.110> right

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
E string remember barely touching right

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.760 
E string remember barely touching right
on<00:00:39.100> top<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.960> you<00:00:41.020> hear<00:00:41.260> those<00:00:41.440> aren't<00:00:41.680> the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
on top now you hear those aren't the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.549 
on top now you hear those aren't the
same<00:00:41.920> note<00:00:42.100> at<00:00:42.220> all<00:00:42.690> mm-hmm<00:00:43.690> well<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.320> want

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
same note at all mm-hmm well you want

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.049 
same note at all mm-hmm well you want
them<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.830> sound<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.130> same<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.699> we're<00:00:45.850> going<00:00:45.970> to

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
them to sound the same so we're going to

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.860 
them to sound the same so we're going to
play<00:00:46.270> D<00:00:46.540> in<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.680> 12th<00:00:47.949> fret<00:00:48.010> harmonic<00:00:48.250> eonni

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
play D in the 12th fret harmonic eonni

00:00:48.870 --> 00:01:06.960 
play D in the 12th fret harmonic eonni
go<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:50.050> knob<00:00:50.230> immediately

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.650 

okay<00:01:08.370> now<00:01:09.370> we<00:01:09.430> have<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.730> D<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:12.850> as<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.360> bass

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
okay now we have a D on our as a bass

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.389 
okay now we have a D on our as a bass
string

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.310 

okay<00:01:18.399> if<00:01:19.119> we<00:01:19.270> play<00:01:19.420> ad<00:01:19.540> major<00:01:19.810> chord<00:01:19.990> now

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
okay if we play ad major chord now

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.230 
okay if we play ad major chord now
remember<00:01:20.770> when<00:01:20.950> we<00:01:21.070> play<00:01:21.250> D<00:01:21.460> major<00:01:21.640> before

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
remember when we play D major before

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.670 
remember when we play D major before
we<00:01:23.810> use<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.259> D<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.740> our<00:01:24.920> base<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.759> open<00:01:26.000> deep

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
we use the D is our base to open deep

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.859 
we use the D is our base to open deep
well<00:01:27.680> now<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.909> can<00:01:28.970> have<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> low<00:01:29.540> D<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.840> a

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
well now you can have the low D is a

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.800 
well now you can have the low D is a
base<00:01:30.850> see<00:01:31.850> how<00:01:31.909> much<00:01:32.090> thicker<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:32.630> cord<00:01:32.899> is

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
base see how much thicker that cord is

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.300 
base see how much thicker that cord is
but<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:35.930> also<00:01:36.110> changes<00:01:36.619> are<00:01:36.740> other<00:01:36.979> chords

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
but this also changes are other chords

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.010 
but this also changes are other chords
so<00:01:37.549> we<00:01:37.640> can't<00:01:37.820> play<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.030> g-major<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.840> this

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
so we can't play a g-major like this

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.669 
so we can't play a g-major like this
anymore<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.850> doesn't<00:01:41.210> work<00:01:41.509> what<00:01:42.439> we<00:01:42.500> have<00:01:42.619> to

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
anymore see doesn't work what we have to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.730 
anymore see doesn't work what we have to
do<00:01:42.830> now<00:01:43.570> let's<00:01:44.570> play<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:44.960> our<00:01:44.990> third<00:01:45.500> finger

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
do now let's play with our third finger

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.529 
do now let's play with our third finger
the<00:01:46.070> fifth<00:01:46.490> fret<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:46.850> string<00:01:46.939> is<00:01:47.390> now

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
the fifth fret of the a string is now

00:01:47.539 --> 00:02:10.530 
the fifth fret of the a string is now
this<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.140> G<00:01:48.590> C<00:01:48.740> D<00:01:48.920> F<00:01:49.990> d<00:01:50.990> e<00:01:51.429> f<00:01:52.429> g

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.780 

okay<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.470> try<00:02:12.650> experimenting<00:02:12.980> with<00:02:13.280> drop<00:02:13.610> D

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
okay so try experimenting with drop D

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.850 
okay so try experimenting with drop D
tuning
