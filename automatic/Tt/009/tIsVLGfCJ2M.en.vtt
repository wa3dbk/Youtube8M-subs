00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 not made in abstract 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.010
 destinations are the basis for the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 Jam then comes sugar 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.309

 steinfurth because the quality of the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.509
 cut rose petals with the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.799
 sugar and gelling together and that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.869

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.869
 jam and then to the rose 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.180
