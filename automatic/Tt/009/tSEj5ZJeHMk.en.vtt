the<00:03:49.850> only<00:03:50.180> difference<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.989> can<00:03:51.019> see<00:03:51.410> from<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the only difference I can see from the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.000 
the only difference I can see from the
mm<00:03:52.670> standard<00:03:53.030> issue<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.590> regular<00:03:54.890> em

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
mm standard issue and the regular em

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.699 
mm standard issue and the regular em
frames<00:03:55.310> are<00:03:55.610> decide<00:03:56.420> hinges<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.440> if<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.560> look

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
frames are decide hinges so if you look

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.120 
frames are decide hinges so if you look
at<00:03:57.799> this<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.519> regular<00:03:59.260> rubbage<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.919> pretty

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
at this the regular rubbage it's pretty

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.100 
at this the regular rubbage it's pretty
set

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
set

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.470 
set
but<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.350> take<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.560> look<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.120> standard

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
but if you take a look at the standard

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.380 
but if you take a look at the standard
issue<00:04:09.180> there's<00:04:10.180> no<00:04:10.360> protection<00:04:10.840> there's<00:04:11.230> no

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
issue there's no protection there's no

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.199 
issue there's no protection there's no
it's<00:04:13.390> just<00:04:13.630> straight<00:04:14.290> out<00:04:14.410> plastic<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:16.120> have

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
it's just straight out plastic you have

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.479 
it's just straight out plastic you have
a<00:04:16.239> nice<00:04:16.450> curve<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.079> it<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.420> take<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.630> look

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
a nice curve to it if you take a look

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.300 
a nice curve to it if you take a look
the<00:04:21.489> only<00:04:21.609> difference<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:23.680> this<00:04:24.040> one

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the only difference that it's this one

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.090 
the only difference that it's this one
and<00:04:24.690> this<00:04:25.690> one<00:04:25.750> here<00:04:26.170> I<00:04:26.350> think<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:26.920> is<00:04:27.070> a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
and this one here I think this is a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.270 
and this one here I think this is a
special<00:04:28.020> lens<00:04:29.020> which<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.500> cannot<00:04:29.740> use<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
special lens which you cannot use the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.900 
special lens which you cannot use the
regular<00:04:30.430> Oakley<00:04:30.970> M<00:04:31.180> frame<00:04:31.500> for<00:04:32.910> four

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
regular Oakley M frame for four

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.790 
regular Oakley M frame for four
interchangeable<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.870> if<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.380> gotta<00:04:35.560> buy<00:04:35.770> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
interchangeable so if you gotta buy the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.860 
interchangeable so if you gotta buy the
replacement<00:04:36.430> lens<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.210> get<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.390> look<00:04:37.540> for<00:04:37.750> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
replacement lens you get a look for the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.210 
replacement lens you get a look for the
