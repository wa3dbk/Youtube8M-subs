invented by a dairy engineer and it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
invented by a dairy engineer and it
mechanically<00:01:53.610> takes<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> alcohol<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
mechanically takes the alcohol out so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690 
mechanically takes the alcohol out so
you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.560> an<00:01:55.649> alcohol<00:01:56.040> free<00:01:56.280> product

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you can get an alcohol free product

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
you can get an alcohol free product
that's<00:01:56.880> exactly<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> same<00:01:57.780> strength<00:01:58.140> which

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that's exactly the same strength which

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
that's exactly the same strength which
no<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.740> company<00:01:59.070> knows<00:01:59.369> Wow<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.030> have

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
no other company knows Wow so we have

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.080 
no other company knows Wow so we have
that<00:02:00.329> patent<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> few<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.200> years<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that patent for a few more years and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.920 
that patent for a few more years and
then<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.420> use<00:02:03.810> liquid<00:02:04.049> nitrogen<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.219> to

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
then we use liquid nitrogen in there to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930 
then we use liquid nitrogen in there to
not<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.290> above<00:02:07.590> 90<00:02:08.129> degrees<00:02:08.459> when<00:02:08.759> we're

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
not get above 90 degrees when we're

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.510 
not get above 90 degrees when we're
grinding<00:02:09.179> herbs<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:10.020> pressing<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> herbs<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
grinding herbs or pressing the herbs for

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.250 
grinding herbs or pressing the herbs for
all<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> processing<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.870> do<00:02:15.989> everything

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
all the processing and we do everything

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
all the processing and we do everything
in-house<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:17.730> unique

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
in-house and so it's a very unique

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.900 
in-house and so it's a very unique
company<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.170> way<00:02:19.440> well<00:02:20.069> yes<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.819> this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
company in that way well yes and this

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.910 
company in that way well yes and this
same<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.330> most<00:02:21.450> definitely<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.560> back<00:02:22.739> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
same time most definitely going back to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.350 
same time most definitely going back to
when<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.129> mentioned<00:02:23.459> alcohol<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.209> those

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
when you mentioned alcohol for those

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.110 
when you mentioned alcohol for those
that<00:02:24.569> don't<00:02:24.690> know<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.470> common<00:02:26.250> arts

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that don't know it's common arts

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.690 
that don't know it's common arts
actually<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.900> my<00:02:28.140> opinion<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.800> found<00:02:29.160> through

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
actually in my opinion I found through

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
actually in my opinion I found through
the<00:02:29.790> research<00:02:29.819> I've<00:02:30.269> happen<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.050> with

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
the research I've happen to do with

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.670 
the research I've happen to do with
companies<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.769> it's<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.700> very<00:02:33.660> good<00:02:33.900> idea<00:02:34.379> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
companies is it's a very good idea to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580 
companies is it's a very good idea to
use<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.760> alcohol<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:36.900> extract<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
use the alcohol to actually extract it a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.979 
use the alcohol to actually extract it a
lot<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.010> companies<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:39.269> there's<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:39.720> in

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
lot of companies there there's one in

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.750 
lot of companies there there's one in
particular<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.980> they'll<00:02:41.430> use

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
particular I can think of they'll use

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.520 
particular I can think of they'll use
the<00:02:41.910> alcohol<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.480> same<00:02:42.690> patch<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.260> follow<00:02:43.440> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
the alcohol the same patch and follow it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the alcohol the same patch and follow it
all<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.739> way<00:02:43.800> through<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.220> way<00:02:44.280> down<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
all the way through all the way down to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.160 
all the way through all the way down to
the<00:02:44.670> tincture<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> final<00:02:45.569> product<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
the tincture to the final product a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.650 
the tincture to the final product a
finished<00:02:46.890> product<00:02:47.099> so<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.489> very<00:02:47.700> strong<00:02:48.090> but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
finished product so it's very strong but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.170 
finished product so it's very strong but
use<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.470> alcohol<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.940> great

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
use the alcohol because it's a great

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
use the alcohol because it's a great
agent<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.780> pulling<00:02:52.019> out<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.610> know

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
agent of pulling out it is and you know

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.400 
agent of pulling out it is and you know
in<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> poorest<00:02:54.810> countries<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.319> world

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
in the poorest countries in the world

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.140 
in the poorest countries in the world
can<00:02:55.800> make<00:02:55.920> their<00:02:56.129> own<00:02:56.160> tinctures<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.030> know

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
can make their own tinctures you know

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.399 
can make their own tinctures you know
that's<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> beautiful<00:02:57.690> thing<00:02:57.989> about<00:02:58.019> herbs

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
that's the beautiful thing about herbs

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.740 
that's the beautiful thing about herbs
they<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.920> make<00:02:59.069> their<00:02:59.220> teachers<00:02:59.750> anywhere

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
they can make their teachers anywhere

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.600 
they can make their teachers anywhere
with<00:03:01.050> alcohol<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.830> they<00:03:01.890> last<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.430> long<00:03:02.550> time

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
with alcohol and they last a long time

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.500 
with alcohol and they last a long time
on<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.090> shelf

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
on the shelf

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.839 
on the shelf
yeah<00:03:03.720> most<00:03:04.230> companies<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.099> put<00:03:05.310> lots<00:03:05.580> of

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
yeah most companies have to put lots of

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.190 
yeah most companies have to put lots of
tons<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.269> glycerin<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.840> there

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
tons of glycerin in there

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.309 
tons of glycerin in there
and<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.890> cuts<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> shelf-life<00:03:08.909> in<00:03:09.120> half<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:10.290> we

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
and it cuts the shelf-life in half so we

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.220 
and it cuts the shelf-life in half so we
with<00:03:11.129> with<00:03:11.519> mechanically<00:03:12.120> pulling<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> out<00:03:12.659> we

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
with with mechanically pulling it out we

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.839 
with with mechanically pulling it out we
don't<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.129> our<00:03:14.280> arch<00:03:14.670> is

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
don't have to do that so our arch is

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.050 
don't have to do that so our arch is
stronger<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.840> keeps<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.319> integrity<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.060> for

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
stronger it keeps the integrity and for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.729 
stronger it keeps the integrity and for
those<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.450> don't<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.959> alcohol<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
those that don't want the alcohol and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.910 
those that don't want the alcohol and
it's<00:03:20.700> all<00:03:20.879> good<00:03:21.090> mm-hmm<00:03:21.629> all<00:03:21.840> right<00:03:22.110> well<00:03:22.739> you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
