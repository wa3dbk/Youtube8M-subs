special<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> little<00:03:02.040> bit<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.550> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
special I think I have a little bit of a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.229 
special I think I have a little bit of a
sour<00:03:03.030> taste<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.630> my<00:03:03.660> mouth<00:03:03.780> from<00:03:04.319> those<00:03:04.620> two

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
sour taste in my mouth from those two

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.759 
sour taste in my mouth from those two
ridiculous<00:03:06.239> mistakes<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.810> he<00:03:06.900> made<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.620> why

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
ridiculous mistakes that he made but why

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.100 
ridiculous mistakes that he made but why

good<00:03:14.880> crossing<00:03:15.360> I<00:03:15.510> think<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.260> Kyle<00:03:16.470> Walker

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
good crossing I think that Kyle Walker

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.500 
good crossing I think that Kyle Walker
didn't<00:03:17.010> manage<00:03:17.190> me<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> goal<00:03:17.549> but<00:03:17.730> Alba<00:03:18.329> did

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
didn't manage me a goal but Alba did

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.600 
didn't manage me a goal but Alba did
manage<00:03:18.870> me<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.260> scored<00:03:19.950> when<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> needed<00:03:20.370> him<00:03:20.549> to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
manage me to scored when I needed him to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.160 
manage me to scored when I needed him to
as<00:03:20.850> well<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.299> team<00:03:21.510> did<00:03:21.690> win<00:03:21.840> every<00:03:22.140> game

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
as well and this team did win every game

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.560 
as well and this team did win every game
i<00:03:22.350> do<00:03:22.500> believe<00:03:23.000> centre-back<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:24.420> i<00:03:24.540> said

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
i do believe centre-back so like i said

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.479 
i do believe centre-back so like i said
earlier<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.440> high<00:03:25.620> medium<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.280> both

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
earlier the high medium on both

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.160 
earlier the high medium on both
centre-backs<00:03:27.000> actually<00:03:27.420> worked<00:03:27.570> relatively

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
centre-backs actually worked relatively

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.270 
centre-backs actually worked relatively
well<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.440> i<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.040> because

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
well and i think that's just because

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.000 
well and i think that's just because
they<00:03:30.180> held<00:03:30.570> a<00:03:30.720> high<00:03:30.989> line<00:03:31.350> which<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.650> something

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
they held a high line which is something

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.800 
they held a high line which is something
that<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.910> know<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.120> you're<00:03:33.269> using<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.630> player

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
that you know if you're using a player

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
that you know if you're using a player
like<00:03:33.840> david<00:03:34.380> lewis<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.920> someone<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.459> you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
like david lewis with someone with you

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
like david lewis with someone with you
know<00:03:35.850> like<00:03:36.000> bart<00:03:36.239> saw<00:03:36.480> glee<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> low<00:03:37.230> high

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
know like bart saw glee with a low high

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.590 
know like bart saw glee with a low high
work<00:03:37.769> rate<00:03:37.799> it'll<00:03:38.519> often<00:03:38.730> leave<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.060> big<00:03:39.329> gap<00:03:39.570> in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
work rate it'll often leave a big gap in

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.120 
work rate it'll often leave a big gap in
the<00:03:39.870> defense<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:40.470> you're<00:03:40.590> using<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the defense but if you're using it a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.370 
the defense but if you're using it a
defense<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:41.760> all<00:03:41.940> four<00:03:42.420> players<00:03:42.690> have<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
defense with all four players have the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.410 
defense with all four players have the
same<00:03:43.829> exact<00:03:44.190> word<00:03:44.400> rates<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.880> know<00:03:44.970> they<00:03:45.120> tend

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
same exact word rates you know they tend

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.789 
same exact word rates you know they tend
to<00:03:45.480> be<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.810> line<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.350> actually<00:03:46.500> worked

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
to be in line and it actually worked

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.680 
to be in line and it actually worked
really<00:03:46.980> well<00:03:47.100> especially<00:03:47.489> because<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.480> know

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
really well especially because you know

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.599 
really well especially because you know
when<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.140> high<00:03:49.380> line<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.799> need<00:03:49.950> quick

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
when you have a high line you need quick

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.520 
when you have a high line you need quick
defenders<00:03:51.090> which<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.690> exactly<00:03:51.810> what<00:03:52.260> i<00:03:52.290> did

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
defenders which is exactly what i did

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.170 
defenders which is exactly what i did
have<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.890> know<00:03:52.920> Vertonghen<00:03:53.519> want<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.970> all

going<00:03:59.910> into<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.269> midfield<00:04:00.480> though<00:04:00.870> all<00:04:01.739> three

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
going into the midfield though all three

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.920 
going into the midfield though all three
midfielders<00:04:02.310> were<00:04:02.820> great<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.390> know<00:04:03.420> great<00:04:03.780> on

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930

was<00:04:06.060> definitely<00:04:06.660> my<00:04:06.780> pick<00:04:07.049> out<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> bunch

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
was definitely my pick out of the bunch

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.410 
was definitely my pick out of the bunch
you<00:04:07.920> know<00:04:08.040> four<00:04:08.310> goals<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.269> might

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
you know four goals I think you might

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.759 
you know four goals I think you might
have<00:04:09.510> actually<00:04:09.690> scored<00:04:10.140> like<00:04:10.290> three<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.620> them

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
have actually scored like three of them

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.289 
have actually scored like three of them
in<00:04:10.890> one<00:04:10.920> game<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.910> used<00:04:12.090> them<00:04:12.269> before

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
in one game but I have used them before

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.360 
in one game but I have used them before
and<00:04:12.900> he<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.650> great<00:04:13.859> player<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.280> know

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
cell was probably a little more fun to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.930 
cell was probably a little more fun to
use<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.860> because<00:04:23.070> those<00:04:23.250> four<00:04:23.460> star<00:04:23.669> skills
