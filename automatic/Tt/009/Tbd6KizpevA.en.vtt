see<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> breath<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.660> life<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.110> offense

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
see a breath of life on this offense

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.779 
see a breath of life on this offense
because<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.039> terrible<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> first

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
because it was so terrible in the first

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
because it was so terrible in the first
two<00:00:56.940> games<00:00:57.149> obviously<00:00:57.930> only<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.230> two

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
two games obviously only got the two

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.479 
two games obviously only got the two
snaps<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.039> game<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.309> since

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
snaps in the first game but since

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.560 
snaps in the first game but since
Peterson's<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> out

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Peterson's actually going to be out

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.970 
Peterson's actually going to be out
there<00:01:00.600> maybe<00:01:01.320> it'll<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:01.680> room<00:01:01.949> for

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there maybe it'll get a little room for

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
there maybe it'll get a little room for
a<00:01:02.160> guy<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.309> Greg<00:01:02.609> Jennings<00:01:02.820> who<00:01:03.000> has<00:01:03.149> only

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a guy like Greg Jennings who has only

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.729 
a guy like Greg Jennings who has only
caught<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.690> pass<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.930> two<00:01:04.229> preseason<00:01:04.559> games

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
caught one pass and two preseason games

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560 
caught one pass and two preseason games
from<00:01:05.010> Christian<00:01:05.339> Ponder<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> who<00:01:06.270> knows<00:01:06.390> what

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
from Christian Ponder and who knows what

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.789 
from Christian Ponder and who knows what
the<00:01:06.659> San<00:01:06.750> Francisco<00:01:06.840> 49ers<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> do

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the San Francisco 49ers are going to do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.960 
the San Francisco 49ers are going to do
maybe<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.159> won't<00:01:08.250> even<00:01:08.400> stack<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> box

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
maybe they won't even stack the box

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.100 
maybe they won't even stack the box
against<00:01:09.210> Peterson<00:01:09.570> knowing<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> really

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
against Peterson knowing it really

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
against Peterson knowing it really
doesn't<00:01:10.470> matter<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:10.979> does<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610

doesn't matter what he does right we
want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.000> they<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.689> me

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
three and look bad and look sloppy in

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.570 
three and look bad and look sloppy in
the<00:02:35.470> passing<00:02:35.860> game<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.040> not<00:02:36.160> good<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
the passing game is not good and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.400 
the passing game is not good and
Peterson's<00:02:37.330> okay<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.019> rest<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.290> this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
Peterson's okay but the rest of this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.309 
Peterson's okay but the rest of this
offense<00:02:38.980> looks<00:02:39.280> mediocre<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.720> average<00:02:41.110> or

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
offense looks mediocre to average or

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.630 
offense looks mediocre to average or
below<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.890> it's<00:02:42.340> going<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.549> be<00:02:42.610> very

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
below that it's going to be very

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.039 
below that it's going to be very
interesting<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.150> see<00:02:43.330> what<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> reaction<00:02:43.720> is

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
interesting to see what the reaction is

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.360 
interesting to see what the reaction is
because<00:02:44.319> then<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.739> said<00:02:44.799> no<00:02:45.069> one's<00:02:45.220> going

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
because then like I said no one's going

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.160 
because then like I said no one's going
to<00:02:45.400> play<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.640> week<00:02:45.819> four<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.420> then<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.049> open

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
to play in week four and then you open

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.559 
to play in week four and then you open
the<00:02:47.380> season<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.769> Detroit<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:48.519> if<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.209> don't<00:02:49.390> see

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the season at Detroit so if we don't see

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.360 
the season at Detroit so if we don't see
something<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.290> week<00:02:50.470> 3<00:02:50.830> of<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.069> preseason

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
something in week 3 of the preseason

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.190 
something in week 3 of the preseason
against<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> 49ers<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.660> realize<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.080> might

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
against the 49ers and I realize it might

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.839 
against the 49ers and I realize it might
not<00:02:53.349> be<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.530> lot<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:53.860> even<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.310> little<00:02:54.580> glimpse

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
not be a lot but even a little glimpse

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:55.920 
not be a lot but even a little glimpse
of<00:02:54.970> hope<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:55.660> going<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:55.900> very

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
of hope it's going to be very

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.420 
of hope it's going to be very
interesting<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.500> see<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.400> attitude

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
interesting to see what the attitude

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.910 
interesting to see what the attitude
what<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.450> mood<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.959> out<00:02:59.170> here<00:02:59.200> because

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
what the mood is like out here because

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.870 
what the mood is like out here because
at<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.250> point<00:03:00.430> you're<00:03:00.579> thinking<00:03:00.819> to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
at that point you're thinking to

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.940 
at that point you're thinking to
yourself<00:03:00.910> okay<00:03:01.510> we're<00:03:01.810> basically<00:03:02.230> done<00:03:02.739> with

into<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.390> regular<00:03:04.630> season<00:03:04.930> game<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.680> road

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
into a regular season game on the road

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.259 
into a regular season game on the road
and<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:06.190> care<00:03:06.280> who<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.610> planned<00:03:06.819> it's

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
and I don't care who your planned it's

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.000 
and I don't care who your planned it's
on<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.630> road<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:08.049> regular<00:03:08.380> season<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.860> we

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
on the road it's regular season and we

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.830 
on the road it's regular season and we
don't<00:03:09.099> know<00:03:09.250> what<00:03:09.459> we've<00:03:09.610> got<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:10.450> becomes<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
don't know what we've got that becomes a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.300 
don't know what we've got that becomes a
concern<00:03:10.959> it<00:03:11.410> really<00:03:11.590> does<00:03:11.829> because<00:03:12.130> if<00:03:12.220> they

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
concern it really does because if they

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.740 
concern it really does because if they
don't<00:03:12.459> show<00:03:12.640> anything<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.060> Game<00:03:13.180> three<00:03:13.329> you

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
don't show anything in Game three you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
don't show anything in Game three you
can<00:03:14.019> do<00:03:14.140> anything<00:03:14.350> in<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:14.920> third<00:03:15.280> game<00:03:15.519> it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
can do anything in this third game it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.009 
can do anything in this third game it
will<00:03:15.940> still<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.209> better<00:03:16.480> than<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:16.690> this

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
will still be better than what this

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.360 
will still be better than what this
offense<00:03:17.350> has<00:03:17.410> done<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.739> first<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.100> second

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
offense has done the first and second

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.039 
offense has done the first and second
game<00:03:18.519> whether<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:18.970> score<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> touchdown<00:03:19.510> just

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
game whether it's score a touchdown just

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.500 
game whether it's score a touchdown just
get<00:03:20.410> five<00:03:20.709> first<00:03:21.040> downs<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.940> half<00:03:22.180> for

crying out loud just looking surgeons do

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.000 
crying out loud just looking surgeons do
something<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.049> fans<00:03:26.290> are<00:03:26.500> you

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
anything they see that is good and they

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.140 
anything they see that is good and they
should<00:03:30.069> because<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:30.700> need<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.970> see

much<00:03:36.730> luck<00:03:37.000> thrown<00:03:37.269> around<00:03:37.389> there<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.810> NFL

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
much luck thrown around there in the NFL

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.720 
much luck thrown around there in the NFL

executing they have to do it because

pretty<00:03:47.139> good<00:03:47.200> yeah<00:03:47.560> now<00:03:47.920> granted<00:03:48.400> Buffalo<00:03:48.850> was

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
pretty good yeah now granted Buffalo was

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.000 
pretty good yeah now granted Buffalo was
without<00:03:49.329> some<00:03:49.720> key<00:03:49.989> components<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.739> kevin

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
without some key components and kevin

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.710 
without some key components and kevin
cobb<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.370> my<00:03:51.489> opinion<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.880> awful<00:03:52.209> but<00:03:52.359> that's

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
cobb in my opinion is awful but that's

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.000 
cobb in my opinion is awful but that's
not<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.989> point<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.350> point<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.859> we're

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
not the point the point is if we're

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.530 
not the point the point is if we're
going<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.250> rag<00:03:54.579> on<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.819> offense<00:03:55.209> for<00:03:55.299> its

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
going to rag on the offense for its

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.259 
going to rag on the offense for its
shoddy<00:03:55.959> play<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.829> defense<00:03:57.010> look<00:03:57.370> good<00:03:57.549> roads

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
shoddy play the defense look good roads

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.879 
shoddy play the defense look good roads
made<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.569> nice<00:03:58.840> play<00:03:59.079> on<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.410> Jamarca<00:03:59.859> Sanford

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
made a nice play on the Jamarca Sanford

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.849 
made a nice play on the Jamarca Sanford
pick<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:01.389> unit<00:04:01.900> actually<00:04:02.380> looks<00:04:02.620> pretty

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
pick that unit actually looks pretty

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.470 
pick that unit actually looks pretty
instinct<00:04:03.459> at<00:04:03.579> this<00:04:03.609> point<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.239> that's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
instinct at this point and that's

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.420 
instinct at this point and that's
incredibly<00:04:05.170> important<00:04:05.620> two<00:04:06.040> things<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.340> keep

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
incredibly important two things to keep

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.879 
incredibly important two things to keep
in<00:04:06.549> mind<00:04:06.609> weak<00:04:07.480> side<00:04:07.690> linebacker<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
in mind weak side linebacker and the

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.410 
in mind weak side linebacker and the
secondary<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.639> secondary<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.090> didn't

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
secondary and the secondary I didn't

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.849 
secondary and the secondary I didn't
think<00:04:10.510> against<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.900> bills<00:04:11.049> look<00:04:11.200> too<00:04:11.319> bad<00:04:11.440> it

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
think against the bills look too bad it

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:12.990 
think against the bills look too bad it
really<00:04:11.889> didn't<00:04:12.280> they<00:04:12.340> didn't<00:04:12.549> get<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.760> see

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
really didn't they didn't get to see

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.729 
really didn't they didn't get to see
that<00:04:13.269> much<00:04:13.450> past<00:04:13.750> defense<00:04:14.230> though<00:04:14.440> are<00:04:14.530> they

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
that much past defense though are they

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.050 
that much past defense though are they
to<00:04:14.799> get

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
to get

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.370 
to get
send<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.330> many<00:04:15.450> passes<00:04:15.840> because<00:04:15.989> Kevin

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
send that many passes because Kevin

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.599 
send that many passes because Kevin
caught<00:04:16.500> threw<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> ball<00:04:16.859> four<00:04:17.100> times<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
caught threw the ball four times in the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.310 
caught threw the ball four times in the
first<00:04:17.790> half<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> his<00:04:18.209> all<00:04:18.329> CJ<00:04:18.690> spiller<00:04:18.989> right

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
first half of his all CJ spiller right

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.509 
first half of his all CJ spiller right
so<00:04:19.500> we<00:04:19.620> got<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.829> see<00:04:19.980> at<00:04:20.070> least<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.340> run

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
so we got to see at least that run

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.009 
so we got to see at least that run
