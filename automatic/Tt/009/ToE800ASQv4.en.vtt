00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.629
 we thought we just found the superphone 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.960
 the galaxi nadal 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.909
 about his profile a little over 10 inches and we can talk to him like that 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.820
 we highlight a lot of things but above all how to talk about notes 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.109
 because it has a zenith connection 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.779
 with which you can quickly open the eye notes that the screen is 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:23.659
 capacitive 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.139
 at the resolution of 1280 corp 800 pixels 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.269
 and that will be seen 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.849
 on the track and that has a little button here 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.000
 press the quote button 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.320
 double click on the screen and the notepad opens and here in poetry you can 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.310
 hold you can draw 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.580
 and of course it also has functionalities to erase that faith 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.500
 after even saving it 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.540
 another of the features that you have the ability to capture 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.620
 of screen 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 which is not exactly the strongest point 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 we press the button 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.240
 days later to the screen 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 but the best thing is that we can also do 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.330
 for example to make his friends who claimed 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.610
 when we go to weekend with them 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 and he paid it 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 all these gross forms 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.690
 this works using the version of andres 2 points 3 points 5 and a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.940
 processor 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.140
 of balconies 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 a gigahertz 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.500
 Well, very similar to what we have already used samsung 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.440
 we have a 2 megapixel camera in front 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.100
 and from behind 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.170
 we have an 8 camera with a led flash 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 of course it has winfrey who and connection 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.680
 and as you can see, you can use it perfectly as 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.580
 give it small 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 it's even more sparkling 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.950
 the galaxy note as you can find 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.040
 the same thing you can find on any android device 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.400
 more things like SansÃ³n for example are sums 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.690
 the fans 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.290
 as you can see it is customized 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 with the touchwiz interface
