00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.249
 I'll start 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.400
 so I thought I'd change it 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.720
 family is possible, my friends 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.819

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.409
 and how are you 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.430
 It's good, but ideas in practice. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.860
 there when hit silver capital of Brazil 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.130
 from Brasilia 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.680
 it would be a lot of dude 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.410
 your brand name 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.999
 who has money always needed to be depressive in the parade 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.090
 I found the first line legal 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 perhaps the difference would be because it is undone with love 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.910
 What do we do 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 ah first of course I did because the ground entered the forest 10 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.580
 volleyball the cocal 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.330
 despite the difficulty 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.010
 after you finish 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 being thus paulo 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.700
 live in exile this year is the face 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.560
 will be 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.110
 in the accumulated of the week thereafter I give marginal to ibm 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950
 today 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.500
 she should be just how is it? 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.950
 first because 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.430
 beginning to feel brasilia 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.010
 and this identification of victims 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.620
 the smile 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.620
 has been good for the surplus of Brazil 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.220
 the oil city in a way to 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.880
 It's very cool, says it. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.990
 the inspector general 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.030
 can you watch brasÃ­lia? 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.640
 eighteen could do 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 no one comes here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 o - against the dollar since Saturday morning 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 this profile of telephony abroad 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.300
 hehehe refers not only to type 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.880
 by telephone had never seen him did not know what brand name they know well 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.509
 that nothing like this dedicated these leaves end 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.789
 and after arriving in curitiba 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.679
 a few days after nothing 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.599
 trav 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.499
 Braga September 2 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.839
 I went to Curitiba 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.209
 days returned - there are good people 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.280
 this year we should train that you are living the 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:34.629
 and she should be anticipated either because she wants to be the stoppage is going to happen 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.360
 10 in this case until the spitz park 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.319
 black nick the destak will distribute 10 pda and flat data protection kits 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.400
 of activities 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.360
 sad port I was hurt very naturally healthy return but I 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.339
 I think 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:12.619
 here you police of the capital the ideal paulo 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.679
 There the attack happened very fast. 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.869
 are delaying the vote on the pre-salt 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.459
 I identify myself here a lot 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.449
 we're doing a legal campaign there, I think 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.759
 ideb is quite negative 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.399
 an idea of 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.439
 the dennis 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:43.819
 13 o pcdob if bc cut 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.629
 no one recovering well in the capital 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.810
 The combination of different colors and sales 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.199
 But Marcelo 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.889
 but with an eye on the graduates quietly the session will be accepted backwards 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.809
 searching for the trio of today 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.889
 it is true that such 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.639
 we started a campaign 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.689
 and after the robbery 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.439
 much to wish an entrance of the mine broke 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:19.329
 stop worrying about your peers speaking in true dennis 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 now 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.020
