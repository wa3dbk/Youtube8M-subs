years ago the Australian soldiers Anzac

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.439 
years ago the Australian soldiers Anzac
troops<00:00:57.250> landed<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.339> was<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.670> an<00:00:59.210> amazing

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
troops landed it was just an amazing

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.960 
troops landed it was just an amazing
experience<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:01.070> through<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.489> cemeteries

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
experience going through the cemeteries

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.479 
experience going through the cemeteries
and<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.180> battlefields<00:01:02.629> themselves<00:01:03.140> and

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
and the battlefields themselves and

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.120 
and the battlefields themselves and
seeing<00:01:04.489> what<00:01:05.479> they<00:01:05.570> experienced<00:01:06.130> was

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
seeing what they experienced was

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.219 
seeing what they experienced was
probably<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.119> highlight<00:01:08.210> because<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:09.140> were

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
probably the highlight because you were

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.930 
probably the highlight because you were
there<00:01:09.470> instead<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.130> like<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.369> hear<00:01:10.580> about<00:01:10.670> it

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
there instead of like you hear about it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.609 
there instead of like you hear about it
and<00:01:11.090> then<00:01:11.240> actually<00:01:11.630> be<00:01:11.930> there's<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.229> greatly

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and then actually be there's a greatly

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.649 
and then actually be there's a greatly
different<00:01:12.860> experience<00:01:13.310> down<00:01:14.270> there<00:01:14.299> is<00:01:14.540> an

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
different experience down there is an

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.810 
different experience down there is an
archive<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> good<00:01:16.340> example<00:01:16.520> of

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.709 
archive so this is a good example of
just<00:01:16.909> how<00:01:17.210> steep<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.829> from<00:01:19.219> here<00:01:19.600> down<00:01:20.600> to
