I believe this still is 440c and we're
going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.600> we'll<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.320> piece

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
going to see what we'll do on this piece

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:58.509

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:06.680 

cleanest<00:00:59.519> cut<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> world

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.420 

keep<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.410> mind<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> pretty<00:01:08.160> thick

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
keep in mind this is a pretty thick

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.540 
keep in mind this is a pretty thick
piece<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> bamboo<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:12.560> think<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.680> holding<00:01:14.400> its

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
piece of bamboo I think it's holding its

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.120 
piece of bamboo I think it's holding its
own<00:01:14.670> pretty<00:01:14.940> good<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.620> might<00:01:16.620> need<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> sharpen

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
own pretty good I might need to sharpen

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.460 
own pretty good I might need to sharpen
it<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:18.030> much<00:01:18.270> where<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.050> got<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
it this is pretty much where I got it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.650 
it this is pretty much where I got it
from<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> pawn<00:01:19.950> shop<00:01:19.980> and<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> bad

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
from the pawn shop and it's not a bad

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.300 
from the pawn shop and it's not a bad
edge<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.290> could<00:01:22.440> be<00:01:22.560> better<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.250> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
edge but it could be better to see if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
edge but it could be better to see if
would<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.610> another<00:01:23.850> cut<00:01:24.120> out<00:01:24.300> of<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.430> yeah

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
would get another cut out of it yeah

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.870 
would get another cut out of it yeah
look<00:01:26.760> how<00:01:26.910> thick<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.300> bamboo<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.880> compared

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
look how thick this bamboo is compared

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.120 
look how thick this bamboo is compared
to<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.090> Boyd<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> go

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 

I<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.180> we're<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.630> get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I think that's all we're about to get

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
I think that's all we're about to get
but<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.649> built<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.070> nights<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.670> 120

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
but they built these nights over 120

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
but they built these nights over 120
bucks<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.560> sharpen<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.340> going

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
bucks and I can sharpen it so it's going

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.350 
bucks and I can sharpen it so it's going
to<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.880> better<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.939> they<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.149> they're

this<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.770> worth<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> money<00:01:59.369> let's<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.759> if<00:01:59.850> we

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
this will worth of money let's see if we

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.020 
this will worth of money let's see if we
can<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.179> a<00:02:00.210> smaller

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.880

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
it clears the sign which is probably

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.350 
it clears the sign which is probably
