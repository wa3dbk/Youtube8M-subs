00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
good for the price yeah it plays okay

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.810 
good for the price yeah it plays okay
there's<00:02:40.720> nothing<00:02:40.870> wrong<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:42.520> bridge

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
there's nothing wrong with it the bridge

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.340 
there's nothing wrong with it the bridge
is<00:02:43.120> very<00:02:43.780> nice<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.260> well<00:02:44.470> angled<00:02:45.750> yeah<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.960> I

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
is very nice and well angled yeah I I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.870 
is very nice and well angled yeah I I
like<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.130> completely<00:02:48.280> non<00:02:48.640> offensive

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
like it it's completely non offensive

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.570 
like it it's completely non offensive
and<00:02:49.450> that's<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.710> things<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.100> don't<00:02:51.160> like

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and that's that the things I don't like

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.820 
and that's that the things I don't like
about<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.120> these<00:02:52.570> are<00:02:52.840> reflected<00:02:53.440> by<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
about it these are reflected by the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.470 
about it these are reflected by the
price<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.490> might<00:02:54.670> add<00:02:54.820> before<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.120> go<00:02:55.330> any

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
price I might add before I go any

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.080 
price I might add before I go any
further<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.130> things<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.550> don't<00:02:57.610> like<00:02:57.940> about

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
further so the things I don't like about

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.600 
further so the things I don't like about
it<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.780> don't<00:02:59.230> like<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.800> tuners<00:03:00.220> because<00:03:00.490> they

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
it I don't like the tuners because they

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.990 
it I don't like the tuners because they
are<00:03:00.760> cheaper<00:03:01.240> but<00:03:01.780> then<00:03:02.020> again<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.500> like

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
are cheaper but then again it is like

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.640 
are cheaper but then again it is like
$89<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.690> can't<00:03:05.050> expect<00:03:05.350> nickel

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
$89 or so so you can't expect nickel

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.860 
$89 or so so you can't expect nickel
plated<00:03:05.980> fine<00:03:06.190> tuners<00:03:06.610> at<00:03:06.730> $89<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.690> want

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
plated fine tuners at $89 if you want

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.140 
plated fine tuners at $89 if you want
those<00:03:08.080> then<00:03:08.380> you've<00:03:08.500> got<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.710> pay<00:03:08.860> more<00:03:09.070> money

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
those then you've got to pay more money

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.720 
those then you've got to pay more money
the<00:03:10.150> tuners<00:03:10.480> are<00:03:10.600> absolutely<00:03:11.170> fine<00:03:11.730> they're

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the tuners are absolutely fine they're

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.160 
the tuners are absolutely fine they're
just<00:03:12.760> not<00:03:13.150> fantastic<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.900> there<00:03:13.990> could<00:03:14.140> be

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
just not fantastic and there could be

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.130 
just not fantastic and there could be
better<00:03:14.470> again<00:03:14.920> goes<00:03:15.460> back<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> price<00:03:16.030> um

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
better again goes back to the price um

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.010 
better again goes back to the price um
the<00:03:17.620> strings<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.490> would<00:03:19.150> recommend<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.900> you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
the strings I would recommend that you

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.840 
the strings I would recommend that you
put<00:03:20.260> another<00:03:20.470> set<00:03:20.740> of<00:03:20.830> strings<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.370> like<00:03:21.700> I've

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
put another set of strings on like I've

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.610 
put another set of strings on like I've
said<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.090> other<00:03:22.210> videos<00:03:22.330> some<00:03:23.290> people<00:03:23.530> have

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
said in other videos some people have

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.080 
said in other videos some people have
said<00:03:23.890> why<00:03:24.100> would<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.310> bother<00:03:24.430> spending<00:03:24.940> money

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
said why would you bother spending money

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.550 
said why would you bother spending money
putting<00:03:25.300> putting<00:03:25.840> another<00:03:25.990> set<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.320> strings

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
putting putting another set of strings

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
putting putting another set of strings
on<00:03:26.740> when<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:26.920> could<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.190> buy<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> better

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
on when you could just buy a better

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.280 
on when you could just buy a better
violin<00:03:28.060> but<00:03:28.480> when<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.780> buy<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.080> better

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
violin but when you buy that better

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.840 
violin but when you buy that better
violin<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.920> doesn't<00:03:30.160> necessarily<00:03:30.250> mean<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
violin that doesn't necessarily mean to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.220 
violin that doesn't necessarily mean to
say<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.239> better<00:03:31.390> than<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.720> because

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
say that it's better than this because

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.840 
say that it's better than this because
the<00:03:32.440> bed<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.680> iron<00:03:32.830> Innes<00:03:33.130> probably<00:03:33.550> still<00:03:33.730> got

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
the bed of iron Innes probably still got

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.180 
the bed of iron Innes probably still got
factory<00:03:34.300> strings<00:03:34.600> on<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:34.959> well<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:36.070> then

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
factory strings on it as well and then

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.410 
factory strings on it as well and then
you've<00:03:36.370> still<00:03:36.580> got<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> put<00:03:36.910> better<00:03:37.120> strings

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
you've still got to put better strings

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.880 
you've still got to put better strings
on<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.780> so<00:03:38.020> not<00:03:38.230> only<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.470> paying<00:03:38.770> the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
on that so not only you paying the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.410 
on that so not only you paying the
monies<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.640> extra<00:03:39.910> set<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.180> strings

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
monies but this the extra set of strings

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.120 
monies but this the extra set of strings
on<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.020> you<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.290> paint<00:03:41.560> more<00:03:41.709> money<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:42.040> the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
on but you just paint more money for the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.560 
on but you just paint more money for the
violin<00:03:42.459> which<00:03:42.640> isn't<00:03:42.880> necessarily<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.390> same

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
violin which isn't necessarily the same

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.479 
violin which isn't necessarily the same
as<00:03:43.630> burning<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.680> better<00:03:44.830> set<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.130> strings<00:03:45.310> on

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
as burning a better set of strings on

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.620 
as burning a better set of strings on
here<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.790> then<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:45.940> are<00:03:46.090> not<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.420> paying

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
here and then you are not just paying

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.690 
here and then you are not just paying
more<00:03:46.959> for<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.290> whole<00:03:47.470> thing<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.489> first

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
10 15 20 dollars max on a new set of

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.820 
10 15 20 dollars max on a new set of
strings<00:03:55.209> anything<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.260> replace<00:03:56.590> these

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
strings anything to replace these

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.910 
strings anything to replace these
factory<00:03:57.370> ones<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.060> again<00:03:58.330> if<00:03:58.540> they<00:03:59.200> put<00:03:59.530> some

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
factory ones but again if they put some

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.410 
factory ones but again if they put some
daddario<00:04:00.340> credits<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.850> these<00:04:01.030> then<00:04:01.270> it's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
daddario credits on these then it's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.510 
daddario credits on these then it's
gonna<00:04:01.570> it's<00:04:01.959> gonna<00:04:02.050> pop<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.440> price<00:04:02.620> up<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.830> 150

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
gonna it's gonna pop the price up to 150

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.979 
gonna it's gonna pop the price up to 150
dollars<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.150> then<00:04:04.420> that<00:04:04.540> defeats<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.900> object

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
dollars and then that defeats the object

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.960 
dollars and then that defeats the object
of<00:04:05.350> about<00:04:05.560> managing<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.130> have<00:04:06.310> or<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.790> make<00:04:06.940> a

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
of about managing to have or to make a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.430 
of about managing to have or to make a
violin<00:04:07.390> for<00:04:07.420> 89<00:04:08.260> dollars<00:04:08.470> or<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:10.440> that's

violin for 89 dollars or so that's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.170 
violin for 89 dollars or so that's
pretty<00:04:11.709> much<00:04:11.920> if<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:12.610> like<00:04:12.850> about<00:04:13.000> it

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180

pretty much if I don't like about it
really<00:04:13.630> I'm<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:14.080> like<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.500> look<00:04:14.709> I<00:04:14.890> think<00:04:14.950> is

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
really I'm I like the look I think is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.640 
really I'm I like the look I think is
fine<00:04:15.520> oh<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.270> it's<00:04:16.540> quite<00:04:16.810> heavy<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.410> just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
fine oh it's it's quite heavy it's just

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.780 
fine oh it's it's quite heavy it's just
a<00:04:17.739> little<00:04:17.859> bit<00:04:18.040> heavy<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.489> probably<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
a little bit heavy that's probably the

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.099 
a little bit heavy that's probably the
only<00:04:18.820> other<00:04:19.060> thing<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.299> don't<00:04:19.359> like<00:04:19.510> about<00:04:19.630> it

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
only other thing I don't like about it

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.479 
only other thing I don't like about it
so<00:04:20.410> some<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.769> other<00:04:20.830> violins<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
so some of the other violins in the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.180 
so some of the other violins in the
range<00:04:21.700> are<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.940> little<00:04:22.060> bit<00:04:22.240> lighter<00:04:22.480> than<00:04:22.690> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
range are a little bit lighter than this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.409 
range are a little bit lighter than this
it<00:04:24.190> wouldn't<00:04:24.460> stop<00:04:24.640> me<00:04:24.669> buying<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> violin

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
it wouldn't stop me buying the violin

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.090 
it wouldn't stop me buying the violin
but<00:04:25.570> it's<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.440> feel<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.980> little

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
but it's I just feel it's just a little

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.260 
but it's I just feel it's just a little
bit<00:04:27.280> have<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.550> compared<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.120> other

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
bit have you compared to the other

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.060 
bit have you compared to the other
violins<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:29.020> could<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.590> number<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.980> things

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
violins it could be a number of things

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.520 
violins it could be a number of things

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:13.819 
should have kind of stuff so to spend

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.610 
should have kind of stuff so to spend
more<00:05:13.909> money<00:05:13.969> in<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.360> first<00:05:14.599> place<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.379> it's

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
more money in the first place so it's

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.610 
more money in the first place so it's
all<00:05:15.830> reflected<00:05:16.639> in<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.939> price<00:05:17.210> but<00:05:17.930> this

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
all reflected in the price but this

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.559 
all reflected in the price but this
would<00:05:18.889> be<00:05:19.009> ideal<00:05:19.159> if<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.669> don't<00:05:20.029> have<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.300> lot

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
would be ideal if you don't have a lot

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.899 
would be ideal if you don't have a lot
of<00:05:20.599> money<00:05:20.960> I've<00:05:21.949> done<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.129> review<00:05:22.520> on<00:05:22.729> this

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
of money I've done a review on this

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.079 
of money I've done a review on this
sealian<00:05:23.330> 200<00:05:23.930> which<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.409> about<00:05:24.949> $60<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:25.939> it's

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.089 
sealian 200 which is about $60 so it's

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.860 
sealian 200 which is about $60 so it's
like<00:05:26.240> $30<00:05:26.990> less<00:05:27.199> so<00:05:27.800> this<00:05:27.979> is<00:05:28.219> worth<00:05:28.729> $30<00:05:29.659> more

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
like $30 less so this is worth $30 more

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.070 
like $30 less so this is worth $30 more
but<00:05:30.969> you<00:05:31.969> know<00:05:32.089> it<00:05:32.270> just<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.629> just<00:05:32.659> depends<00:05:33.050> how

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
but you know it just it just depends how

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.480 
but you know it just it just depends how
much<00:05:33.259> money<00:05:33.499> you've<00:05:33.650> got<00:05:33.860> there's<00:05:34.159> the<00:05:34.339> good

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
much money you've got there's the good

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.800 
much money you've got there's the good
thing<00:05:34.610> about<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.849> senior<00:05:35.240> ranges<00:05:35.599> that<00:05:35.689> they

thing about the senior ranges that they
have<00:05:36.020> lots<00:05:36.289> and<00:05:36.469> lots<00:05:36.589> of<00:05:36.650> different<00:05:36.919> violins

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 
have lots and lots of different violins

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:38.320 
have lots and lots of different violins
that<00:05:37.400> suit<00:05:37.610> lots<00:05:37.879> and<00:05:38.060> lots<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.240> different

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
that suit lots and lots of different

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.540 
that suit lots and lots of different
price<00:05:38.689> brackets<00:05:39.169> so<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:39.770> always<00:05:40.009> say<00:05:40.310> buy<00:05:40.490> the

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
price brackets so I always say buy the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.189 
price brackets so I always say buy the
most<00:05:40.819> you<00:05:40.969> can<00:05:41.120> afford<00:05:41.389> and<00:05:41.689> then<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:42.110> know

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
most you can afford and then you know

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.290 
most you can afford and then you know
you<00:05:42.409> won't<00:05:42.529> go<00:05:42.710> far<00:05:42.919> wrong<00:05:42.949> but<00:05:43.729> this<00:05:43.909> would<00:05:44.270> be

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
you won't go far wrong but this would be

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.529 
you won't go far wrong but this would be
suitable<00:05:44.900> for<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.560> complete<00:05:46.219> beginner<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.879> don't

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
suitable for a complete beginner I don't

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.089 
suitable for a complete beginner I don't
think<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:48.020> would<00:05:48.139> be<00:05:48.169> suitable<00:05:48.589> for<00:05:48.650> someone

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
think it would be suitable for someone

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.730 
think it would be suitable for someone
who<00:05:49.339> has<00:05:49.490> playing<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:49.849> violin<00:05:50.180> in<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.330> past

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
who has playing the violin in the past

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.899 
who has playing the violin in the past
doesn't<00:05:51.740> have<00:05:51.860> a<00:05:51.889> violin<00:05:52.279> wants<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.610> get<00:05:52.759> back

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
doesn't have a violin wants to get back

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.119 
doesn't have a violin wants to get back
into<00:05:53.089> it<00:05:53.270> wants<00:05:53.569> to<00:05:53.659> buy<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.839> violin<00:05:54.259> I<00:05:54.439> don't

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
into it wants to buy a violin I don't

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.619 
into it wants to buy a violin I don't
think<00:05:55.399> this<00:05:55.520> would<00:05:55.699> be<00:05:55.789> the<00:05:55.879> violin<00:05:56.210> for<00:05:56.419> you

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
think this would be the violin for you

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:57.999 
think this would be the violin for you
because<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:56.960> don't<00:05:57.319> think<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.620> would<00:05:57.740> get<00:05:57.860> on

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
because I don't think you would get on

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.829 
because I don't think you would get on
and<00:05:58.159> you<00:05:58.219> would<00:05:58.370> like<00:05:58.550> it<00:05:58.819> but<00:05:59.210> as<00:05:59.330> a<00:05:59.360> beginner

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
and you would like it but as a beginner

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.899 
and you would like it but as a beginner
violinist<00:06:00.680> with<00:06:00.860> someone<00:06:01.129> who<00:06:01.250> knows<00:06:01.460> nothing

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
violinist with someone who knows nothing

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.300 
violinist with someone who knows nothing
about<00:06:02.210> anything<00:06:02.629> then<00:06:03.379> I<00:06:03.409> think<00:06:03.800> this<00:06:03.979> finding

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
about anything then I think this finding

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.040 
about anything then I think this finding
would<00:06:04.399> be<00:06:04.490> perfect<00:06:04.939> for<00:06:05.149> you<00:06:05.300> if<00:06:05.539> you<00:06:05.930> decide

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
would be perfect for you if you decide

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.360 
would be perfect for you if you decide
after<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.589> couple<00:06:06.770> of<00:06:06.830> months<00:06:06.949> you<00:06:07.129> don't<00:06:07.250> want

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
after a couple of months you don't want

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.950 
after a couple of months you don't want
to<00:06:07.430> play<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.699> any<00:06:07.789> more<00:06:07.969> then<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.569> haven't

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
to play it any more then you haven't

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.510 
to play it any more then you haven't
wasted<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.469> huge<00:06:09.710> amount<00:06:09.979> of<00:06:10.009> money<00:06:10.219> when

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
wasted a huge amount of money when

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.339 
wasted a huge amount of money when
you're<00:06:10.669> wasted<00:06:11.029> kind<00:06:11.240> of<00:06:11.330> $89

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
you're wasted kind of $89

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.269 
you're wasted kind of $89
I<00:06:12.379> know<00:06:12.710> $89<00:06:13.460> $89<00:06:14.330> but<00:06:14.509> compared<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:14.990> buying

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279 
I know $89 $89 but compared to buying

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.219 
I know $89 $89 but compared to buying
$150<00:06:16.279> or<00:06:16.430> $200<00:06:17.060> violin<00:06:17.449> you're<00:06:17.899> gonna<00:06:17.990> feel<00:06:18.199> a

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
$150 or $200 violin you're gonna feel a

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.459 
$150 or $200 violin you're gonna feel a
lot<00:06:18.409> less<00:06:18.589> guilty<00:06:18.979> about<00:06:19.039> on<00:06:19.370> you<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:20.449> yeah<00:06:21.259> I

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
lot less guilty about on you so yeah I

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:23.050 
lot less guilty about on you so yeah I
don't<00:06:21.620> think<00:06:21.889> it's<00:06:22.129> suitable<00:06:22.339> for<00:06:22.550> anybody

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
don't think it's suitable for anybody

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.290 
don't think it's suitable for anybody
other<00:06:23.300> than<00:06:23.629> probably<00:06:24.500> a<00:06:24.529> total<00:06:24.800> beginner

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
other than probably a total beginner

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.329 
other than probably a total beginner
just<00:06:26.649> because<00:06:27.649> I<00:06:27.680> don't<00:06:28.009> think<00:06:28.250> you'll

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:28.339 
just because I don't think you'll

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:29.829 
just because I don't think you'll
probably<00:06:28.399> like<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:28.879> there<00:06:29.029> are<00:06:29.149> other<00:06:29.360> violins

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
probably like it there are other violins

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.450 
probably like it there are other violins
in<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.080> range<00:06:30.289> like<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.830> could<00:06:31.159> personally

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
in the range like I could personally

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.550 
in the range like I could personally
recommend<00:06:32.240> for<00:06:32.479> you<00:06:32.659> but<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.110> think<00:06:33.379> will<00:06:33.469> be

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
recommend for you but I think will be

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.040 
recommend for you but I think will be
better<00:06:33.710> for<00:06:34.189> you

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
better for you

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.619 
better for you
so<00:06:36.050> yeah<00:06:36.800> I<00:06:37.039> mean<00:06:37.370> in<00:06:37.490> terms<00:06:37.669> of<00:06:37.969> me<00:06:38.330> personally

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
so yeah I mean in terms of me personally

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.929 
so yeah I mean in terms of me personally
liking<00:06:39.379> the<00:06:39.469> violin<00:06:39.860> it's<00:06:40.219> difficult<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.759> say

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:40.939 
liking the violin it's difficult to say

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:43.149 
liking the violin it's difficult to say
because<00:06:41.089> it<00:06:41.360> is<00:06:41.479> an<00:06:41.599> $89<00:06:42.259> violin<00:06:42.709> and<00:06:42.830> I'm<00:06:42.919> used

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
because it is an $89 violin and I'm used

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.850 
because it is an $89 violin and I'm used
to<00:06:43.219> playing<00:06:43.370> on<00:06:43.639> something<00:06:44.000> that's<00:06:44.149> worth

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
to playing on something that's worth

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.730 
to playing on something that's worth
quite<00:06:45.860> a<00:06:45.919> bit<00:06:46.069> more<00:06:46.430> but<00:06:47.269> for<00:06:47.899> beginners<00:06:48.139> then

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
quite a bit more but for beginners then

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.320 
quite a bit more but for beginners then
I<00:06:48.769> think<00:06:49.159> it's<00:06:49.250> absolutely<00:06:49.580> perfect<00:06:49.759> would<00:06:50.240> I

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
I think it's absolutely perfect would I

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.689 
I think it's absolutely perfect would I
recommend<00:06:50.690> it<00:06:50.930> to<00:06:50.959> a<00:06:51.050> beginner<00:06:51.379> yes<00:06:52.009> I<00:06:52.190> would<00:06:52.459> I

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
recommend it to a beginner yes I would I

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.850 
recommend it to a beginner yes I would I
would<00:06:53.569> recommend<00:06:53.959> it<00:06:54.019> to<00:06:54.050> one<00:06:54.199> of<00:06:54.319> my<00:06:54.379> students

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
would recommend it to one of my students

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.350 
would recommend it to one of my students
I<00:06:55.069> think<00:06:55.099> for<00:06:55.430> the<00:06:55.490> money<00:06:55.669> for<00:06:55.759> the<00:06:55.940> price<00:06:56.149> it's

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
I think for the money for the price it's

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.389 
I think for the money for the price it's
absolutely<00:06:56.839> fine<00:06:57.080> I<00:06:57.440> think<00:06:57.769> if<00:06:58.099> you<00:06:58.279> were

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:58.399 
absolutely fine I think if you were

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.610 
absolutely fine I think if you were
going<00:06:58.580> on<00:06:58.789> doing<00:06:59.089> great<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.690> doing<00:06:59.870> exams<00:07:00.319> on

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
going on doing great and doing exams on

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.249 
going on doing great and doing exams on
the<00:07:00.889> violin<00:07:01.279> then<00:07:01.699> then<00:07:02.300> this<00:07:02.419> would<00:07:03.019> be<00:07:03.139> okay

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
the violin then then this would be okay

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.529 
the violin then then this would be okay
for<00:07:03.769> you<00:07:03.860> for<00:07:04.129> the<00:07:04.190> first<00:07:04.399> year<00:07:04.729> or<00:07:04.909> so<00:07:05.120> and

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
for you for the first year or so and

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:06.879 
for you for the first year or so and
then<00:07:05.870> you<00:07:06.019> might<00:07:06.169> want<00:07:06.379> to<00:07:06.409> upgrade<00:07:06.560> to

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 
then you might want to upgrade to
