are our current faction amplifier and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.889 
are our current faction amplifier and
this<00:00:42.870> am<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.410> use<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> 3ds<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.129> other<00:00:44.430> tubes

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
this am can use the 3ds and other tubes

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
this am can use the 3ds and other tubes
trains<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.129> two<00:00:47.129> eight<00:00:47.280> three<00:00:47.309> four<00:00:47.879> five

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
trains at the two eight three four five

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.209 
trains at the two eight three four five
and<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.079> change<00:00:49.440> these<00:00:49.649> tubes<00:00:50.010> like

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and you can change these tubes like

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
and you can change these tubes like
changing<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.660> patoot

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
changing this a patoot

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
changing this a patoot
these<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:53.910> bitching<00:00:54.210> keys<00:00:54.420> we've<00:00:54.989> done<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
these two bitching keys we've done you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.350 
these two bitching keys we've done you
can<00:00:55.350> change<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> tubes<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
can change the tubes so we have one that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
can change the tubes so we have one that
then<00:00:57.510> used<00:00:57.719> three<00:00:58.079> different<00:00:58.109> power<00:00:58.469> tubes

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
then used three different power tubes

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
then used three different power tubes
that's<00:00:59.219> very<00:00:59.579> clever<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that's very clever and then it has a you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.240 
that's very clever and then it has a you
depends<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.100> fine<00:01:02.399> control<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> very

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
depends on our fine control it's very

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.850 
depends on our fine control it's very
very<00:01:05.549> clever

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
very clever

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
very clever
