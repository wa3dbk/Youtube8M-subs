price<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.820> doubt<00:02:00.509> anybody<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.290> needs<00:02:01.619> eight

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
price I doubt anybody really needs eight

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.560

supports<00:02:04.680> HDMI<00:02:05.130> these<00:02:05.460> days<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.210> nice<00:02:06.420> to
