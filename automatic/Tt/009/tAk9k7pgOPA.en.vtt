00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
first I think today there are very few

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.190 
first I think today there are very few
devices<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:27.430> nokia<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.420> doesn't<00:02:28.810> look<00:02:29.020> at

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
devices in nokia it doesn't look at

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.030 
devices in nokia it doesn't look at
levis<00:02:29.470> Samsung<00:02:29.920> device<00:02:31.440> many<00:02:32.440> handset<00:02:32.739> makers

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
levis Samsung device many handset makers

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
and then use it in the reality so there

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.340 
and then use it in the reality so there
is<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.440> obvious<00:03:20.440> link<00:03:20.650> i<00:03:20.799> would<00:03:20.980> say<00:03:21.160> between

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
is a obvious link i would say between

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.130 
is a obvious link i would say between
the<00:03:23.350> phone<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:24.090> most<00:03:25.090> common<00:03:25.540> access<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the phone and the most common access to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.599 
the phone and the most common access to
the<00:03:26.230> network<00:03:26.380> as<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:26.890> have<00:03:27.010> today<00:03:27.190> which<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.459> a

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
the network as we have today which is a

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.740 
the network as we have today which is a
notebook<00:03:28.170> pc<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.120> anything<00:03:31.120> let<00:03:31.390> us<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.600> do

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
notebook pc so anything let us to do

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.390 
notebook pc so anything let us to do
with<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.290> has<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> connection<00:03:32.709> with<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
with that has a connection with the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.289 
with that has a connection with the
network<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:35.079> be<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> NFC<00:03:35.890> enabled<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.549> and

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
network can can be a NFC enabled so and

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.210 
network can can be a NFC enabled so and
if<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.540> carry<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> with<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.109> like<00:03:38.680> netbook

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
if you carry it with you like netbook

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.710 
if you carry it with you like netbook
it's<00:03:39.370> even<00:03:39.579> better<00:03:39.730> so<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.090> have<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.390> double

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
it's even better so you have the double

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.160 
it's even better so you have the double
the<00:03:40.989> double<00:03:41.109> usage<00:03:42.480> yep<00:03:43.480> today<00:03:43.720> people<00:03:43.989> are

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
the double usage yep today people are

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.140 
the double usage yep today people are
carrying<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.620> net<00:03:44.799> postal<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.430> take<00:03:45.609> the

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
carrying the net postal to take the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.940 
carrying the net postal to take the
metro<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.989> just<00:03:47.019> type<00:03:47.620> your<00:03:47.650> netbook

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
metro so you can just type your netbook

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.000 
metro so you can just type your netbook
and<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:49.540> don't<00:03:49.720> have<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.620> even<00:03:50.829> keep<00:03:50.950> it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
and you don't have you can even keep it

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.370 
and you don't have you can even keep it
in<00:03:51.190> your<00:03:51.220> back<00:03:51.430> I'm<00:03:51.640> inside<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.420> can<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.170> use

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
in your back I'm inside you can just use

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.540 
in your back I'm inside you can just use
it<00:03:54.370> as<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.519> as<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.540> count

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.950 

so<00:04:02.550> what<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:02.850> do<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.240> have<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:03.420> software<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
so what we do we have a software on the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.400 
so what we do we have a software on the
phone<00:04:04.220> which<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.840> platform<00:04:06.840> to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
phone which is actually a platform to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.160 
phone which is actually a platform to
distribute<00:04:08.130> energy<00:04:08.250> services<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.990> this

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
distribute energy services so this

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.390 
distribute energy services so this
platform<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.780> widget<00:04:12.780> base<00:04:13.080> so<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
platform is a widget base so the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.250 
platform is a widget base so the
software<00:04:14.790> itself<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.270> runtime<00:04:15.720> environment

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
software itself is a runtime environment

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.620 
software itself is a runtime environment
and<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:17.130> icons<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.790> see<00:04:17.940> spinning<00:04:18.299> here

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
and the icons that you see spinning here

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.720 
and the icons that you see spinning here
are<00:04:18.840> which<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:19.980> this<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.549> for

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
are which is for this this is for

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.040 
are which is for this this is for
instance<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.090> coupon<00:04:21.450> which<00:04:22.410> is<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.650> widget<00:04:22.880> so

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
instance a coupon which is a widget so

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.690

it just disappears from the main menu
very<00:04:47.280> cool<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.820> mean<00:04:48.030> now<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.900> things

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
very cool I mean now one of the things

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.750 
very cool I mean now one of the things
that<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.890> like<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.100> most<00:04:50.370> about<00:04:50.520> the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
that I but I like the most about the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.390 
that I but I like the most about the
idea<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.450> NFC<00:04:51.960> was<00:04:52.230> when<00:04:52.860> i<00:04:52.890> was<00:04:53.040> leaving<00:04:53.310> the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
idea of NFC was when i was leaving the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.460 
idea of NFC was when i was leaving the
bar<00:04:53.580> at<00:04:53.610> night<00:04:53.910> i<00:04:53.940> could<00:04:54.300> just<00:04:54.540> hit<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:54.870> hit<00:04:55.440> a

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
bar at night i could just hit it hit a

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.920 
bar at night i could just hit it hit a
taxi<00:04:55.950> poster<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.520> then<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:57.150> would<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.510> of<00:04:57.570> go

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
taxi poster and then it would kind of go

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.840 
taxi poster and then it would kind of go
taxi<00:04:58.440> number<00:04:58.560> automatically<00:04:59.160> when<00:04:59.460> you're<00:04:59.610> in

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
taxi number automatically when you're in

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.550 
taxi number automatically when you're in
different<00:05:00.240> cities<00:05:00.450> it's<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:01.200> difficult

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
different cities it's really difficult

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.830 
different cities it's really difficult
to<00:05:01.860> go<00:05:01.980> cavs<00:05:02.310> at<00:05:02.520> night<00:05:02.669> sometimes<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.540> should

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
to go cavs at night sometimes you should

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.750 
to go cavs at night sometimes you should
sell<00:05:04.140> company<00:05:04.590> robots<00:05:04.919> because<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.370> doesn't

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
sell company robots because it doesn't

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.860 
sell company robots because it doesn't
exist<00:05:05.880> yet

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.230 

so<00:05:09.870> how<00:05:10.140> how<00:05:10.650> does<00:05:10.710> NFC<00:05:11.220> look<00:05:11.490> in<00:05:11.610> France<00:05:11.910> where

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
so how how does NFC look in France where

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.170 
so how how does NFC look in France where
where<00:05:13.230> is<00:05:13.260> friends<00:05:13.790> sitting<00:05:14.790> right<00:05:14.940> now<00:05:15.030> with

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
where is friends sitting right now with

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.220 
where is friends sitting right now with
us<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:16.130> Frances<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.940> very<00:05:18.300> advanced<00:05:18.900> in<00:05:19.080> terms

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
us so Frances is very advanced in terms

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.960 
us so Frances is very advanced in terms
of<00:05:19.380> technology<00:05:19.920> so<00:05:20.340> all<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.700> big<00:05:20.850> companies

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
of technology so all the big companies

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.690 
of technology so all the big companies
moving<00:05:21.870> NFC<00:05:22.440> forward<00:05:22.860> in<00:05:23.370> terms<00:05:23.520> of

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
moving NFC forward in terms of

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.240 
moving NFC forward in terms of
Technology<00:05:24.240> are<00:05:24.740> smarter<00:05:25.740> companies<00:05:26.100> like

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
Technology are smarter companies like

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.880 
Technology are smarter companies like
Gemalto<00:05:26.820> overture<00:05:27.390> which<00:05:28.140> has<00:05:28.380> number<00:05:28.680> one

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
Gemalto overture which has number one

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.680 
Gemalto overture which has number one
and<00:05:29.070> number<00:05:29.100> two<00:05:29.430> spot<00:05:29.880> car<00:05:30.180> makers<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.600> the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
and number two spot car makers in the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.050 
and number two spot car makers in the
world<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:31.080> they<00:05:31.590> are<00:05:31.650> based<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:31.920> France<00:05:32.130> so

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
world and they are based in France so

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.910 
world and they are based in France so
there<00:05:33.270> is<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.420> whole<00:05:33.930> ecosystem<00:05:34.050> around<00:05:34.650> and

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
there is a whole ecosystem around and

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.100 
there is a whole ecosystem around and
you<00:05:34.980> see<00:05:35.100> in<00:05:35.160> France<00:05:35.400> everyone<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.570> pushing

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
you see in France everyone is pushing

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.890 
you see in France everyone is pushing
the<00:05:37.290> technology<00:05:37.710> but<00:05:38.370> the<00:05:39.270> market<00:05:39.450> is<00:05:39.630> not<00:05:39.780> in

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
the technology but the market is not in

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.620 
the technology but the market is not in
France<00:05:40.110> so<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:41.850> market<00:05:42.120> is<00:05:42.180> probably<00:05:42.510> in

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
France so the market is probably in

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.810 
France so the market is probably in
Taiwan<00:05:43.050> or<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.680> Malaysia<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.790> Singapore

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
Taiwan or in Malaysia and Singapore

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.090 
Taiwan or in Malaysia and Singapore
first<00:05:45.560> where<00:05:46.560> we<00:05:46.740> see<00:05:46.890> that<00:05:47.010> the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
first where we see that the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.650 
first where we see that the
infrastructure<00:05:47.520> is<00:05:47.730> there<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.180> everything

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
infrastructure is there and everything

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.200 
infrastructure is there and everything
is<00:05:48.900> ready<00:05:49.550> technological<00:05:50.550> from<00:05:50.730> Europe<00:05:50.940> but

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
is ready technological from Europe but

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.030 
is ready technological from Europe but
