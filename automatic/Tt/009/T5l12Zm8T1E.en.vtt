00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.919
 hello everyone welcome to a new one 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.429
 episode of and sandra and knows nothing more 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.439
 simple 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.539
 today we will show you how to solve 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.429
 any problems or failures at the moment 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.199
 of your sunrise installation 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.720
 tv box for education 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.119
 complete installation beware 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.490
 the episode about it 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.160
 also make sure that the modem that 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.559
 you have received together with the tv box in the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000
 package is one functions properly 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.090
 otherwise look at this 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.090
 video strength 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.059
 as you can see we have already wired everything 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.769
 we connected to the tv box at 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.780
 current modem to TV 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.760
 however the tv box does not work and the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.010
 start button on the front top 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.890
 it doesn't light up what we can do a lot 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.050
 simple let's check first if the cable 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.630
 of the current and the power supply are 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.090
 inserted properly used is a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.710
 multiple plug multi- plug insert the TV 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 boc directly into the socket at 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.030
 current if it still does not work try 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.030
 with another outlet 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.000
 if now the TV box works there is perhaps a 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.420
 problem with the socket or switch 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.130
 security could be out 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.610
 next topic we have current 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.259
 but no image now the cable appeared 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.110
 militia happens correctly inserted 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.569
 on tv fox and on TV if not there 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 help find another Academic entrance 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:48.289
 of the TV the other could be 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.509
 therefore check if you have 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.340
 selected the correct image channel 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.770
 in your TV for most 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.399
 part of the TV sets with the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.590
 av source button or an arrow if still 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.080
 does not work or if you have the image 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.470
 blocked or hoisted pixel check the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.360
 connection with the modem the signal will be 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.160
 stronger if you have the TV box in the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.319
 same room as the modem and you have it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.720
 connected directly with the LAN cable 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.819
 if this solution is not possible a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.739
 your home you can use a 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.420
 powerline connection kit to create a 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.760
 connection to the socket 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.829
 then check which the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 cable the anxiety correctly inserted on 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.560
 both sides 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 in this case on both 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.030
 appliances the lights are eliminated or the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 at least it flashes in the opposite house 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.160
 disconnect both for a short time 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.840
 powerline henry adapters insert them in 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.079
 last you can try an old trick 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.519
 of computer a reboot remove the 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.420
 power cord 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.280
 wait 10 seconds insert it again 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.030
 then wait a couple more minutes 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.970
 until the TV box starts up again 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.560
 you are patient, that 's all 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.370
 sunrise episode nothing more 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.280
 simple 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.049

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.329
