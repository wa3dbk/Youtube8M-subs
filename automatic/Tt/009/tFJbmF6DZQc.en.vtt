and this is pretty much 98% lake proof

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.940 
and this is pretty much 98% lake proof
it<00:02:09.929> doesn't<00:02:10.289> even<00:02:10.380> claim<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.740> be<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
it doesn't even claim to be but it is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760

you<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:13.980> pop<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.370> off<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.720> got<00:02:15.990> very

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
you just pop that off and it's got very

you just pop that off and it's got very
easy<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.910> put<00:02:18.060> together

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
easy to put together

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.610 
easy to put together
straw<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.700> two<00:02:21.000> pieces<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.200> red<00:02:22.380> piece

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
straw and it's two pieces the red piece

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.190 
straw and it's two pieces the red piece
has<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.190> ring<00:02:23.400> around<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
has a little ring around it which I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.640 
has a little ring around it which I
guess<00:02:25.410> acts<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> suction<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> lid<00:02:27.810> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
guess acts as a suction for the lid so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.270 
guess acts as a suction for the lid so
that's<00:02:28.950> what<00:02:29.310> makes<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.930> virtually<00:02:30.930> spill<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that's what makes it virtually spill and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.820 
that's what makes it virtually spill and
leak<00:02:32.490> proof<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.840> love<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.440> easy<00:02:34.709> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
leak proof and I love that it's easy to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.130 
leak proof and I love that it's easy to
put<00:02:34.980> together<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.450> glad<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.780> I

walnut so this is practically new I did
want<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.650> try<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:03.919> because<00:06:04.010> I've<00:06:04.280> heard<00:06:04.610> really

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
want to try it because I've heard really

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.630 
want to try it because I've heard really
good<00:06:05.120> things<00:06:05.180> about<00:06:05.570> it<00:06:06.080> from<00:06:07.070> another<00:06:07.370> mom

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
good things about it from another mom

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.249 
good things about it from another mom
and

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
and

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.390 
and
again<00:06:10.009> had<00:06:10.400> I<00:06:10.430> used<00:06:10.729> it<00:06:11.110> during<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.710> three<00:06:13.009> six

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
again had I used it during the three six

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.820 
again had I used it during the three six
month<00:06:13.699> stage<00:06:14.569> I<00:06:14.749> think<00:06:14.840> it<00:06:15.110> probably<00:06:15.289> would

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
month stage I think it probably would

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.129 
month stage I think it probably would
have<00:06:15.860> worked<00:06:16.249> and<00:06:16.789> I<00:06:17.240> did<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.599> test<00:06:17.840> where<00:06:18.110> I

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
have worked and I did the test where I

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.409 
have worked and I did the test where I
had<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.949> milk<00:06:19.129> in<00:06:19.279> it<00:06:19.370> shook<00:06:19.819> it<00:06:19.969> up<00:06:20.029> and<00:06:20.240> down

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
had the milk in it shook it up and down

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.989 
had the milk in it shook it up and down
and<00:06:20.719> is<00:06:20.960> leaking<00:06:21.169> so<00:06:21.379> proof<00:06:21.860> it's<00:06:22.520> got<00:06:22.669> some

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:22.999 
and is leaking so proof it's got some

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.420 
and is leaking so proof it's got some
sort<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.330> magic<00:06:23.749> in<00:06:23.900> there<00:06:24.050> so<00:06:24.349> this<00:06:25.159> would

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
sort of magic in there so this would

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.459 
sort of magic in there so this would
have<00:06:25.460> worked<00:06:25.580> just<00:06:26.479> to<00:06:26.719> let<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:26.990> know<00:06:27.020> that's

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
have worked just to let you know that's

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:28.779 
have worked just to let you know that's
what<00:06:27.650> that<00:06:27.800> looks<00:06:28.009> like<00:06:28.099> if<00:06:28.460> you<00:06:28.490> start

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
what that looks like if you start

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.719 
what that looks like if you start
younger<00:06:29.259> what<00:06:30.259> actually<00:06:30.800> did<00:06:31.039> work<00:06:31.310> and<00:06:31.639> I
