00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi then today i would like to be seen 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 all the things that have been to me 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.480
 kindly sent by the site offers 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.599
 cosmetics which is an American site that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 sells professional products let's say 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.039
 I believe they are that if a brand of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.550
 those that are used inside 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.430
 of the make-up schools I have the most 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 so it happens anyway, let's see immediately what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.529
 they sent me the first thing that is me 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.320
 have been sent I say foundation 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.540
 gods why the three have sent you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 although I had only asked for one 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 which is the shade 04 which is perfect for 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.980
 my skin and that's what it has 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.500
 used also today to put makeup on 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
 shade 04 is the perfect one for me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 then the 3 and the 10 that are are postponed 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.500
 instead darker then I think of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 use them when I have to touch short 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 other people in the end is always convenient 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 also because as a foundation I feel 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 really like the one used twice 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.140
 so far but I am very pleased there is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.799
 written oil free on the back and front 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.189
 absolute cover silk petit foundation 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.320
 in short, it seems to me like a first impression 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 very good as a foundation then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 obviously I'll let you know if I like it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 so much here to tell you absolutely 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.180
 buy it I'll let you know or later chosen 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.450
 two things I needed, let's say 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.860
 the first is a primer for the eyes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.409
 second instead to a product that does not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.380
 I had never ever tried it and if I did 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 you know a minimum you know that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.159
 black gel eyeliner then this one 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 the primer for eyes as you see yes 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140
 presents in this tool bettino is a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.950
 gel primer we say inside there 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.210
 are 14 ml while we have ours here 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.979
 black eyeliner 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.579
 inside there are five grams of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.409
 product and looks like this I already have it 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.829
 used twice I like it 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 very much so absolutely 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.250
 I will continue to use it for me too 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.290
 also because for me it is really one 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.599
 therefore the type of new product is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 very enthusiastic I absolutely want 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.910
 continue to find it let's move on to a 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.700
 primer this here is a premiere for the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.489
 face and is called absolute cover face 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.610
 first of all, here I have experienced it only 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.799
 so today I can't tell you absolutely 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.700
 nothing about this primer the only one 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:40.970
 what it is that is white that is, it seems to be right 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.970
 a cream 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.900
 then we pass to two powders the first is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.810
 one transparent powder and the other instead 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.569
 It is like saying flash powder 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.209
 divided into various colors you can 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.069
 already used twice I can't tell you 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.350
 still nothing specific 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.910
 however it does not seem to me evil while the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.190
 I don't have illuminating dust yet 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.780
 tried so I can't really tell you 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.889
 nothing 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.500
 and the content of both powders 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.500
 is 10 grams I wanted to revise 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.889
 up close this illuminating powder that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.870
 really very very beautiful and by the way 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:30.590
 below has his mirror and also 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.000
 also the powder in the mirror below 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.329
 this is an effort of all colors 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.870
 put together as you see a rosin 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.150
 fished I don't know anyway of course 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.010
 you can see a lot in pink 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.500
 let's move on to the last two products 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.189
 the first thing I show you is one 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.739
 giara is an illuminating free powder 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.349
 I was wrong because when I chose 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.680
 this product I believed 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.890
 maybe a white powder from 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.110
 use long ie around the eyes 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.360
 and loyalty this is just a 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.180
 enlightening and I'll show you soon 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.480
 also swatch while the other thing is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.329
 a palette this palette is called 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.669
 simply eyeshadow palette I would say 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.070
 let's say they are very basic colors not 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.490
 there is nothing that attracts excessively 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 attention if this is not this 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.590
 here they are very metallic and therefore 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.100
 maybe the eye falls on those two 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.300
 But colors for the rest of the colors are 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.250
 very normal that surely go 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.430
 great every day to do a 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.020
 Simple and delicate make-up are perfect 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.570
 among other things they are very very pigmented 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.669
 I can assure you this now 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.860
 I also do some swatches 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.599
 here we are then these are two here 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.639
 opaque eyeshadows 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.460
 they are very very velvety to the touch 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.620
 so these 42 swatches while this 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.639
 here is one of the metallic eyeshadows 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.030
 that I told you before 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:04.490
 and this is illuminating I swear it is 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:08.550
 very very visible it is not glittered but 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.610
 lots of pink reflections is a lot 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.560
 particular let's say with regards to 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.840
 the service remained very much 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.190
 satisfied because the girl I was with 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.310
 I was contacted warned me 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.289
 he told me he probably looks the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.500
 parcel will be stopped at customs and you will have to 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.560
 pay a little to block it anyway 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.389
 we kind declare a value 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.960
 lower so that it does not come 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.970
 affirmed in customs you still do it yourself 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.569
 I say preventively that probably 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.809
 I should 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.339
 anyway I accepted because having 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.279
 sent so many products 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:46.319
 free from america i said if 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.819
 I also have to pay 20 euros to clear customs 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.819
 the package is no problem 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.309
 in any case I could follow everything 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.679
 the path of my package through the 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:58.860
 link my data to be entered in 

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:00.800
 I suppose the American post office site 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.300
 anyway shipping service 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.069
 American 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.379
 I also saw when my package is 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.509
 arrived at the customs office in Milan and I 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.800
 since later after some 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.680
 working day they have me 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.589
 unlocked the same day the same 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.379
 afternoon that of the day in which 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.339
 the courier sda me was unblocked 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.649
 took him home 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.749
 so I thought there would come 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.990
 then this with the Italian post office 

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:29.849
 pack and I expected it kind of for March was 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.469
 from the same day they finished 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.289
 customs processing have it for me 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:37.519
 so I brought with the courier 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.839
 was really happy to try 

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.519
 these products also because they seem to me 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.830
 really valid for now there is none 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.949
 not one that does not inspire me among 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.509
 the other I found almost all 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.699
 so nothing that tell you young infoboxes 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.309
