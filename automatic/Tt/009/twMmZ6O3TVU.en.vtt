teleport look at all this wasted time
you're<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.910> font<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.630> full<00:00:18.930> HP<00:00:19.199> then

you're in that font in your full HP then
using<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.250> teleport<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> an

using your teleport this is an

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.420 
using your teleport this is an
ineffective<00:00:22.109> way<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.470> getting<00:00:22.830> back<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.250> Liam

ineffective way of getting back to Liam
using<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.880> spell<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.080> after<00:00:25.410> seeing<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
using this spell I'm just after seeing a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.500 
using this spell I'm just after seeing a
diamond<00:00:26.250> player<00:00:26.460> doing<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> which<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
diamond player doing this which is the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.470 
diamond player doing this which is the
main<00:00:27.630> motivation<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.619> making<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.130> video

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
main motivation for me making this video

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.179 
main motivation for me making this video
regardless<00:00:30.480> let's<00:00:30.660> move<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.289> here's<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
regardless let's move on now here's a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.500 
regardless let's move on now here's a
more<00:00:32.399> effective<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> getting<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:33.300> at

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
more effective way of getting back at

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.299 
more effective way of getting back at
your<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.050> teleport<00:00:34.649> channel<00:00:35.100> time

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
your in your teleport channel time

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
your in your teleport channel time
you're<00:00:35.790> still<00:00:36.120> regenerating<00:00:36.540> PHP<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.440> mana

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you're still regenerating PHP and mana

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.830 
you're still regenerating PHP and mana
so<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> means<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.820> teleport<00:00:39.360> earlier

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
so this means you can teleport earlier

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
so this means you can teleport earlier
so<00:00:40.140> during<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> channel<00:00:41.010> you'll<00:00:41.160> reach<00:00:41.370> your

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so during the channel you'll reach your

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.450 
so during the channel you'll reach your
full<00:00:41.700> HP<00:00:41.969> by<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> end<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.260> teleport<00:00:43.770> 3.5

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
full HP by the end the teleport 3.5

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
full HP by the end the teleport 3.5
seconds<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.230> time<00:00:46.469> seen

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
seconds so you don't be as time seen

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.100 
seconds so you don't be as time seen
below<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.270> know<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> tactic<00:00:48.930> let's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
below so now you know the tactic let's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
below so now you know the tactic let's
look<00:00:49.200> into<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.649> maths<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
look into some maths of what when you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.639 
look into some maths of what when you
actually<00:00:51.090> use<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> teleport<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
actually use the teleport to the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
actually use the teleport to the
percentage<00:00:53.399> point<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.870> currently

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
percentage point the currently

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.740 
percentage point the currently
gives<00:00:55.410> back<00:00:55.590> 2.1<00:00:56.399> percent<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> maximum<00:00:57.300> PHP

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
gives back 2.1 percent of maximum PHP

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
gives back 2.1 percent of maximum PHP
and<00:00:57.960> mana<00:00:58.350> /<00:00:59.210> 0.25<00:01:00.210> seconds<00:01:00.980> teleport<00:01:01.980> 2<00:01:02.129> x<00:01:02.250> 3.5

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and mana / 0.25 seconds teleport 2 x 3.5

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.120 
and mana / 0.25 seconds teleport 2 x 3.5
seconds<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.640> 3.5<00:01:05.640> seconds<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.240> teleport<00:01:06.689> /

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
seconds so 3.5 seconds for teleport /

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.250 
seconds so 3.5 seconds for teleport /
0.25<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> basically<00:01:09.330> dividing<00:01:09.930> how<00:01:10.080> many

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
0.25 this is basically dividing how many

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.640 
0.25 this is basically dividing how many
tix<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.340> between<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.479> teleport<00:01:13.080> so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
tix you get in between the teleport so

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850 
tix you get in between the teleport so
0.25<00:01:14.549> every<00:01:15.210> 0.25<00:01:15.930> seconds<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> tech

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
0.25 every 0.25 seconds you get a tech

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670 
0.25 every 0.25 seconds you get a tech
and<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.490> divided<00:01:18.030> inside<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and that's divided inside over the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.219 
and that's divided inside over the
teleport<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.600> multiply<00:01:22.080> how

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
teleport time from here we multiply how

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
teleport time from here we multiply how
much<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> percentage<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.939> every

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
much you percentage you get for every

seconds so overall during your teleport
channel<00:01:36.180> list<00:01:36.329> means<00:01:36.540> roughly<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.049> third<00:01:37.530> or

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
channel list means roughly a third or

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.370 
channel list means roughly a third or
more<00:01:38.189> specifically<00:01:38.840> 29.4<00:01:39.840> percent<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> your

more specifically 29.4 percent of your
HP<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.040> mana<00:01:41.729> will<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> restored<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.079> look<00:01:43.590> at

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
HP and mana will be restored so look at

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
HP and mana will be restored so look at
the<00:01:43.829> bar<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.729> thirty<00:01:45.240> percent

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the bar with for about thirty percent

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
the bar with for about thirty percent
thirty-three<00:01:46.229> percent<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.829> done<00:01:47.040> then

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
thirty-three percent to be done then

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
thirty-three percent to be done then
start<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> teleport<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.320> wait<00:01:49.590> until<00:01:49.829> you've

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
start the teleport so wait until you've

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
start the teleport so wait until you've
around<00:01:50.250> seventy<00:01:50.820> percent<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.270> PHP<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.170> cast

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
around seventy percent of PHP then cast

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.310
