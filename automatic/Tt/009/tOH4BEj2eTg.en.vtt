you would use an open hand fighting let
me<00:00:23.750> show<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.020> one<00:00:24.170> that<00:00:24.290> we<00:00:24.410> use<00:00:24.680> against<00:00:25.279> a

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
me show you one that we use against a

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.880 
me show you one that we use against a
linear<00:00:25.610> tap<00:00:25.910> haven't<00:00:26.450> come<00:00:26.570> on<00:00:26.660> out<00:00:26.750> here<00:00:26.960> so

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
linear tap haven't come on out here so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.350 
linear tap haven't come on out here so
when<00:00:28.130> we<00:00:28.220> use<00:00:28.250> two<00:00:28.579> arms<00:00:28.939> we're<00:00:29.090> going<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.270> use

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
when we use two arms we're going to use

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.179 
when we use two arms we're going to use
a<00:00:29.390> technique<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:30.020> which<00:00:30.050> one<00:00:30.410> called<00:00:30.650> Kwan<00:00:30.980> sau

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
a technique in which one called Kwan sau

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.330 
a technique in which one called Kwan sau
Kwan<00:00:32.000> sau<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:32.540> tonsil<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.350> top<00:00:33.649> box<00:00:33.950> on<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
Kwan sau is tonsil and top box on the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.979 
Kwan sau is tonsil and top box on the
bottom<00:00:34.700> we'd<00:00:35.239> like<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.480> squeeze<00:00:35.840> them

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
bottom we'd like to squeeze them

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.330 
bottom we'd like to squeeze them
together<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.530> Candy's<00:00:36.890> being<00:00:37.100> shown<00:00:37.250> we

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
together and Candy's being shown we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.100 
together and Candy's being shown we
actually<00:00:37.610> call<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.910> loin<00:00:38.180> limb<00:00:38.420> but<00:00:38.989> we're

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
actually call this a loin limb but we're

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.620 
actually call this a loin limb but we're
going<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:39.260> refer<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:39.739> as<00:00:39.920> Kwan<00:00:40.220> sau<00:00:40.630> with

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
going to refer to this as Kwan sau with

the Kwan sau block he's gonna come at me

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.700 
the Kwan sau block he's gonna come at me
with<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.610> linear<00:00:43.910> thrust<00:00:44.600> what<00:00:45.320> I<00:00:45.350> want<00:00:45.560> to<00:00:45.620> do

town I'm gonna have the tongs out on top
for<00:01:06.500> protection<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.009> could<00:01:07.159> see<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.520> this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
for protection you could see that this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.280 
for protection you could see that this
would<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.030> worst<00:01:08.210> case<00:01:08.479> scenario<00:01:09.049> and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
would be the worst case scenario and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.330 
would be the worst case scenario and
then<00:01:09.530> I'm<00:01:09.619> going<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.799> go<00:01:09.860> into<00:01:10.070> a<00:01:10.100> very<00:01:10.310> simple

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
then I'm going to go into a very simple

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.889 
then I'm going to go into a very simple
sticking<00:01:13.340> technique<00:01:13.729> in<00:01:13.880> which<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:14.539> I<00:01:14.630> will

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
sticking technique in which then I will

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.809 
sticking technique in which then I will
disarm<00:01:15.499> the<00:01:15.649> opponent<00:01:16.069> so<00:01:16.399> go<00:01:16.520> ahead<00:01:16.579> and<00:01:16.670> come

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
disarm the opponent so go ahead and come

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.749 
disarm the opponent so go ahead and come
at<00:01:16.939> me<00:01:17.229> as<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:18.289> get<00:01:18.499> from<00:01:18.679> here<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.159> come<00:01:19.549> to<00:01:19.670> here

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
at me as I get from here I come to here

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.840 
at me as I get from here I come to here
I<00:01:19.999> stick<00:01:20.329> to<00:01:20.359> him<00:01:20.600> here<00:01:20.810> control<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.069> arm<00:01:22.429> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
I stick to him here control the arm the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.059 
I stick to him here control the arm the
way<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.060> want<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.479> use<00:01:23.810> proper<00:01:24.619> leverage<00:01:24.829> is

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
way I want to use proper leverage is

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.709 
way I want to use proper leverage is
control<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.670> arm<00:01:25.880> down<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:26.630> he

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
control this arm down to here now he

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.539 
control this arm down to here now he
can't<00:01:27.109> move<00:01:27.229> at<00:01:27.350> all<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.679> this<00:01:27.770> split<00:01:28.009> second<00:01:28.399> I

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
can't move at all in this split second I

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.910 
can't move at all in this split second I
come<00:01:29.060> up<00:01:29.179> here<00:01:29.389> to<00:01:29.450> control<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.020> weapon<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:30.499> I

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
come up here to control the weapon and I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.469 
come up here to control the weapon and I
bring<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.219> weapon<00:01:31.460> back<00:01:31.549> into<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.969> you<00:01:32.299> can

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
bring the weapon back into it you can

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.149 
bring the weapon back into it you can
see<00:01:32.509> what's<00:01:32.810> gonna<00:01:32.929> happen<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.409> us<00:01:33.439> arm<00:01:33.710> he's
