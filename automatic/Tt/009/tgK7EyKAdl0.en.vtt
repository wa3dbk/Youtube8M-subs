00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.520 
really don't so what are you gonna do
today<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.680> tap<00:01:51.370> into<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.030> role<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.570> acting

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
today to tap into the role of acting

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530 
today to tap into the role of acting
that<00:01:53.560> very<00:01:54.400> character<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.300> can't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
that very character that you can't

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.860 
that very character that you can't
relate<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.400> well<00:01:57.400> I<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.850> think<00:01:58.210> most<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
relate to well I I think most of the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.370 
relate to well I I think most of the
characters<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.030> play<00:02:01.390> or<00:02:01.900> not<00:02:02.140> a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
characters that that I play or not a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.460 
characters that that I play or not a
reflection<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.370> myself<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:05.110> really<00:02:05.380> just

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
reflection of myself so it really just

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.649 
reflection of myself so it really just
taps<00:02:05.979> into<00:02:06.220> this<00:02:06.970> character<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.540> I've

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
taps into this character that I've

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.289 
taps into this character that I've
created<00:02:07.990> for<00:02:08.470> myself<00:02:09.039> that's<00:02:09.849> in<00:02:10.090> my

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
created for myself that's in my

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.260 
created for myself that's in my
repertoire<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.500> an

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
repertoire that is an

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.750 
repertoire that is an
normal<00:02:13.020> female<00:02:13.220> well<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> think<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.700> just

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
normal female well I think it's just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.160 
normal female well I think it's just
like<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> mental<00:02:15.450> thing<00:02:15.510> when<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:15.990> super
