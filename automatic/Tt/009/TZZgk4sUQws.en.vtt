 with no fewer than five milk functions 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.860
 the water basin is considerably less than 1.7 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.740
 liters 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.230

 grinding discs 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 very durable 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.600
 in the end you always start just like me 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.920
 with the menu 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.750
 there is a descaling called that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.909
 means that you can set that and that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.080
 the machine then the entire descaling 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.690
 if you have added the substance 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.500
 completed 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.809
 you can set the time then it is a clock 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.800
 you can switch off automatically by 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.800
 to set that up 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.630
 you still don't think you can 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.190
 take care of 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.940
 temperature can you set then I would 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.920
 say set him a position of the maximum 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.549

 really 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.030
 there time of the water that can take you 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.680
 ask your water supplier 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.870
 Sound can define you 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.100

 do you want to adjust the amount thereof 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.750
 hold the button the first time 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.550
 until the coffee has reached the height 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.050
 the cup or the nice coffee glass 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.070
 what let loose your desire and he is 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.750
 adjusted 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.120
 he does the same with two buttons 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.410
 not difficult at all 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.750
 with this push button you can be precise 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.420
 get indicated for which coffee in 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 basically all choose the flavor only counts 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.110
 you actually agree with that 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.720
 and the state now you mail goes to normal 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.100
 you go to strong and then you go to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.950
 extra strong aroma the type of coffee that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.650
 can be set with by pressing the button 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.420
 then I have a small head 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 now I have an extra strong aroma 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.310
 And I have 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.310
 crap an espresso that you like 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.870

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.700
 well at least this is my size 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.050
 there is a nice cream layer on this one 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.790
 about 60 ml 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.060
 don't think the little one is well 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.060
 taste 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.700
 he is pruning hot he would be one for me 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.670
 while back may itself then taste 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.270
 really what I really needed 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.270
 delicious is that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.300
 This button is the button to turn the machine on 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 command to flush and this button 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.980
 is not just the ok button 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.080
 working in the menu but also the button 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.400
 the descaling program it is starting now 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.720
 let's go to a very important one 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.379
 part of there has that machine 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.049
 actually 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.390
 he is unique in that he still has it 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.959
 more from the lombok 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.280
 the cappuccino one touch that we go like that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.390
 trying out 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.950
 that's nice because then you only have to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.840
 just press the button and wait 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.430
 your entire cappuccino is ready 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.290
 but there is still something special he has 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.900
 the my button 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.180
 milk when I press it here it sees 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.549
 Already appear among other things and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.010
 latte macchiato and cafe latte 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.989
 and so there are three more types of milk 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.850
 products with coffee that we use with this 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.300
 machine can put 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.940
 5 milk products and that is unique 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.949
 the spout goes down the foam 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.979
 pipe that is extendable not to 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.979
 we also spill down 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.979
 cappuccino 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.430
 zoÃ« ja well she doesn't see that every day 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
 the foam is very fine-meshed 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.620
 and what I always want to see is that one 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.340
 low and there is a nice one 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.300
 Cappuccino and if you are wondering with more fit 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.949
 would like to have 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.180
 put it underneath and bigger one 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.310
 nespresso 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.449
 then you have a strong cappuccino but 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.449
 this one will do it 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.570
 he is incredibly hot striking at 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.220
 the lung you get on the whole 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.840
 easy off 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.020
 look and here he has the three positions 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.040
 button he is now on cappuccino 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.169
 he goes straight to a latte macchiato and 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.580
 goes straight to a cafe latte 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.470
 What is also nice is that you get the parts 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.530
 both the pipe 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.789
 you can take it off and you can do this pipe 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.560
 take off 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.330
 that is possible in the dishwasher you have 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.310
 of course the flushing system for it 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.100
 Cappuccino portion but then you can do this 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.910
 you can just share in the dishwasher 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.910
 run with it 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.910
 the water basin is on the side 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.490
 so no problem with cupboards on the 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.729
 top is a hefty baker of 1.7 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.520
 liter of grinding the beans is very quiet 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.530
 I just noticed that and when I notice this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.930
 lies then I also see that there is a fat one 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.409
 rubber edge that has all the vibration 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.929
 keep noise indoors 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.059
 that's nice that is now nice and mobile 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:30.189
 continue to call while you have coffee 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.539
 We are now going to leave the brew group 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.639
 see where it is but then you must first 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.619
 turn off the machine 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.779
 you take the water tank away that is 

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:39.550
 not difficult 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:41.830
 you open this cover on the 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.809
 top that is also not complicated 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.959
 then you press those two red protrusions 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:49.749
 and then you have the wonderful thing 

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:51.849

 rinse with lukewarm water 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.669
 but nothing more 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:06.669
 you press the red wings again and 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.619
 you can put it in its place very easily 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:11.069
 until you hear a click 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.069
 cover closed 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.929
 water is a true place and you 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:19.360

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:34.539
 receptacle of what we call cookies 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:37.869
 and this actually includes rinsing water 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:39.249
