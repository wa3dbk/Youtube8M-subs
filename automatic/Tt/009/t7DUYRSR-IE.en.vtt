now I haven't used the white or the pink

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600 
now I haven't used the white or the pink
I've<00:00:45.270> only<00:00:45.690> used<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.559> clear<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> dark

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I've only used the clear and the dark

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.709

blue<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.149> far

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
blue so far

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.819 
blue so far
I<00:00:49.340> recommend<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> clear<00:00:51.410> probably<00:00:52.410> about<00:00:54.829> 8

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I recommend the clear probably about 8

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.060 
I recommend the clear probably about 8
out<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> 10<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:57.170> with<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> brush<00:00:58.680> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
out of 10 because with the brush it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
out of 10 because with the brush it's
probably<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.910> applying<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:00.539> not<00:01:00.719> sure

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
probably just me applying I'm not sure
but<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.300> best<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.659> it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
but it's just not the best like and it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630 
but it's just not the best like and it's
just<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> powder

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
