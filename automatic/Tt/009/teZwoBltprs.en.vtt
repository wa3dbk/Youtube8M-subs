the<00:00:19.949> only<00:00:20.070> tool<00:00:20.369> you'll<00:00:20.550> need<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> eight

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the only tool you'll need is the eight

the only tool you'll need is the eight
millimeter<00:00:21.689> socket<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> ratchet<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
millimeter socket with a ratchet and a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460 
millimeter socket with a ratchet and a
small<00:00:23.310> extension<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.449> most<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.869> these<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.230> bad

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
small extension but most of these go bad

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.519 
small extension but most of these go bad
because<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.430> contacts<00:00:27.029> corrode<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.230> you'll

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
because the contacts corrode so you'll

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
because the contacts corrode so you'll
need<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.890> needle<00:00:29.130> nose<00:00:29.279> pliers<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.939> well<00:00:30.060> as

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
need some needle nose pliers as well as

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.610 
need some needle nose pliers as well as
a<00:00:30.210> flat<00:00:30.420> blade<00:00:30.599> screwdriver<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:32.099> force<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
a flat blade screwdriver to force the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.760 
a flat blade screwdriver to force the
resistor<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.340> harness<00:00:36.000> plug<00:00:36.510> apart<00:00:37.469> and

resistor and the harness plug apart and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430 
resistor and the harness plug apart and
then<00:00:38.399> some<00:00:38.640> penetrating<00:00:39.059> oil<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.480> grease<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
then some penetrating oil and grease to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.030 
then some penetrating oil and grease to
condition<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:43.079> contacts<00:00:43.590> before<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
condition the the contacts before you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:58.270 
condition the the contacts before you
put<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> back<00:00:44.370> together<00:00:46.760> okay<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> Keyon

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.729 

now<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.489> listen<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.000> hear<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
now if you listen you can hear the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.910 
now if you listen you can hear the
blower<00:01:01.949> motor<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.570> turn<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:06.920> don't

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
blower motor as I turn it up you don't

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
blower motor as I turn it up you don't
really<00:01:08.040> hear<00:01:08.369> any<00:01:08.689> difference<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> sound

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
really hear any difference in the sound

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.980 
really hear any difference in the sound
of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> motor<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> high

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.960 

so<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.080> basically<00:01:16.290> missing<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.550> two<00:01:17.610> middle

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
so I'm basically missing my two middle

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
so I'm basically missing my two middle
speeds<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.050> not<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> switch<00:01:22.650> it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.200 
is it right here and it's held in by two
eight<00:01:36.330> millimeter<00:01:36.840> screws<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.550> there<00:01:38.820> and

eight millimeter screws one up there and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.150 
eight millimeter screws one up there and
then<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.350> down<00:01:40.560> below<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
then there's one down below that you

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.200 
then there's one down below that you
can't<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:43.610> okay<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> bottom<00:01:45.060> one

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
can't really see okay for the bottom one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
can't really see okay for the bottom one
I've<00:01:45.330> been<00:01:45.420> eight<00:01:45.600> millimeter<00:01:46.020> socket<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
I've been eight millimeter socket if you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.440 
I've been eight millimeter socket if you
have<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> small<00:01:47.430> extension<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> it'll

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
have a small extension like that it'll

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.029 
have a small extension like that it'll
help<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.410> just<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.830> with<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
help but you can just do it with the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.420 
help but you can just do it with the
socket<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.490> ratchet<00:01:55.039> okay<00:01:56.039> I'm<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.310> going

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
socket and ratchet okay I'm just going

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.980 
socket and ratchet okay I'm just going
to<00:01:56.460> hit<00:01:56.580> fast-forward<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.690> don't<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to hit fast-forward here so you don't to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
to hit fast-forward here so you don't to
sit<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:58.649> watch<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.070> hands<00:01:59.280> work<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
sit there watch my hands work in a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.789 
sit there watch my hands work in a
ratchet

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.980 

once<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.759> bolts<00:02:06.939> not<00:02:07.119> given<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.570> ratchet

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
once the bolts not given the ratchet

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.089 
once the bolts not given the ratchet
much

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
much

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:18.319 
much
and<00:02:09.939> take<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.420> out<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.599> rest<00:02:10.780> loop<00:02:11.049> your<00:02:11.290> hand

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.470 

and<00:02:19.329> again<00:02:19.689> fast<00:02:20.049> forward<00:02:20.409> for<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.590> top<00:02:20.950> bolt

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and again fast forward for that top bolt

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.179 
and again fast forward for that top bolt
use<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.599> ratchet<00:02:22.749> and<00:02:23.109> then<00:02:23.379> once<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.829> doesn't

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
use the ratchet and then once it doesn't

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:32.399 
use the ratchet and then once it doesn't
give<00:02:24.280> resistance<00:02:24.730> use<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.269> hand<00:02:31.170> okay

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
give resistance use your hand okay

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.530 
give resistance use your hand okay
you<00:02:32.859> might<00:02:33.069> ask<00:02:33.219> why<00:02:33.430> didn't<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.819> unplug<00:02:34.420> it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you might ask why didn't I unplug it

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.780 
you might ask why didn't I unplug it
first<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:36.040> generally<00:02:36.639> these<00:02:37.150> things<00:02:37.480> are

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
first because generally these things are

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.379 
first because generally these things are
so<00:02:39.790> corroded<00:02:40.329> together<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.209> don't

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:43.389 
so corroded together that they don't

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.459 
so corroded together that they don't
just<00:02:43.629> unplug<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.769> conventional<00:02:45.250> manner

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
just unplug in the conventional manner

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.689 
just unplug in the conventional manner
so<00:02:47.469> what<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.709> usually<00:02:47.919> do<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:50.189> take<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.340> pair<00:02:51.639> of

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:51.699 
so what I usually do is take a pair of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.390 
so what I usually do is take a pair of
needle<00:02:51.969> nose<00:02:52.120> pliers<00:02:52.530> okay<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.069> don't<00:02:54.189> want

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
needle nose pliers okay you don't want

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.959 
needle nose pliers okay you don't want
to<00:02:54.489> break<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.500> harness<00:02:57.159> part<00:02:57.669> of<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
to break the harness part of the

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:08.869 
to break the harness part of the
connection<00:02:58.599> but<00:02:58.840> I<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.750> start<00:03:05.079> breaking<00:03:07.109> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
connection but I just start breaking the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.649 
connection but I just start breaking the
resistor<00:03:09.879> side<00:03:12.150> okay<00:03:13.150> I'm<00:03:13.269> going<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.419> fast

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
resistor side okay I'm going to fast

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.499 
resistor side okay I'm going to fast
forward<00:03:13.750> here<00:03:14.139> as<00:03:14.439> I<00:03:14.650> go<00:03:14.680> at<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.310> plastic<00:03:16.239> part

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:16.509 
forward here as I go at the plastic part

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.899 
forward here as I go at the plastic part
of<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> resistor<00:03:17.379> side<00:03:17.650> again<00:03:18.129> do<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.549> break

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
of the resistor side again do not break

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.890 
of the resistor side again do not break
the<00:03:19.810> part<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.919> the<00:03:21.040> plug<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.909> the<00:03:22.419> wires

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
the part of the plug that is the wires

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.469 
the part of the plug that is the wires
go<00:03:23.199> in<00:03:23.319> -<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:24.370> want<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.669> just<00:03:24.790> break<00:03:25.120> off<00:03:25.419> the

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
go in - you want to just break off the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.979 
go in - you want to just break off the
plastic<00:03:26.199> that<00:03:26.349> is<00:03:26.409> part<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:27.009> the<00:03:27.220> resistor<00:03:27.669> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
plastic that is part of the resistor and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.479 
plastic that is part of the resistor and
you<00:03:28.989> can<00:03:29.139> look<00:03:29.290> at<00:03:29.409> your<00:03:29.530> old<00:03:29.739> your<00:03:29.979> your<00:03:30.370> new

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
you can look at your old your your new

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.280 
you can look at your old your your new
resistor<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.209> which<00:03:31.359> part<00:03:31.629> that<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
resistor to see which part that is and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.499 
resistor to see which part that is and
now<00:03:33.159> I'll<00:03:33.340> trade<00:03:33.609> in<00:03:33.759> for<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.979> screwdriver<00:03:36.509> now

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:37.509

okay<00:06:20.970> that's<00:06:21.120> installed<00:06:22.550> take<00:06:23.550> our<00:06:23.729> lead

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:38.029 

we'll<00:06:30.180> get<00:06:30.300> back<00:06:30.479> in<00:06:36.289> but<00:06:37.289> you're<00:06:37.740> gonna<00:06:37.830> want

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
we'll get back in but you're gonna want

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.249 
we'll get back in but you're gonna want
to<00:06:38.099> run<00:06:38.220> a<00:06:38.250> test<00:06:38.659> see<00:06:39.659> if<00:06:39.690> you<00:06:39.930> have<00:06:40.110> all<00:06:40.229> your

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
to run a test see if you have all your

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.640 
to run a test see if you have all your
speeds<00:06:40.650> back<00:06:40.889> I<00:06:41.159> found<00:06:41.669> on<00:06:41.849> this<00:06:42.000> truck<00:06:42.389> that<00:06:42.659> I

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
speeds back I found on this truck that I

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.740 
speeds back I found on this truck that I
actually<00:06:44.069> had<00:06:44.789> changed<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:45.509> that<00:06:45.599> was

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
actually had changed and that was

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.960 
actually had changed and that was
because<00:06:46.110> they<00:06:46.440> contacts<00:06:47.129> still<00:06:47.430> went<00:06:47.699> making

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
because they contacts still went making

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.330 
because they contacts still went making
good<00:06:48.180> contacts<00:06:49.169> will<00:06:49.409> actually<00:06:49.710> unplugged<00:06:50.190> it

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
good contacts will actually unplugged it

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.089 
good contacts will actually unplugged it
again<00:06:51.139> sprayed<00:06:52.139> some<00:06:52.379> more<00:06:52.560> penetrating<00:06:52.979> oil

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
again sprayed some more penetrating oil

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.180 
again sprayed some more penetrating oil
in<00:06:53.370> there<00:06:53.550> then<00:06:54.330> we<00:06:54.509> plugged<00:06:54.810> it<00:06:54.960> in<00:06:55.110> and<00:06:55.379> just

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
in there then we plugged it in and just

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.760 
in there then we plugged it in and just
kind<00:06:56.819> of<00:06:56.849> move<00:06:57.090> the<00:06:57.120> connector<00:06:57.770> connection

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
kind of move the connector connection
