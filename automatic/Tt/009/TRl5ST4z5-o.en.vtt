00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it in reverse it gives you this screen

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.670 
it in reverse it gives you this screen
and<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:26.370> push<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.329> these

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.750 

and<00:03:30.680> it'll<00:03:30.890> change<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.430> angle<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:34.430> here<00:03:34.640> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
and it'll change the angle so here you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.400 
and it'll change the angle so here you
have<00:03:34.850> your<00:03:34.940> top-down<00:03:35.420> mode<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.080> comes<00:03:36.290> in

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
have your top-down mode that comes in

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.940 
have your top-down mode that comes in
handy<00:03:36.590> especially<00:03:37.360> when<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:38.750> are<00:03:39.380> parallel

let's<00:03:43.160> put<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.400> back<00:03:43.550> into<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.820> drive<00:03:44.090> show

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
let's put it back into the drive show

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.970 
let's put it back into the drive show
you<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:44.990> navigation<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.750> say<00:03:48.020> I'm<00:03:48.380> driving

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
you this navigation so say I'm driving

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.210 
you this navigation so say I'm driving

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
can actually say set as destination

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.930 
can actually say set as destination
would<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:49.910> like<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.980> set<00:04:51.980> as<00:04:52.190> destination

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.840 

BAM<00:04:59.860> proceed<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.130> highlighted<00:05:01.280> route

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
BAM proceed to the highlighted route

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.920 
BAM proceed to the highlighted route
then<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:02.690> route<00:05:02.870> guns<00:05:03.230> will<00:05:03.560> start<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:05.840> of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
then the route guns will start one of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.020 
then the route guns will start one of
the<00:05:06.020> cool<00:05:06.200> things<00:05:06.230> about<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:07.220> navigation

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
the cool things about this navigation

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.160 
the cool things about this navigation
system<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.140> works<00:05:09.380> with<00:05:10.000> FM<00:05:11.170> signals

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
system is that it works with FM signals

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.410 
system is that it works with FM signals
instead<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.860> satellite<00:05:13.550> signals<00:05:14.000> so

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
instead of satellite signals so

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.930 
instead of satellite signals so
rerouting<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.380> all<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:16.040> is<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.550> lot

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
rerouting and all of that is a lot

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.960 
rerouting and all of that is a lot
faster<00:05:17.570> now<00:05:17.780> with<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.860> voice<00:05:19.010> activation<00:05:19.550> I

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
faster now with the voice activation I

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.660 
faster now with the voice activation I
mean<00:05:20.330> I'd<00:05:20.510> be<00:05:20.540> able<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.930> say<00:05:21.800> find<00:05:22.100> nearest<00:05:22.340> gas

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
mean I'd be able to say find nearest gas

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.210 
mean I'd be able to say find nearest gas
station<00:05:22.700> find<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.750> nearest<00:05:23.930> barbeque<00:05:24.770> find

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
station find the nearest barbeque find

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.130 
station find the nearest barbeque find
nearest<00:05:25.460> Chinese<00:05:25.940> food<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.840> can<00:05:26.990> play

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
nearest Chinese food so you can play
