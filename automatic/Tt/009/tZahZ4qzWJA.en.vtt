Plantronics Mark II now I say Mikey but

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.820 
Plantronics Mark II now I say Mikey but
I<00:00:12.780> watched<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.200> video<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> plantronics

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I watched a video on the plantronics

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.939 
I watched a video on the plantronics
website<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:14.820> said<00:00:15.000> mark<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.109> however

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
website and they said mark so however

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.260 
website and they said mark so however
you<00:00:17.039> decide<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.340> pronounce<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you decide to pronounce it it's up to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.929 
you decide to pronounce it it's up to
you<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.920> obviously<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.580> bluetooth

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you now this is obviously a bluetooth

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.679 
you now this is obviously a bluetooth
earpiece<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.730> basically<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.939> only<00:00:24.090> weighs<00:00:24.390> 7

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
earpiece and basically it only weighs 7

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.410 
earpiece and basically it only weighs 7
grams<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.650> super<00:00:26.220> light<00:00:26.550> when<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> put<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
grams so it's super light when I put it

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
grams so it's super light when I put it
in<00:00:27.480> my<00:00:27.539> ear<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.439> forget<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.949> it's

experience that I had with it I was

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.090 
experience that I had with it I was
probably<00:01:10.290> getting<00:01:10.380> around<00:01:10.710> four<00:01:10.799> four<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:10.979> a

probably getting around four four and a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.109 
probably getting around four four and a
half<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.689> 45<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.000> one<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
half you know for 45 and one of the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
half you know for 45 and one of the
great<00:01:15.270> things<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.810> turn<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
great things when you do turn it on is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
great things when you do turn it on is
that<00:01:16.920> announces<00:01:17.460> -<00:01:17.670> yes<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> yes<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that announces - yes it's on yes it's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
that announces - yes it's on yes it's
connected<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.340> you've<00:01:20.340> got<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.030> three

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
connected and you've got you know three

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.910 
connected and you've got you know three
hours<00:01:21.600> talktime<00:01:21.840> left<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.530> something<00:01:22.830> like

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
hours talktime left or something like

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.230 
hours talktime left or something like
that<00:01:22.979> which<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.640> helpful<00:01:23.880> when<00:01:24.090> you're

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that which is really helpful when you're

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700 
that which is really helpful when you're
actually<00:01:24.330> wondering<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> need<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
actually wondering when you need to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually wondering when you need to
charge<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.400> don't<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.909> call<00:01:27.600> where

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
charge so you don't get that call where

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
charge so you don't get that call where
it<00:01:27.900> says<00:01:28.049> low<00:01:28.229> batter<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it says low batter and you get all of it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
it says low batter and you get all of it
I<00:01:29.579> wish<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> knew

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I wish I knew

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
I wish I knew
so<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.259> gives<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> notice<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
so it's good it gives you that notice it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
so it's good it gives you that notice it
does<00:01:32.909> weigh<00:01:33.030> only<00:01:33.090> seven<00:01:33.450> grams<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.840> said<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
does weigh only seven grams I said that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.370 
does weigh only seven grams I said that
you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.090> plenty<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.240> battery<00:01:36.600> life<00:01:36.750> really

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you know plenty of battery life really

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740
