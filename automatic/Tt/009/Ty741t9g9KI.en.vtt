involved with any product and I'd be

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179

a situation that's not discussed nearly
enough<00:01:14.040> today<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.970> resurgent<00:01:15.840> love<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
enough today is the resurgent love of

and for example we covered this on

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
and for example we covered this on
secular<00:01:21.810> talk<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> year<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:22.770> ago<00:01:22.890> about<00:01:23.759> how

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
remember reading the quotes in the story

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.730 
remember reading the quotes in the story
at<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:36.329> basically<00:01:36.600> said<00:01:37.170> well

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
at the time and they basically said well

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
at the time and they basically said well
yeah<00:01:38.130> Mussolini<00:01:38.759> had<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> downsides

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
yeah Mussolini had a lot of downsides

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.140 
yeah Mussolini had a lot of downsides
but<00:01:40.049> he<00:01:40.320> did<00:01:40.530> create<00:01:41.040> order<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> trains

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
but he did create order and the trains

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.649 
but he did create order and the trains
ran<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:44.310> thought<00:01:44.520> oh<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
ran on time and I thought oh this is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.920 
ran on time and I thought oh this is
fucking<00:01:46.380> scary<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:48.000> we're<00:01:48.329> having<00:01:48.689> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
fucking scary because we're having a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.100 
fucking scary because we're having a
turn<00:01:49.380> towards<00:01:49.860> radicalism<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.119> many<00:01:51.630> ways<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
turn towards radicalism in many ways to

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
turn towards radicalism in many ways to
for<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> record<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.020> radical

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
for the record it's not just a radical

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
for the record it's not just a radical
turn<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.100> many<00:01:56.280> places<00:01:56.579> there's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
turn to the right in many places there's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
turn to the right in many places there's
also<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.149> radical<00:01:57.630> turn<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> left<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.979> if

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
also a radical turn to the left so if

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
also a radical turn to the left so if
you<00:01:59.130> look<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> Greece<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.119> example<00:02:00.180> there's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you look in Greece for example there's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.069 
you look in Greece for example there's
the<00:02:00.930> Golden<00:02:01.409> Dawn<00:02:01.740> party<00:02:02.479> they<00:02:03.479> are<00:02:03.509> flat-out

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079

the Golden Dawn party they are flat-out
upfront<00:02:04.799> about<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> fact<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:06.299> believe

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
upfront about the fact that they believe

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.499 
upfront about the fact that they believe
in<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> neo-nazi<00:02:07.290> ideology<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.300> also<00:02:09.300> they

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
in a neo-nazi ideology and also they

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930 
in a neo-nazi ideology and also they
hold<00:02:09.780> eighteen<00:02:10.590> seats<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.640> Greek
