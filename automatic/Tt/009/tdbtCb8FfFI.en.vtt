00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.619
 Yes 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.869
 hello to all of you we wait 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.400
 as intel and you then me it goes well 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.660
 still you dance tales opens 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.390
 today in a new video where 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.369
 I will give you two techniques for 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.540
 can acquire store and have all 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.730
 applications that is found 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.860
 for free so I will present 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 two tips one that will work with 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.850
 a jailbreak is a water that goes 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.190
 run without jailbreak like that while 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.110
 the world is good is able to 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.430
 hacker the appstore there of course it is a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.840
 technique that is much simpler 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.340
 than another another that is a lot 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.700
 more complete than the other et cetera and 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.980
 so 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.269
 each technique to his advantage but 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.039
 it's always better than nothing 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.829
 and in general you find the application 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.120
 that you want then of course there is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.710
 some flaws in what I'm doing to you 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.399
 proposes since sometimes the app store can 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.960
 realize it 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.489
 and when he offers you to do a 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.199
 update on an application that he 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.149
 detects and is installed on your 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.039
 device it tells you like what when 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.629
 you want to start the update that 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.550
 it was not installed with your 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.230
 apple id and that the update 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.880
 so is impossible so do not you 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.680
 do not worry it does not matter 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080
 day after is done with 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.190
 the application is automatically so 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.560
 the first solution that I propose to you 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.070
 it is done without jet break or with 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.930
 child break 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.280
 it's like you want it so you 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.470
 just go on safari 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.180
 and once in safari go on v 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.890
 thiers.com so you will also find 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.210
 to read in the description and you have 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.820
 a guy they post and the deal on 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.320
 the screen of your device so once 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.729
 you go on this link you have 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.640
 two possible solutions 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.390
 you firstly download wendel 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.340
 broken and our jake is so between ken 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 means not jailbroken and jabrane 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 means djeric and so you click 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.840
 the link and well that suits you the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.340
 better 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.689
 so if you do not have a device that 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 was pointed at you click on this link 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.530
 and if you have a manufactured device 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.759
 you click on the second once 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.859
 that the vaitiare application is 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.450
 downloaded it's very simple it you 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.549
 simply go to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.930
 inside so you launch it yourself 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.579
 have a small load time and a 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.439
 Once the application is launched you 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.369
 you can start a search so 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.479
 to start a search is very 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.500
 simple you press the little button 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.509
 what is at the top 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.960
 right here and in addition you're typing by 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.250
 example nba touquet 15 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.230
 once you load time is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.910
 ended you simply bind on 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 the application you want and a movie 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.460
 could see that we have a small logo 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.770
 green you're just here 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.120
 and who will you say download so 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.190
 simply have to click on 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.660
 the little green logo and then it's good 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.160
 you can then go to the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.290
 download category is located 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
 sending everything here once inside 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.470
 to find all your downloads 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.180
 which are ongoing and once the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.070
 applications will be downloaded you 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.360
 just make a small slip to the 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.150
 left and so you will be able 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.800
 install the apps you have 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.030
 downloaded to install them you 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.500
 just click on the little button 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.550
 install and you wait a few 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.860
 second then once you have 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.840
 waited this written the name of the server is 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.850
 would be installed for example lice and you 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.350
 then click on install you 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.670
 wait a few seconds then 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.960
 you can return to the screen 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.600
 of reception is found that the application 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.860
 is downloading 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.050
 the second solution that I show you 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.540
 and it's with the anthem store for radio 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.340
 and of course follows this flagship software 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.780
 it's rather this tweak cydia is available 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.070
 on the source of her dress that I you 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.410
 just display on your screen 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.400
 so I invite you to install it and it 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.780
 will allow you to see her well 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.920
 small module in the app store for 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.570
 download all apps 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 free so to install it yourself 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.990
 click here and so it's okay 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.430
 install it once installed there is 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.690
 no setting in business 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.790
 especially although in the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.170
 category settings you have everything from 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.330
 even find that lice is in the process 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.740
 to install finally brief let's go back to 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.970
 winston or once you have it 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.860
 install you still have a small 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.390
 settings panel you too you 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.220
 go in my settings we and the winged 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.710
 in the tweak panel you 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.030
 go down and you open the panel of 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.040
 preferences of the tweak called 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.300
 gilles store so inside you 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.880
 can do a lot of things 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.140
 so you can have at file installed 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.300
 to install applications for a 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.590
 dead hand if you have a paf package to 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.570
 the gives this option you can 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.640
 choose for example disable the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.620
 buttons and so on et cetera you have 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.290
 no small option to activate 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.580
 so iphone servers that is that nan nan 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.140
 because you downloaded some 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.430
 thing so for now is not going too much 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.900
 get interested the settings only serves 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.520
 strictly for nothing so if you do not 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.840
 set nothing is the same but then 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.070
 what did you install the trick there you 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.130
 just go to the app 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.130
 blind 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.859
 once you go to the app 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.750
 store will simply select 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.150
 the application that in normal times 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.890
 pay and you'll see you go 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.420
 can see that we have a new 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.650
 little liart his daughter called get 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.479
 with line store and steam 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.860
 here you simply click on 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.120
 this little island is one when you 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.770
 clicked all that will redirect you 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.990
 here we will tell you what by 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.509
 example we have here 31 links that they are 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.850
 provided you will then have to open 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.729
 one of the links that appears so by 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.770
 example I try file share bobbitt etc 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.250
 etc and me what I want is a link 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.050
 direct 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.610
 because in fact you see here we have 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.690
 enumerated described for example here fault 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.160
 pop and so on and so on 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.750
 and well what you slip you can 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.229
 install it but it will not be a link 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.419
 direct 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.400
 it will be via a server and if the server 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.810
 is not available farges made simple 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.000
 it's a lot more complex in reality 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.650
 but I make it simple so if the server 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.240
 for example is not available it does not 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.979
 could not download then if it's 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.449
 live is inevitably available 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.100
 so you make a small slip 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.960
 like those here you click on the 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.430
 little share button was described 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.870
 in the aude will start immediate beds 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.210
 which of course you have ads 1 this 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.010
 is not necessarily very very maybe 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.330
 not very sure I never say but it's this 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.910
 is not without ads so this is your 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.680
 download is in progress so here is 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.500
 I'm done with these two methods for 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.060
 able to install this application which 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.810
 are paid in mass on the app store 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.180
 free 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.099
 you have here the elevator and garonne is 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.900
 here the medshare link I invite you to 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.010
 go there and then I tell you to the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.810
 next we wanted to do that you have 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.490
 much more benefited from this tutorial and I 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.490
 tell you to the next hi
