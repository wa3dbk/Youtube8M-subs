winning the industry for a long time now
and<00:00:02.669> over<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.780> last<00:00:03.959> few<00:00:04.200> years<00:00:04.290> we've<00:00:04.830> been

and over the last few years we've been

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.000 
and over the last few years we've been
very<00:00:05.069> lucky<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:06.240> follow<00:00:06.779> numerous<00:00:07.500> athletes

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
very lucky to follow numerous athletes

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.459 
very lucky to follow numerous athletes
from<00:00:08.250> start<00:00:08.670> their<00:00:08.880> journey<00:00:09.110> right<00:00:10.110> through

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
from start their journey right through

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.650 
from start their journey right through
to<00:00:10.679> when<00:00:10.830> they<00:00:10.980> get<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.250> stage<00:00:11.660> that's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
to when they get on stage that's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.010 
to when they get on stage that's
phenomenal<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.639> just<00:00:14.639> how<00:00:14.730> great<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
phenomenal to see just how great the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
phenomenal to see just how great the
achievements<00:00:16.800> those<00:00:17.039> people<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.609> made<00:00:17.850> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
achievements those people have made and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.890 
achievements those people have made and
the<00:00:18.840> sacrifices<00:00:19.529> they've<00:00:20.039> made<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.340> huge<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.689> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the sacrifices they've made a huge so we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
the sacrifices they've made a huge so we
wanted<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> develop<00:00:22.740> something<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.910> would

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
wanted to develop something that would

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.089 
wanted to develop something that would
make<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> journey<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:25.320> easier<00:00:25.529> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
make that journey a little bit easier so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
make that journey a little bit easier so
a<00:00:26.130> few<00:00:26.369> years<00:00:26.430> ago<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:27.660> started<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.199> develop

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
a few years ago we started to develop

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
a few years ago we started to develop
something<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.670> thought<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.449> be

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
something that we thought would be

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.530 
something that we thought would be
absolutely<00:00:31.170> incredible<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> industry

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.729 

this<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.690> always<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> difficult

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
this was always going to be a difficult

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
this was always going to be a difficult
project<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> fundamentally<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
project to take on fundamentally the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000 
project to take on fundamentally the
chemical<00:00:42.899> compounds<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.469> should<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.800> work

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
chemical compounds that should not work

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.770 
chemical compounds that should not work
but<00:00:44.340> by<00:00:44.489> managing<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> manipulate<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but by managing to manipulate the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
but by managing to manipulate the
molecular<00:00:46.170> structure<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.950> managed<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
molecular structure we have managed to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040 
molecular structure we have managed to
make<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> breakthrough<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.510> learn<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
make a breakthrough we learn that the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
make a breakthrough we learn that the
biggest<00:00:49.500> sacrifice<00:00:50.160> athletes<00:00:51.059> make<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.690> with

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
biggest sacrifice athletes make is with

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.990 
biggest sacrifice athletes make is with
their<00:00:52.079> social<00:00:52.379> lives<00:00:52.730> they<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
their social lives they have to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
their social lives they have to
compromise<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:55.110> nights<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:55.980> friends

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
compromise on nights out with friends

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.479 
compromise on nights out with friends
and<00:00:56.670> family<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.300> they<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> eat<00:00:57.899> good

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489

and family because they want to eat good
and<00:00:59.489> train<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.239> we've<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.140> managed<00:01:01.590> to
