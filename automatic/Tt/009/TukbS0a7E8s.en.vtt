 and let's go to the flame 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.379
 at most 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:47.279
 elderly 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.799
 Now turn the sauce around a little for about two minutes 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.830
 while yours on tasting 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.919

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.180
 for this dish 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.389
 I prefer striped pens 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.580
 for 4 people you can mount 350 grams of pignataro the amount you choose 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.580
 you meanwhile the important thing is that he sent the pasta cooking 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.710
 because in a while I'll have to go inside the sauce 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.680
 after three minutes 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.139
 The time has come to take away 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.870
 and let omp dry for it. take 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.479
 a pinch of salt 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.860
 and put it on the sauce because as far as it goes, it doesn't go in August 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.339
 salento these are only prawns there are no seafood and therefore 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.389
 no more native to sarzana 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.819

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.189
 in the eyes our chilli 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.999
 as soon as our sauce has shrunk 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:46.379
 ie approximately 2 3 minutes will have passed 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.759
 it's time to put 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.050

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.879

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.580
 delicate and should not be cooked a lot will be printed then 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.580
 subsequently together with the pasta 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.690

 after blowing everything up for about a minute, the time has come 

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:54.830
