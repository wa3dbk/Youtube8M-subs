on<00:00:18.150> rough<00:00:18.570> surfaces<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.980> times<00:00:20.160> people

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
on rough surfaces a lot of times people

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.130 
on rough surfaces a lot of times people
will<00:00:20.580> comment<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.210> videos<00:00:21.510> saying<00:00:21.869> that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
will comment on my videos saying that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
will comment on my videos saying that
they<00:00:22.289> only<00:00:22.499> have<00:00:22.859> rough<00:00:23.640> surfaces<00:00:24.179> rough

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
they only have rough surfaces rough

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.329 
they only have rough surfaces rough
roads<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.650> roads<00:00:25.859> around<00:00:25.980> their<00:00:26.189> houses

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
roads the roads around their houses

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.739 
roads the roads around their houses
aren't<00:00:26.550> very<00:00:26.730> smooth<00:00:26.999> which<00:00:27.329> board<00:00:27.570> should

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
aren't very smooth which board should

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.739 
aren't very smooth which board should
they<00:00:27.839> get<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.949> response<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.489> is<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
they get my response to that is the

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.380 
they get my response to that is the
penny<00:00:31.019> due<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> its<00:00:32.310> small<00:00:32.640> size<00:00:32.669> does<00:00:33.360> not

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
penny due to its small size does not

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
penny due to its small size does not
function<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.230> rough<00:00:34.590> roads<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.880> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
function well on rough roads with that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
function well on rough roads with that
being<00:00:36.180> said<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.960> nickel<00:00:38.780> functions<00:00:39.780> better

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
being said the nickel functions better

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
being said the nickel functions better
on<00:00:40.320> rough<00:00:40.530> roads<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> wouldn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
on rough roads but I wouldn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
on rough roads but I wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:42.390> say<00:00:42.900> it<00:00:43.320> functions<00:00:43.680> well<00:00:43.860> both

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
necessarily say it functions well both

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.960 
necessarily say it functions well both
of<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.090> relatively<00:00:45.480> small<00:00:45.600> boards<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
of these are relatively small boards and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.480 
of these are relatively small boards and
due<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.000> their<00:00:48.240> small<00:00:48.600> size<00:00:48.950> they<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.160> ride

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
due to their small size they don't ride

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.990 
due to their small size they don't ride
well<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.390> rough<00:00:51.900> surfaces<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.700> you're<00:00:53.700> looking

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
well on rough surfaces if you're looking

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
well on rough surfaces if you're looking
though<00:00:54.330> for<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> board<00:00:55.380> that<00:00:55.560> functions<00:00:55.920> better

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
though for a board that functions better

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
though for a board that functions better
on<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.490> rougher<00:00:57.030> surface<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.900> nickel<00:00:58.230> will

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
on a rougher surface the nickel will

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
on a rougher surface the nickel will
function<00:00:58.530> better<00:00:58.740> that's<00:00:59.610> due<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.060> larger

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
function better that's due to the larger

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
function better that's due to the larger
size<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.450> wider<00:01:03.450> wheel<00:01:04.079> base<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:05.189> wider

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
size the wider wheel base the wider

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
size the wider wheel base the wider
trucks<00:01:05.820> both<00:01:06.810> boards<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> same<00:01:07.979> sized

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
trucks both boards have the same sized

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.260 
trucks both boards have the same sized
wheels<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> due<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:11.790> wider<00:01:11.970> wheel<00:01:12.240> base

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
wheels but due to the wider wheel base

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.899 
wheels but due to the wider wheel base
of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> nickel<00:01:13.230> it<00:01:13.800> functions<00:01:14.400> better<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of the nickel it functions better on

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.110 
of the nickel it functions better on
rough<00:01:15.570> surfaces<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.400> lot<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> times<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.000> guys

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
rough surfaces a lot of times you guys

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.880 
rough surfaces a lot of times you guys
will<00:01:18.300> find<00:01:18.420> yourself<00:01:18.780> riding<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.290> concrete

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
will find yourself riding on concrete

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.430 
will find yourself riding on concrete
surfaces<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.760> those<00:01:21.690> surfaces<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> lot

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
surfaces and those surfaces have a lot

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.260 
surfaces and those surfaces have a lot
of<00:01:22.560> joints<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.979> them<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.820> causes<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:24.150> lot

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of joints in them and that causes a lot

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.200 
of joints in them and that causes a lot
of<00:01:24.330> cracks<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.250> something<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of cracks and something that you can do

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
of cracks and something that you can do
to<00:01:27.990> help<00:01:28.290> yourself<00:01:28.440> when<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.159> rougher

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to help yourself when going over rougher

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
to help yourself when going over rougher
surfaces<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.270> cracks<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.870> use<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.830> kick<00:01:32.040> tail

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
surfaces or cracks is use the kick tail

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.539 
surfaces or cracks is use the kick tail
of<00:01:32.520> both<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.600> boards<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.340> usually<00:01:35.340> use<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
of both these boards I usually use the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
of both these boards I usually use the
kick<00:01:35.729> tail<00:01:35.940> when<00:01:36.540> I'm<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.870> over<00:01:36.990> cracks<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
kick tail when I'm going over cracks to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.649 
kick tail when I'm going over cracks to
lift<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.010> front<00:01:38.130> wheels<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.420> raises

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
lift up the front wheels and that raises

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
lift up the front wheels and that raises
them<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> allows<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.310> entire<00:01:41.520> board<00:01:41.940> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
them up and allows the entire board to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.390 
them up and allows the entire board to
roll<00:01:42.270> over<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> crack<00:01:42.960> smoother<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.250> that's

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
roll over the crack smoother so that's

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.920 
roll over the crack smoother so that's
just<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.670> tip<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.390> riding<00:01:45.570> over<00:01:45.900> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
just a little tip when riding over a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990 
just a little tip when riding over a
rougher<00:01:46.290> surfaces<00:01:46.740> alright<00:01:47.670> everyone<00:01:47.940> that's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
