00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
were attempting to figure out what would

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.539 
were attempting to figure out what would
be<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.269> best<00:02:31.510> way<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.709> animators<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
be the best way to get the animators to

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.400 
be the best way to get the animators to
understand<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.269> basic<00:02:34.780> movements<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.350> the

understand the basic movements of the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.530 
understand the basic movements of the
style<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.070> we<00:02:36.220> decided<00:02:36.579> that<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.180> best<00:02:37.209> way<00:02:37.450> of

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
style so we decided that the best way of

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.120 
style so we decided that the best way of
course<00:02:37.750> would<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.200> get<00:02:38.590> these<00:02:38.739> people<00:02:39.100> to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
course would be to get these people to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.520 
course would be to get these people to
actually<00:02:39.549> perform<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.690> movements
