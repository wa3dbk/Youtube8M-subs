so<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.520> I've<00:00:02.730> got<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:04.910> development<00:00:05.910> board

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
so now I've got this development board

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.330 
so now I've got this development board
from<00:00:06.569> hotmail<00:00:06.980> ously<00:00:07.980> SDK<00:00:08.820> 500<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.219> have<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
from hotmail ously SDK 500 and I have a

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.390 
from hotmail ously SDK 500 and I have a
chip<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.639> intend<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.030> use<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.400> pickup

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
chip that I intend to use for the pickup

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.529 
chip that I intend to use for the pickup
on<00:00:17.730> yer<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.359> 18<00:00:18.690> mega<00:00:18.960> 16<00:00:20.539> it's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
on yer this is an 18 mega 16 it's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.590 
on yer this is an 18 mega 16 it's
capable<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.170> running<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> 16

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
capable of running up to the 16

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.750 
capable of running up to the 16
megahertz<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> configured<00:00:26.279> right

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
megahertz I have it configured right

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.140 
megahertz I have it configured right
wingers<00:00:27.240> now<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.189> getting<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> use

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
wingers now so I'm just getting to use

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.870 
wingers now so I'm just getting to use
it<00:00:32.210> for<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.570> time<00:00:33.780> today<00:00:34.309> just<00:00:35.309> ported

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
it for the first time today just ported

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.030 
it for the first time today just ported
the<00:00:37.219> linky<00:00:38.219> project<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.079> modified<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the linky project that I'm modified for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
the linky project that I'm modified for
the<00:00:41.219> butterfly<00:00:43.250> as<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.030> much

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the butterfly as you can see it's much

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.990 
the butterfly as you can see it's much
easier<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.780> set<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.320> everything<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.550> got<00:00:47.820> on

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
easier to set up everything it's got on

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.920 
easier to set up everything it's got on
board<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> switches<00:00:50.510> makes<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.719> much

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
board let's and switches makes it much

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.150 
board let's and switches makes it much
easier<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.590> debug<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
easier to debug it's also got the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.039 
easier to debug it's also got the
onboard<00:01:02.930> rs-232<00:01:03.930> connectors<00:01:05.390> which<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.720> will

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
onboard rs-232 connectors which I will

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.920 
onboard rs-232 connectors which I will
use<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> drive<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:10.100> LCD

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
use to drive the LCD

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.350 
use to drive the LCD
displayed<00:01:12.930> which<00:01:13.490> probably<00:01:14.490> should<00:01:15.090> write

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
displayed which probably should write

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
displayed which probably should write
today<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.720> hopefully<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.440> make<00:01:16.800> some<00:01:16.980> tests

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
today so hopefully I can make some tests

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.260 
today so hopefully I can make some tests
on<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:22.800> next<00:01:23.100> step<00:01:23.370> is<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> make<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
on that so next step is to make the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.410 
on that so next step is to make the
traverse<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.860> octo<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> traverse<00:01:26.910> run<00:01:27.240> on

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
traverse the octo to traverse run on

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
traverse the octo to traverse run on
this<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.760> now<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:29.970> got<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> Traverse

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.180 

program<00:01:34.440> ported<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.510> st<00:01:37.310> k<00:01:38.310> 500<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
program ported to the st k 500 with the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.469 
program ported to the st k 500 with the
18<00:01:41.190> mega<00:01:41.400> 16<00:01:42.710> micro<00:01:43.710> controller<00:01:44.270> right<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.450> i

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
18 mega 16 micro controller right now i

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.260 
18 mega 16 micro controller right now i
have<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> hooked<00:01:46.080> up<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.270> integrated

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
have a hooked up for the integrated

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
have a hooked up for the integrated
switches<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> let's<00:01:49.580> i'm<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.820> show<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
switches and let's i'm going to show you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.180 
switches and let's i'm going to show you
that<00:01:51.150> before<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:52.229> connect<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
that before i actually connect it to the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.450 
that before i actually connect it to the
stepper<00:01:54.030> driver<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.400> can<00:01:56.550> see<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:59.160> is

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
stepper driver so as you can see this is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.660 
stepper driver so as you can see this is
the<00:02:03.590> driver<00:02:04.590> enable<00:02:05.750> let<00:02:06.979> when<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.429> on

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the driver enable let when this is on

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
the driver enable let when this is on
all<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:10.580> stepper<00:02:14.060> windings<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:16.020> which

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
all the stepper windings are on which

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.720 
all the stepper windings are on which
means<00:02:16.920> i<00:02:17.130> cannot<00:02:17.520> move<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.910> manually<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:20.489> is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
means i cannot move it manually this is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.930 
means i cannot move it manually this is
the<00:02:21.560> step<00:02:23.660> indicator<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.489> too<00:02:26.670> fast

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the step indicator it's going too fast

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
the step indicator it's going too fast
so<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.510> see<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> blinking<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.500> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
so you can see a blinking but it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.520 
so you can see a blinking but it
actually<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.310> blinking<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.350> that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
actually is blinking and this one that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.350 
actually is blinking and this one that
you<00:02:31.709> do<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.250> blinking<00:02:32.670> that's<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> direction

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
you do see blinking that's the direction

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.590 
you do see blinking that's the direction
change<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:35.430> also<00:02:36.620> added<00:02:37.620> code<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.180> this

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
change I also added code to make this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.940 
change I also added code to make this
switch<00:02:39.989> stop<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:42.000> also<00:02:42.390> turns<00:02:43.110> off<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
switch stop it also turns off all the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
switch stop it also turns off all the
winding<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.970> move<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.300> step

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
winding so that you can move the step

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
winding so that you can move the step
manually<00:02:46.080> this<00:02:47.070> which<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.720> go<00:02:48.720> re-enable<00:02:49.709> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
manually this which is go re-enable this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.040 
manually this which is go re-enable this
one<00:02:51.709> changes<00:02:52.709> direction<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.660> let's<00:02:54.840> turn<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
one changes direction so let's turn it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.640 
one changes direction so let's turn it
off

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.160 

take<00:02:59.650> off<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.340> lats<00:03:00.610> from<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.600> connect

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
take off the lats from here and connect

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:12.460 
take off the lats from here and connect
the<00:03:02.890> driver

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.970 

the<00:03:12.950> driver<00:03:13.280> pissed<00:03:13.820> on<00:03:14.210> right<00:03:14.540> now<00:03:17.710> let's<00:03:18.710> go

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the driver pissed on right now let's go

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.210 
the driver pissed on right now let's go
ahead

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.850 

take<00:03:23.150> another<00:03:23.450> angle<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.290> can<00:03:24.710> see

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
take another angle so you can see

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.430 
take another angle so you can see
everything<00:03:25.190> moving<00:03:25.930> okay<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:26.990> let's<00:03:27.290> go<00:03:27.410> ahead

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
everything moving okay so let's go ahead

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:50.180 
everything moving okay so let's go ahead
and<00:03:27.650> turn<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.070> on<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.700> see<00:03:32.650> what<00:03:33.650> happens
