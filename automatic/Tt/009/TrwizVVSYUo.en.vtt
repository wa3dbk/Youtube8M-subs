project manager for Trout Unlimited and

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.900 
project manager for Trout Unlimited and
we<00:00:15.730> are<00:00:15.820> on<00:00:15.970> the<00:00:16.120> Lemhi<00:00:16.620> River<00:00:17.910> particularly

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
we are on the Lemhi River particularly

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.580 
we are on the Lemhi River particularly
on<00:00:19.060> a<00:00:19.090> little<00:00:19.450> creek<00:00:19.660> called<00:00:19.930> little<00:00:20.230> Springs

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
on a little creek called little Springs

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.730 
on a little creek called little Springs
Creek<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:22.270> Lemhi<00:00:22.660> runs<00:00:22.930> into<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.320> Salmon

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
Creek the Lemhi runs into the Salmon

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.380 
Creek the Lemhi runs into the Salmon
River<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:24.190> Salmon<00:00:24.550> River<00:00:24.580> runs<00:00:24.970> into<00:00:25.240> the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
River the Salmon River runs into the

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.029 
River the Salmon River runs into the
snake<00:00:25.690> and<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:25.990> course<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.320> snake<00:00:26.560> goes<00:00:26.770> into

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
snake and of course the snake goes into

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.430 
snake and of course the snake goes into
the<00:00:27.160> Columbia<00:00:27.430> so<00:00:28.270> we're<00:00:28.449> on<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.780> very<00:00:29.020> upper

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
the Columbia so we're on the very upper

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.159 
the Columbia so we're on the very upper
watershed<00:00:29.830> of<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:31.180> Columbia<00:00:31.690> at<00:00:31.810> least<00:00:31.990> in

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
watershed of the Columbia at least in

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.880 
watershed of the Columbia at least in
Idaho<00:00:32.649> and<00:00:33.359> the<00:00:34.359> mountain<00:00:34.690> range<00:00:34.929> off<00:00:35.199> to<00:00:35.530> our

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
Idaho and the mountain range off to our

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.860 
Idaho and the mountain range off to our
East<00:00:36.219> is<00:00:36.579> actually<00:00:36.999> where<00:00:37.179> Lewis<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.600> Clark

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
East is actually where Lewis and Clark

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.700 
East is actually where Lewis and Clark
came<00:00:38.109> over<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.620> first<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:40.140> saw<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.199> waters

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
came over and first first saw the waters

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.719 
came over and first first saw the waters
of<00:00:41.859> the<00:00:41.949> Columbia<00:00:42.339> River

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
of the Columbia River

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.709 
of the Columbia River
so<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.659> Creek<00:00:44.019> was<00:00:44.260> heavily<00:00:44.589> impacted<00:00:45.719> from

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
so this Creek was heavily impacted from

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.770 
so this Creek was heavily impacted from
last<00:00:46.960> hundred<00:00:47.319> years<00:00:48.449> particularly<00:00:49.449> by

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
last hundred years particularly by

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.770 
last hundred years particularly by
cattle<00:00:50.379> grazing<00:00:50.649> and<00:00:51.549> we've<00:00:52.299> been<00:00:52.479> able<00:00:52.629> to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
cattle grazing and we've been able to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.719 
cattle grazing and we've been able to
work<00:00:52.870> with<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.260> couple<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.769> wonderful<00:00:53.979> ranchers

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
work with a couple of wonderful ranchers

very progressive forward-looking
ranchers<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:58.139> understand<00:00:59.139> the<00:00:59.350> value<00:00:59.769> of

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:00.209 
ranchers that understand the value of

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:03.649 
ranchers that understand the value of
wildlife<00:01:01.209> complexity<00:01:02.199> on<00:01:02.379> their<00:01:02.649> branches<00:01:03.249> so

wildlife complexity on their branches so

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.630 
wildlife complexity on their branches so

these cold water spring creeks are

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.639 
these cold water spring creeks are
really<00:01:10.090> valuable<00:01:10.570> for<00:01:10.840> salmon<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:11.560> steelhead

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
down the stream Bank we probably put 50

will<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.030> provide<00:02:43.840> stability<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.430> bank

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
will it provide stability for this bank

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.290 
will it provide stability for this bank
but<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.390> actually<00:02:46.690> shade<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.980> creek<00:02:48.280> give<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.210> a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
but I actually shade the creek give it a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.170 
but I actually shade the creek give it a
little<00:02:49.600> bit<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:50.130> shading<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.400> these<00:02:51.610> willows

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little bit of shading as these willows

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.020 
little bit of shading as these willows
grow<00:02:52.420> higher<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.680> our<00:02:54.100> point<00:02:54.430> bar<00:02:54.670> over<00:02:54.910> there

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
grow higher and our point bar over there

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.050 
grow higher and our point bar over there
is<00:02:55.150> working<00:02:55.510> exactly<00:02:55.720> where<00:02:56.350> flood<00:02:56.680> stage<00:02:57.060> for
