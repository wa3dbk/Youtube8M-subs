00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.260
 I'll tell you how it goes, because here are these 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.700
 tricks to improve your jce 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.190
 career technique and endurance is more 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.200
 time running first hold 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.710
 for 50 meters with climbs of 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.480
 knees 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 it is very important to have well placed the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.500
 pelvis and well aligned the arms and 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.690
 legs and a council to not die 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.250
 suffocated breathing well at the moment 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.380
 that you make the effort and so 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.300
 Marshes Calorie recommends you do 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.470
 three series of one minute with one minute 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.470
 Rest between each phase 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.590
 second career technical advice 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.390
 heels to the buttocks what are we going to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.330
 do is keep the top of the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.950
 firm and relaxed trunk the movie is being 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.290
 forward and we are going to contract the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.330
 abdominals the leg that is in the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.970
 soil is going to stay firm and the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.380
 second dynamic we will do three series of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.780
 one minute with a minute of rest 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.460
 between each phase I also recommend that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.320
 you run progressively I do not want to 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.390
 go out the first day and eat the world 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.220
 setting goals is fine but there are 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.430
 what to do with a head starts with 20 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.790
 minutes then 30 then 45 like that until a 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.140
 hour you can also fourth council the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.140
 hydration is super important 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.060
 moisturize but not in excess what you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.920
 recommend is that going a sip of 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 water between each recovery phase of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.150
 the race but never again then if you drink 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.459
 an average of two liters of water at 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.200
 long day of the fifth and last council is 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.790
 equally important to do a phase of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.890
 pre-race warm-up by 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.300
 example with a few minutes of yoga at 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.770
 just like doing a few minutes of 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
 recovery when we finish our 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.710
 running session for example walk 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.870
 towards home and leave 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.400
 a day of rest throughout the week 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.930
 especially for those who run 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.610
 every day so you will have in 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 new goals and the body recharges 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.040
 batteries and I'm going to run now 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.970
 good girls, these are the tips 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.440

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.630

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.660
 to know if you are real frogs 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.400
 is to go running accompanied and if 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760
 conversation at a time without asphyxiation is 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.710
 that you are prepared to do our 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.910

 and keep well aligned arms and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.670
 legs
