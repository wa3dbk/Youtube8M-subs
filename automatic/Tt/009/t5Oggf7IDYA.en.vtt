 I have nothing else to add except 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.420
 the description of the board itself in the case 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.869

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.450
 in from the voices to gout 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.090
 there is another manufacturer but this does not 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.149
 has problem that the board is the same as what 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:55.149
 matter is the bios of the abet chonÃ© she is a 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:58.090
 plate 164 with the wheel 20 and 412 megabytes 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.829
 quiet and or francis part 1 and 2 that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.880
 I already took the test here at home. 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.070
 brings 18 2 the battlefield vietnam vietnam 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.259
 every computer runs until the end of two 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.869
 years have not tried with modern warfare 3 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.480
 nor with a battery of 30 to take the test 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.600
 take the test and on the test a good plate 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.640
 only how to know nothing of the generation 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.540
 old and we will not force our plates 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.239
 Right? 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.680
 but the good card for you to win you 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.050
 You do not need to wear it, you can. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.400
 to win them by simply passing 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.070
 ahead for whoever is interested 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.040
 in buying your mona is a lot plate 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.830
 good as I said and also supports 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.710
 These games that I said do not heat up. 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 very quiet for those who have only one qat 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.510
 pci express if see is 2.0 that it works 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.790
 perfectly 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 It's a good sign when I said it and another 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.680
 thing about the draw who sign up 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.380
 and sign up for the draw 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.140
 re-analyze this on the day of the draw 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.760
 if you are randomly chosen, you have registered 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.710
 a new draw occurs 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.990
 after two days these are the criteria 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.060
 simple venus draw of the order of 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.840
 October there to have no problem 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.830
 in relation to that the network and things 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.260
 more right 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.200
 for all the competitors the island is 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.570

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.720

 our social network to're helping 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.030
 This is not going to be the criterion. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.950
 is to spread our social network to you 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 giving more people there 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.930
