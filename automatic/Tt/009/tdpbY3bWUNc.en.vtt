00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the same device you know find three

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
the same device you know find three
friends<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.280> need<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.670> copy

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
friends they don't need to have a copy

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.280 
friends they don't need to have a copy
the<00:00:36.000> game<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> copy<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> then

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the game you just use this copy and then

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
the game you just use this copy and then
you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.559> play<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> three<00:00:38.640> other

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you can play with up to three other

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
you can play with up to three other
people<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.480> course<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.750> could<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:39.960> race

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
people of course you could also race

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
people of course you could also race
against<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.530> computer<00:00:40.710> considering<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.520> don't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
against the computer considering I don't

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.869 
against the computer considering I don't
have<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.110> don't<00:00:43.860> even<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.489> other<00:00:44.640> friends

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
have I don't even have two other friends

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.229 
have I don't even have two other friends
let<00:00:45.180> alone<00:00:45.360> three<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.460> accelerate<00:00:48.030> by

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
let alone three so we accelerate by

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
let alone three so we accelerate by
tapping<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.809> corner<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.160> be

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
tapping our corner and you got to be

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
tapping our corner and you got to be
careful<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> accelerate<00:00:51.570> too<00:00:51.930> much<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.500> go

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
careful not to accelerate too much or go

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.959 
careful not to accelerate too much or go
too<00:00:52.920> fast<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
too fast because then you're going to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
too fast because then you're going to
wipe<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:55.340> here<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
wipe out here we go so this is one of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
wipe out here we go so this is one of
the<00:00:58.800> camera<00:00:59.100> angles<00:00:59.399> well<00:00:59.550> there<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> jump

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the camera angles well there to jump

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.110 
the camera angles well there to jump
there

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.770 

and<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.170> course<00:01:07.200> its<00:01:07.560> CPU<00:01:07.980> so<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.790> knows<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.480> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and of course its CPU so it knows how to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.110 
and of course its CPU so it knows how to
accelerate<00:01:10.140> perfectly<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
accelerate perfectly so this would be a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.480 
accelerate perfectly so this would be a
lot<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.450> fun<00:01:12.840> playing<00:01:13.530> against<00:01:14.040> friends

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
lot more fun playing against friends

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
lot more fun playing against friends
it's<00:01:15.390> also<00:01:15.600> difficult<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.350> angle<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's also difficult from this angle to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.690 
it's also difficult from this angle to
tell<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.640> straightaways<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:19.700> rather

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
tell what your straightaways are rather

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480 
tell what your straightaways are rather
than<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> curves<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:23.160> you'd<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
than where the curves are so you'd know

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.860 
than where the curves are so you'd know
when<00:01:23.760> and<00:01:24.120> where<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.570> accelerate<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.970> can

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
when and where to accelerate but I can

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.720 
when and where to accelerate but I can
tap<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.050> button<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.500> change<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.400> camera<00:01:29.610> angle

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
tap a button and change the camera angle

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.370 
tap a button and change the camera angle
so<00:01:30.120> now<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.510> to<00:01:30.660> be<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> trailing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
so now I'm going to be in the trailing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
so now I'm going to be in the trailing
mode<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.360> close<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.580> go

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mode it's a little close up there we go

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
mode it's a little close up there we go
now<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.480> action<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.990> guys

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
now we're right in the action you guys

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.850 
now we're right in the action you guys
getting<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> good<00:01:41.570> went<00:01:42.570> too<00:01:42.720> fast<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:43.470> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
getting that good went too fast okay so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.320 
getting that good went too fast okay so
let's<00:01:44.010> change<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> camera<00:01:44.640> angle<00:01:44.790> again<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.300> a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
let's change the camera angle again to a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.620 
let's change the camera angle again to a
fixed<00:01:45.870> mode<00:01:46.440> this<00:01:47.430> one's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.760> little<00:01:48.200> difficult

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
fixed mode this one's a little difficult

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.760 
fixed mode this one's a little difficult
well<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.690> least<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.320> mean<00:01:52.410> I'm<00:01:52.620> able

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
well at least I think so I mean I'm able

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.750 
well at least I think so I mean I'm able
to<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:52.980> the<00:01:53.100> whole<00:01:53.190> track<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> where

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
to see the whole track and where

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.050 
to see the whole track and where
everybody<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:55.400> but<00:01:56.400> at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.580> same<00:01:56.760> time<00:01:57.000> oh

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
everybody is but at the same time oh

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.430 
everybody is but at the same time oh
that's<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.510> but<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> definitely

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
that's see but then I can definitely

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.170 
that's see but then I can definitely
