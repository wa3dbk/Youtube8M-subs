that<00:02:15.380> increases<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> costs<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.310> over<00:02:16.610> what

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
that increases the costs of over what

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.470 
that increases the costs of over what
are<00:02:17.600> they<00:02:17.690> tarred<00:02:17.930> roads<00:02:18.550> ricci<00:02:19.550> resurfacing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
are they tarred roads ricci resurfacing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
are they tarred roads ricci resurfacing
and<00:02:20.630> building<00:02:21.470> are<00:02:21.920> kind<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.280> different

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and building are kind of different

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.850 
and building are kind of different
things<00:02:23.470> resurfacing<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.739> actually

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
things resurfacing you can actually

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.680 
things resurfacing you can actually
scrape<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:25.760> can<00:02:25.910> get<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.120> down<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.510> pretty

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
scrape it we can get it down in a pretty

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.180 
scrape it we can get it down in a pretty
quick<00:02:26.900> time<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:27.350> you're<00:02:27.500> building<00:02:27.860> you've

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
quick time when you're building you've

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.470 
quick time when you're building you've
got<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.430> put<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> drainage<00:02:29.000> you've<00:02:29.360> got

gotta have the lime and the balancing of
the<00:02:37.280> sandstone<00:02:37.730> all<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.120> got<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.540> on

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the sandstone all of that's got to go on

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
the sandstone all of that's got to go on
layer<00:02:39.290> upon<00:02:39.560> layer<00:02:39.620> upon<00:02:39.830> layer<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.489> can't
