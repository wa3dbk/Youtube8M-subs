but<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:17.880> chip<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> said<00:01:18.660> it's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but what do you think chip you said it's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.300 
but what do you think chip you said it's
no<00:01:18.960> different<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.590> team<00:01:19.800> playing<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
no different for your team playing it's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490 
no different for your team playing it's
a<00:01:20.340> number<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.790> team<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.509> computers<00:01:22.050> don't

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a number one team the computers don't

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
a number one team the computers don't
seem<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.190> Ducks<00:01:23.430> much<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:23.910> what

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
seem to like the Ducks much but what

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
seem to like the Ducks much but what
about<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> less<00:01:24.479> than<00:01:24.660> 5050<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.560> remaining

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
about it less than 5050 of remaining

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
about it less than 5050 of remaining
undefeated<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.880> guess<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.180> means<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
undefeated I guess that means the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.609 
undefeated I guess that means the
computers<00:01:27.840> respect<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> pac-10<00:01:30.380> yeah<00:01:31.380> they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
computers respect to pac-10 yeah they

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.469 
computers respect to pac-10 yeah they
must<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> thought<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.149> be<00:01:33.270> no

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
must but I thought there was gonna be no

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.570 
must but I thought there was gonna be no
math<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.990> morning<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.860> confused<00:01:35.130> with

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
math this morning so I'm confused with

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.680 
math this morning so I'm confused with
all<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.790> data<00:01:37.670> well<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.850> team<00:01:39.060> does<00:01:39.450> have

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
all these data well your team does have

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.779 
all these data well your team does have
the<00:01:39.869> showdown<00:01:40.229> against<00:01:40.770> USC<00:01:41.160> we<00:01:41.460> were<00:01:41.580> there<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
the showdown against USC we were there a

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.840 
the showdown against USC we were there a
year<00:01:42.060> ago<00:01:42.410> 613<00:01:43.410> yards<00:01:43.770> yeah<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.490> actually

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
year ago 613 yards yeah you actually

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330 
year ago 613 yards yeah you actually
took<00:01:45.270> mercy<00:01:45.539> on<00:01:45.930> us<00:01:46.110> see<00:01:46.440> took<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.039> neat<00:01:47.220> when
