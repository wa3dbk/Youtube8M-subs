00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 drager 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.430
 one and now i want you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 reception which is called addition 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 loops 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 left and right uplift in English this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 sounds of the neck that increase you che in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 English magazines on knitting very 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 such a technique is often encountered when 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.850
 description of knitting any mandri 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.470
 and so the addition of the loop right elevation 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.710
 it is performed on the left needle on the loop 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.309
 who are on the left spoke on 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 raise on the right needle into the wall of the loop 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.539
 located in the previous row and under 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 the loop that we intend to knit 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:00.680
 Here now here's the previous row 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.160
 raise this loop on the knitting needle and 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.530
 knit it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.500
 and then knit that loop which 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.979
 us is on knitting needles this way 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.259
 we have one loop 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.410
 why this why is called right 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.560
 lifting though we perform it on the left 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.869
 spoke and because we like here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.369
 assume that this is the main loop 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.539
 then it will add to us 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.170
 so here to the right side of the main 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:40.080
 branches 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.270
 knitting direction of the loop 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.130
 us added loop on here looks at 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 this side 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.109
 Please follow this 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.969
 belgium 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:56.539
 once again I want to show means so we 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.429
 raise the loop of the previous row 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.460
 under the loop which we are now 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:07.220
 going to knit here we raise it to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:12.720
 knitting needle and already from this we knit loops and 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:17.160
 knit further it is our right and raise 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 all loops now let's go to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.849
 left up 5 left in front of raising 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.829
 loop is performed on the right spoke here on 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.450
 this loop which is on the right 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:33.510
 spoke we have already knitted it now we 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.640
 raise the loop which is on the row 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:43.230
 below this one we lift this to the left 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.560
 knitting needle and knitting a loop from it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.599
 see here it is a branch added 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 loops it will go to the left 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:03:00.150
 the side is therefore called left raise 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.900
 and everything is logical once again showing us 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.139
 there was a noose 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.790
 we get to the point when we are in the description 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.250
 it is said 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.329
 adding 5 loops loop to raise left 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.750
 we knit a loop we knit a 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.970
 then we raise the loop which is 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.090
 previous row under this loop here 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.519
 very clear in my view now 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.150
 we are tying her too and here 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.579
 any added loops are obtained 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.329
 there are no holes without knitted linen 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.549
 see it is very convenient and I repeat 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.120
 very often found in descriptions in 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:43.730
 English magazines looking for you want 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.730
 tell how to do so 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:04:00.030
 so 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:03.510
 provide you with the right loop lifting we 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.870
 raise the loop which is on the row 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.130
 below under the loop which we are going now 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.970
 to dress her into the knitting needle and with it 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.060
 knotted with added loops of your 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.150
 tell them as usual knit a loop and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.919
 we remove it from the spokes like this 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:31.410
 us added loop now left 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.040
 elevation which we perform on the right 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.250
 spoke 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.850
 again we knit a loop just now 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.560
 she is with us 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:47.220
 we knit and now add a loop 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:57.960
 of the following of the underlying outfit 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:05:03.590
 loops here is an addition again 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.590
 I will show you clearly 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.680
 first about you knit our main 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:24.099
 loop and then pick a loop out 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.669
 the next row is dress on the left 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:31.300
 knitting needle and from it we already knit our 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:36.419
 added loops here is one loop with us 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:40.889
 It added the same right arm is raised 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.889
 just made left spokes 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:51.460
 putting on a needle we lift not a loop of 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:53.440
 underlying row and knit it loop 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:03.069
 and by the way you can knit purl 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:05.409
 if we need to add something if we 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.879
 you need to purse, we knit 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:14.310
 purl facial then facial of 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:17.919
 the main loop is also provyazyvaem like this 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.960
 this is called under addition and 5 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.960
 right and left uplift
