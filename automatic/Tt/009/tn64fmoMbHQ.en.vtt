I leave all the fluid in there I'm going
to<00:01:47.869> get<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.320> bath<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.579> ATF<00:01:50.270> which<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:50.630> don't<00:01:50.810> want

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
to get a bath in ATF which I don't want

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
to get a bath in ATF which I don't want
so<00:01:52.220> I'm<00:01:52.310> going<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.460> go<00:01:52.579> ahead<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.850> suction
