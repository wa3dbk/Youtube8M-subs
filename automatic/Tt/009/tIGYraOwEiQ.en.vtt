00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.389
 two minutes guys in my new one 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.190
 video today we're going to make a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.880
 miniature for youtube 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 then the measurements are 1,080 x 720 pixels 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.949
 now let's go to orange 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.710
 strong we say with the instrument 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.289
 bucket we fill our bottom then 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.460
 with a clearer reason 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.920
 unloading a special brush we will go 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.100
 to insert it precisely on our background 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 then we move on to the second step, that is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.899
 text entry 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.550
 I will insert miniature from tutorial 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 youtube thumbnail to this text 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.239
 we have to make changes that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.649
 as usual the trace and the nuance 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:03.600
 as a track I will use 3pt and black while 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.409
 as a nuance is the da da 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.240
 photoshop and from yellow to orange 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.659
 obviously change the font and the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 greatness as usual, the memory that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.880
 to make the two changes there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 trace and nuance just click 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.640
 or on fx at the bottom or on the right button 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640
 merger options 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.730
 once it seemed all right 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.660
 click ok in all windows 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:47.850
 now that we carry on our work 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.590
 an outline we say for ours 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.980
 thumbnail I created and I'll leave you that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.750
 in description the link from where you can 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.340
 save and here we put the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.780
 shade from yellow to orange in the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.290

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.530
