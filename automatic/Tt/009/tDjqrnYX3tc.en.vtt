00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the main intro chord you're going to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.189 
the main intro chord you're going to
have<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:26.310> pointer<00:00:26.730> finger<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.810> first

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
have your pointer finger on the first

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
fret of the sixth string your ring
finger<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> third<00:00:31.830> fret<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> fifth

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
finger on the third fret of the fifth

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350 
finger on the third fret of the fifth
string<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.640> probably<00:00:35.969> should<00:00:36.300> use

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
string you know it probably should use

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
string you know it probably should use
your<00:00:36.510> pinky<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> instead<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> then

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
your pinky for that instead and then

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
your pinky for that instead and then
your<00:00:38.430> ring<00:00:38.610> finger<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> third<00:00:39.570> fret<00:00:39.600> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
your ring finger on the third fret of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.430 
your ring finger on the third fret of
the<00:00:40.140> third<00:00:40.860> string<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.870> hard<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> know

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the third string it's hard to see I know

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.740 
the third string it's hard to see I know
it's<00:00:43.739> hard<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.070> people's<00:00:44.340> fingers<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it's hard to see people's fingers so

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's hard to see people's fingers so
basically<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:50.570> 303<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> pick<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
basically it's 303 so when you pick it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.369 
basically it's 303 so when you pick it
it's<00:00:57.149> gonna<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.780> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.540 

and<00:01:05.379> then<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.560> switch<00:01:05.680> over<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.190> just<00:01:06.400> move

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
and then you switch over you just move

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.100 
and then you switch over you just move
your<00:01:06.670> pinky<00:01:06.820> down<00:01:07.090> one<00:01:07.390> string<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.080> a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
your pinky down one string so it's on a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.320 
your pinky down one string so it's on a
fourth<00:01:08.320> string<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:09.460> bar<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.700> top<00:01:10.090> two

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
fourth string and you bar the top two

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.540 
fourth string and you bar the top two
strings<00:01:11.260> on<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.920> first<00:01:12.100> fret<00:01:12.370> with<00:01:12.520> your

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
strings on the first fret with your

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.530 
strings on the first fret with your
index<00:01:12.880> finger

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
index finger

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.420 
index finger
it's<00:01:14.110> basically<00:01:14.410> an<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.710> chord<00:01:14.920> except<00:01:15.220> for<00:01:15.370> I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
it's basically an a chord except for I

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's basically an a chord except for I
just<00:01:15.520> leave<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:15.880> bottom<00:01:16.120> two<00:01:16.240> strings<00:01:16.300> open

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
just leave the bottom two strings open

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.240 
just leave the bottom two strings open
because<00:01:17.470> I'm<00:01:17.560> not<00:01:17.650> gonna<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.860> playing<00:01:18.100> them

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
because I'm not gonna be playing them

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.310 
because I'm not gonna be playing them
anyway<00:01:18.630> makes<00:01:19.630> for<00:01:19.750> an<00:01:19.840> easier<00:01:20.080> transition

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
anyway makes for an easier transition

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.170 
anyway makes for an easier transition
and<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.520> same<00:01:21.670> exact<00:01:21.880> picking

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
and you do the same exact picking

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.900 
and you do the same exact picking
pattern

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.280 

so<00:01:29.910> that's<00:01:30.330> how<00:01:30.480> you<00:01:30.540> put<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.870> intro<00:01:31.080> in<00:01:31.230> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
so that's how you put the intro in the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
so that's how you put the intro in the
verse<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.820> need<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> chorus

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
verse and then we need to the chorus

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.620 
verse and then we need to the chorus
it's<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.230> to<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> bar

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
it's going to you're going to go and bar

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.850 
it's going to you're going to go and bar
the<00:01:36.630> third<00:01:36.930> fret<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.410> your<00:01:37.440> index<00:01:37.560> finger

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the third fret with your index finger

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
the third fret with your index finger
and<00:01:38.580> then<00:01:39.000> you're<00:01:39.090> basically<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> make

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and then you're basically going to make

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
and then you're basically going to make
AC<00:01:39.960> chord<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:40.860> make<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> C<00:01:41.310> chord<00:01:41.460> down

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
AC chord how you make a C chord down

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.470 
AC chord how you make a C chord down
here<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.200> make<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> C<00:01:43.740> chord<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.160> here

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
here you just make a C chord right here

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.450 
here you just make a C chord right here
but<00:01:45.480> you<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.440> basically<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.980> bar<00:01:47.160> third

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but you use the basically the bar third

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.170 
but you use the basically the bar third
fret<00:01:47.730> as<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:49.470> end<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.800> your<00:01:49.890> guitar<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
fret as the end of your guitar so I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.000 
fret as the end of your guitar so I
believe<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.110> sure<00:01:52.290> record<00:01:52.620> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> it's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
believe I'm not sure record this is it's

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.320 
believe I'm not sure record this is it's
some<00:01:53.190> sort<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:54.890> something<00:01:55.890> whatever<00:01:56.580> they're

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
some sort of something whatever they're

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
some sort of something whatever they're

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
four chords so the first one is going to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.760 
four chords so the first one is going to
be<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.320> regular<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:07.110> then<00:05:07.830> down<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.220> a

coming back up to the C bar again and

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.870 
coming back up to the C bar again and
then<00:05:16.800> you're<00:05:16.890> gonna<00:05:16.980> go<00:05:17.160> down<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.580> use<00:05:17.670> that
