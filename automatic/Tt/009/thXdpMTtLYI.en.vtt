00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.510 
now on to mask and Hydra they are pretty
much<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> exact<00:01:50.880> same<00:01:50.909> thicker<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> um

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
much the exact same thicker with a um

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.109 
much the exact same thicker with a um
tweaked<00:01:53.520> head<00:01:53.820> sculpt<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.600> mask<00:01:55.729> or<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> guess

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
tweaked head sculpt on mask or I guess

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.310 
tweaked head sculpt on mask or I guess
the<00:01:57.149> tweaked<00:01:57.479> head<00:01:57.600> sculpt<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> Hydra

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the tweaked head sculpt of Hydra

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
the tweaked head sculpt of Hydra
depending<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.979> which<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.460> looking<00:01:59.939> at

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
depending on which one you're looking at

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.959 
depending on which one you're looking at
of<00:02:01.020> course<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.770> nice<00:02:02.430> detail<00:02:02.820> really

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
of course I'm very nice detail really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.399 
of course I'm very nice detail really
surprised<00:02:03.390> they<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> paint<00:02:03.960> lines<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
surprised they got the paint lines so

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.100 
surprised they got the paint lines so
clearer<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> edges<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.369> her<00:02:05.430> mask<00:02:06.110> over

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
clearer in the edges of her mask over

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.300 
clearer in the edges of her mask over
here<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.740> did<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.069> great<00:02:08.280> job

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
here I think they really did a great job

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
here I think they really did a great job
um<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.030> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> green<00:02:09.869> shading

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
um you can see kind of the green shading

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.890 
um you can see kind of the green shading
on<00:02:10.500> her<00:02:10.590> eyes<00:02:10.739> they're<00:02:11.330> really<00:02:12.330> nice<00:02:12.480> bright

agent gun I think they just sculpted a
stake<00:02:59.830> in<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.069> end<00:03:00.220> of<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.519> so<00:03:00.989> you<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.080> I

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110

more original weapons you know for each

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.220 
more original weapons you know for each
character<00:03:06.700> but<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.959> end<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.110> the

world<00:03:08.380> with<00:03:08.470> these<00:03:08.560> um<00:03:08.940> now<00:03:09.940> seeing<00:03:10.180> as<00:03:10.269> their

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
world with these um now seeing as their

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.199 
world with these um now seeing as their
articulation<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.200> exactly<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.830> same<00:03:12.209> we'll

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209

these<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.799> pre<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:04.720> adequate<00:04:05.079> but<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.500> once

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
these is a pre it's adequate but it once

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.349 
these is a pre it's adequate but it once
again<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:05.980> kind<00:04:06.130> of<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.250> base<00:04:06.579> line<00:04:07.239> of

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
again it's kind of a base line of

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.670 
again it's kind of a base line of
articulation<00:04:07.989> that<00:04:08.079> we<00:04:08.200> were<00:04:08.290> getting<00:04:08.530> in<00:04:08.620> the

articulation that we were getting in the
two<00:04:08.829> pipes<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:10.810> hoping<00:04:11.109> with<00:04:11.290> this

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
two pipes and I was hoping with this

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.809 
two pipes and I was hoping with this
line<00:04:11.709> would<00:04:11.889> be<00:04:11.920> stepping<00:04:12.310> up<00:04:12.549> from<00:04:12.700> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
line would be stepping up from the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.009 
line would be stepping up from the
previous<00:04:13.060> quality<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.660> don't<00:04:13.840> get<00:04:13.930> me<00:04:13.989> wrong

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
previous quality I don't get me wrong

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.840 
previous quality I don't get me wrong
