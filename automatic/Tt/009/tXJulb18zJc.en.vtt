00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello friends look what i have 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.130
 growing knew it growing growing cucumbers and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.969
 grow not just us on the ground grow here 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.199
 to reach out 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 such a grid is also called a trellis 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:22.640
 it means a very convenient way of growing 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 That means such a collapsible design 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 primitive here is the pipe here is this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.349
 removed 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.180
 this is temporary for structural stiffness 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.370
 mean several advantages 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.379
 growing like smallpox growing such 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.340
 in the first place 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.629
 convenient to collect from martia second takes 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.180
 very few places are easy to water 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.199
 you have 110 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 a channel is made to and so that water is not 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.460
 fell on the leaves of cucumbers 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.280
 right here water is poured into the groove so 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 if here and me down the slope there 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 watered here runs on preferably 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 pour cold water and pre 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.180
 let the barrels stand the night heats up 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.180
 see stumble on the sly 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 here they all work for us 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:34.850
 conveniently tied little 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 here autumn is then removed 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.440
 the design is completely disassembled 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:47.820
 and here remains pure rarely here 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:52.770
 screwed 1 so grown already 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.220
 not the first year I was not the first year but decided 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.620
 make a video to show you if something is netak 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.880
 write in the comments put likes 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:08.300
 subscribe to my channel will be many 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.300
 video thank you all all the best
