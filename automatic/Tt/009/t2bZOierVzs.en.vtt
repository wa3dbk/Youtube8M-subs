many<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.899> us<00:00:03.990> have<00:00:04.200> seen<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.830> interest<00:00:05.309> rates

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
many of us have seen how interest rates

further reductions of interests are

Commerce and we have to reduce interest

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.960 
Commerce and we have to reduce interest
rates<00:03:37.799> yet<00:03:38.280> again<00:03:39.019> as<00:03:40.019> we<00:03:40.379> see<00:03:40.590> here<00:03:41.040> again

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
multiplying sum of debt again encroaches

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.330

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.099

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
and so the remaining limping industry

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.780 
and so the remaining limping industry
expires<00:03:58.109> under<00:03:58.590> deprivation<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.609> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
so again we must reduce the overall rate

of the terminal phase this lower rate of

sum of debt or gradually encroach upon

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.860 
sum of debt or gradually encroach upon
industry<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.630> let's<00:04:54.840> move<00:04:55.080> on<00:04:55.320> now<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.680> year<00:04:56.190> 16

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
rate of encroachment has been moderated

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.790 
rate of encroachment has been moderated
the<00:05:08.669> effect<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.180> which<00:05:09.389> of<00:05:09.570> course<00:05:09.599> is<00:05:10.289> to

the effect of which of course is to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
possession in year 17 we see the costs

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.550 
possession in year 17 we see the costs
of<00:05:19.490> servicing<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.240> multiplying<00:05:20.870> sum<00:05:21.200> of<00:05:21.350> debt

have reduced the liquid circulation from

have reduced the liquid circulation from
the<00:05:24.530> four<00:05:24.770> units<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.340> year<00:05:25.550> 16<00:05:26.150> to<00:05:26.810> one<00:05:27.020> unit

and so in your 18 as we would expect

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.020 
and so in your 18 as we would expect
