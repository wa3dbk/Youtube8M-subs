00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 he had prepared himself today 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.969
 along with the recipe he found on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.100
 internet that intrigued me a lot and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.400
 that is, cookies with hard-boiled eggs o 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.960
 better with the firm yolks in the dough 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 here they are really delicious 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.040
 I hope you will find that you will be me 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.969
 know if you want to see the 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 ingredients proceeding from one of the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:47.789
 be prepared that you stay here after dinner vi 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.910
 serve 150 g of 00 flour and 200 grams 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.059
 of cornstarch or potato starch that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 I've already put together a 150 bowl 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.940
 g of butter 100 g of icing sugar 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.149
 3 eggs 1 we will only use 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 the yolks after we will see a sachet of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 vanillin and powdered sugar for 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.330
 dust off cookies at the end then 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 bring to a boil in a saucepan 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.960
 of water and now let's go to break 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.970
 the egg to separate the shift from the album 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.729
 and now let's see then the album and it is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.920
 we put it here on one side and it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 used to make meringues la 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.790
 you find the recipe on the channel or others 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.790
 sweets in short 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.799
 and put the yolk gently 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:44.530
 in the boiling water and do so too 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:47.259
 for the other eggs after 57 minutes 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.729
 you see that the days are cooked you must 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:02:01.569
 feel that they are not too soft 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:03.459
 mix well and set aside could 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.159
 also make normal boiled eggs and then 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.079
 obtain the yolk at least at least 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.030
 after yolk made the call call 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.980
 that is, with the album it is cooked instead like this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.310
 you have the egg white and raw and you do that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.310
 what do you think? 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:26.370
 here now you crush the egg yolks for 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.370
 well although I recommend it 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.490
 ok so reduce the yolks so i 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.200
 courtyards since then 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.600
 so now with jammo in a bowl 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.640
 the flour with starch is wider 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.640
 slice the icing sugar 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:09.690
 the vanillin the butter in small pieces 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.910
 so if maybe it's not really cold of 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.920
 fridge is better because if softer then 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:21.540
 pull out dime from before and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 we also add the egg yolks a little 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.390
 money and now let's set up 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.120
 simply everything until you get it 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.120
 a nice homogeneous compound 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:50.459
 here's how it looks good 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.280
 soft the dough we now supply 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.049
 in fact we turn a ball into the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.150
 transparent film and the goal with 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.750
 fridge to rest for half an hour then 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.750
 see you later 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.709
 ok 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.640
 half an hour goes by I express ours 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.919
 dough and begin to make a 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.419
 get balls first 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.470
 lit the oven at 180 degrees 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.300
 so it frees itself and heats up and makes some 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.139
 balls allow all a baking sheet 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.380
 covered with parchment paper which of course 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.800
 continue like this until you finish all 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.729
 equal 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.729
 all the dough 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.530
 here's are now 26 biscuits 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.940
 we bake an oven preheated to 180 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.940
 degrees for about a quarter of an hour 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.280
 ok or baked cookies are still 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.310
 hot and then I'll talk over it 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.720
 icing sugar when they are seen 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.910
 then this as the first time that 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.010
 I was doing this video 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.510
 I found the recipe I don't remember on 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.680
 I write it somewhere 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.320
 still where to taste then if 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.260
 see this video you are good 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.550
 obviously if not no 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.099
 ok i hope you enjoyed the recent one 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.930
 to know whether to provide it 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.169
 meanwhile they send me back to 300 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.169
 people 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.410

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.810
 assiduous visitor of my group 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.070

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.440
