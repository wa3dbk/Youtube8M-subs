00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
and get hit again it will be just as

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.570 
and get hit again it will be just as

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.300 

yeah<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.640> bet<00:03:03.910> they<00:03:04.060> thought<00:03:04.330> they<00:03:04.510> were<00:03:04.570> clever

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
yeah I bet they thought they were clever

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.950 
yeah I bet they thought they were clever
overall<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.850> game<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.450> feels

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
overall this game it just feels

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.260 
overall this game it just feels
unfinished<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.370> really<00:03:09.760> mean<00:03:10.000> is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
unfinished and what I really mean is

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.930 
unfinished and what I really mean is
that<00:03:10.330> it's<00:03:10.960> like<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.410> was<00:03:11.530> barely<00:03:11.890> started<00:03:12.760> at

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that it's like it was barely started at

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.240 
that it's like it was barely started at
all<00:03:13.210> I<00:03:13.570> thought<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.290> was<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> prototype<00:03:14.890> of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
all I thought this was a prototype of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.000 
all I thought this was a prototype of
some<00:03:15.640> sort<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.450> an<00:03:16.630> actual<00:03:17.140> finished<00:03:17.680> game

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
some sort not an actual finished game

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
that got released in stores it's a pile

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.800 
that got released in stores it's a pile
of<00:03:21.250> junk<00:03:23.340> most<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.490> the<00:03:24.550> games<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.030> own<00:03:25.210> are<00:03:25.450> junk

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
of junk most of the games I own are junk
