00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.359
 one of the actions for the world's forests to be destroyed so 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.899
 quickly you see here in Brazil I search for coladeira 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.739
 but who said that way saldanha 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.149
 Have you ever heard of woods? 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.529
 but the product looks like one of them 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.820
 can be a thing of woods 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.840
 buildings 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.050
 screws 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.910
 but that in fact the goalkeeper of the adepol the keys formally discarded as 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.020
 trash 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 in today's program you will see how plastic wood gains prestige in the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 space in the market 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.800
 in belo horizonte a factory uses 100% national technology 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 to turn waste into battery 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.749
 the federal government 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.989
 five hundred tons of snow 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.930
 the tons of criminal matters 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.940
 this date so far 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.430
 everything is harnessed 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 every 7 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580
 in the last decade 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.740
 an adult tree 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.320
 this is my house 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.860
 we must beat the country that pollutes the most 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.410
 the mid-market with plastics is also the world's largest market for mumps 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.610
 plastic 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.020
 the war correspondent esg 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.060
 visited a factory in california 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.620
 to make a game like this 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.890
 five hundred bottles like this one are needed. 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 tons of waste are brought 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.580
 in the kitchen there were 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.650
 14 thousand visitors 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.479
 Plastic bags have everything from collecting these materials 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.330
 it's just the first step 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.270
 for garbage processing in an amazing are released 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.909
 This is not about recycling. 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:31.040
 of industrial residues are residential in naviraí to biosintética 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.899
 with what to do 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.689
 we get we received these wastes from various sources 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.200
 amongst them 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.270
 the collectors of the industries that make partnerships with us 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.269
 in recent years materials in hospitals years 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.979
 we take 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.979
 I turned financial view 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.059
 created to solve 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.649
 lnet the ton of sugarcane ends do not lose or be in practice 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
 everything is harnessed 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.359
 the last defeat defined 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.359
 the adult tree is preserved 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.370
 walking through the factory we know every step of the process 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.069
 but they are sins 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.339
 the preparation is important to facilitate the fact that gui 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.259
 these scores and into the goal 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.569
 that stuff and it's like a cake recipe 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.510
 but here the ingredients are being processed from plastic and another to the center 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.979
 in 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.979
 among the natives of africa 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.009
 the assembly of this process 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.179
 I did not need 15 clubs and now 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.460
 with the with one with this process we avoid contamination byproducts 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.690
 Finally, all the harm is in order and are present in the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 municipality but rather as 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.139
 W 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.909
 during the study the investments are being lived by the rooster 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 the result looks like bran 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.139
 is the truth is that the older had been skeptical in the next stage the material 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.229
 is heated to an even higher temperature by 300 degrees within that machine. 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.700
 kill to be distributed in flip format so that there are three more alternatives 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.580
 ansa 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.180
 the advantage 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.580
 she 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.009
 It's very big 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.830
 one of them is that it is a waterproof material 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.830
 this characteristic makes it obligatory for those who do not remember anything 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.840
 I have my stuff that is not it that is not easy 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.949
 not 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.419
 to agás 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.460
 the other patricinha 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.250
 she can stand the time being ready to be put on time without having to 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.530
 maintenance - it would be estimated that exposed to time this wood has a 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.959
 expected durability of approximately 100 years 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.270
 Saturday afternoon near to end my life 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.699
 it's a strong signal 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.699
 for it to be yet natural 'or Florida 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:35.830
 on here 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.370
 true woods 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.419
 is here 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.379
 the synthetic way of it 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.300
 Difficult to perceive the difference this way 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300
 the natural way is the worker 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.100
 what is most striking is the texture 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.410
 everything very similar to the material that wants to return to the elite worked life 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.659
 entire 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.519
 that day I did not imagine that at 79 years of having suffered a crisis with 

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:06.889
 a barrier made of plastic at the end of the month 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.889
 without the felling of any tree 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.960
 I accepted something complicated reuters rtp 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.520
 helena lives these inheritance 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.710
 to work a much more soldier thing than bob hurley as because it is 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.490
 a damn purity 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.589
 Rene was in the north but I think little 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.149
 main is the oscar is open and that nature is made 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.659
 conservative 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.449
 and then we work with material on the ladder it moved because if I 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.009
 was younger 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.470
 I was going to make a house of these only the content of the legal motorcycle action in that country 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.039
 the same in architecture 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.710
 but today the wood 'teak graphite is used in the manufacture of a 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.580
 infinite
