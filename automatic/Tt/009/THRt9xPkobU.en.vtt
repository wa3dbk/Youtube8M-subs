trying a place where we have we have a

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.719 
trying a place where we have we have a
spawning<00:01:08.290> stream<00:01:08.590> close<00:01:08.860> by<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.490> have

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
spawning stream close by and you have

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.480 
spawning stream close by and you have
some<00:01:09.940> larger<00:01:10.390> depths<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.950> close<00:01:12.190> by<00:01:12.430> -

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
some larger depths pretty close by -

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.880 
some larger depths pretty close by -
okay<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.300> also<00:01:13.510> we<00:01:13.690> have<00:01:13.810> some<00:01:14.020> wind<00:01:14.229> yeah<00:01:14.680> we

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
okay and also we have some wind yeah we

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.950 
okay and also we have some wind yeah we
have<00:01:15.010> been<00:01:15.460> a<00:01:15.490> wind<00:01:15.729> coming<00:01:16.030> towards<00:01:16.630> us<00:01:16.750> here

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
have been a wind coming towards us here

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.530 
have been a wind coming towards us here
so<00:01:17.170> we're<00:01:17.710> trying<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.130> see<00:01:18.970> what<00:01:19.120> we<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.330> do<00:01:19.450> if

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
so we're trying to see what we can do if

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.850 
so we're trying to see what we can do if
we<00:01:19.600> can<00:01:19.720> find<00:01:19.870> some<00:01:20.110> fish<00:01:20.290> in<00:01:20.500> these

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
we can find some fish in these

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.500 
we can find some fish in these
conditions<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:21.460> they're<00:01:21.640> not<00:01:21.760> very<00:01:22.030> close<00:01:22.299> and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
conditions so they're not very close and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.000 
conditions so they're not very close and
getting<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.810> suntan<00:01:23.020> at<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.380> moment<00:01:23.680> probably

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
getting a suntan at the moment probably

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.680 
getting a suntan at the moment probably
not<00:01:24.400> okay<00:01:24.549> okay

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690

future dream today we're fishing sea

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.940 
future dream today we're fishing sea
trout<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> there's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> Sun<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.950> we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
trout and there's a lot of Sun and we

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
trout and there's a lot of Sun and we
are<00:01:41.190> targeting<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.390> areas<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.869> dark<00:01:43.110> bottom

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
are targeting the areas with dark bottom

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.700 
are targeting the areas with dark bottom
I<00:01:43.680> fish<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.750> rather<00:01:45.750> heavy<00:01:46.110> flies<00:01:46.410> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I fish with rather heavy flies and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.650 
I fish with rather heavy flies and
there's<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.400> lot<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> movement<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.300> lot<00:01:48.540> of

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
there's a lot of movement in in a lot of

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.630 
there's a lot of movement in in a lot of
jigging<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.530> really<00:01:49.740> effective<00:01:50.160> now<00:01:50.340> when

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
jigging it's really effective now when

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240 
jigging it's really effective now when
the<00:01:50.729> water<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.450> warmer<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.470> I'm

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the water is a little bit warmer so I'm

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.890 
the water is a little bit warmer so I'm
going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.750> find

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
going to go out here see if we can find

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.760 
going to go out here see if we can find
something<00:01:56.810> when<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.930> fish<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.290> flies<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
something when you fish these flies that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
something when you fish these flies that
are<00:01:58.920> very<00:01:59.100> heavily<00:01:59.340> weighted<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.690> very

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
are very heavily weighted it's very

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.469 
are very heavily weighted it's very
important<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.440> you<00:02:01.530> make<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> loop<00:02:01.979> knot<00:02:02.479> so

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
important that you make a loop knot so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.290 
important that you make a loop knot so
they<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> swim<00:02:04.080> freely<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:05.340> would<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.640> much

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
they can swim freely it would get much

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.070 
they can swim freely it would get much
better<00:02:06.509> movement<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> lot

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
better movement and you will have a lot

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.210 
better movement and you will have a lot
more<00:02:10.289> fish<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.649> them<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.980> made<00:02:14.190> a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
more fish on them you know if you made a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.390 
more fish on them you know if you made a
rot<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.090> correctly<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:16.470> line<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.250> beam

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
rot the not correctly the line will beam

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.660 
rot the not correctly the line will beam
from<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.300> 90<00:02:18.540> degrees<00:02:18.930> angle<00:02:18.959> from<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.010> tippet

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
from a 90 degrees angle from the tippet

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.550 
from a 90 degrees angle from the tippet
material<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:21.900> they<00:02:22.019> have<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.290> loop

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
material and then they have this loop

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.670 
material and then they have this loop
knot<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.010> they<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.370> drop<00:02:23.700> straight<00:02:24.060> down<00:02:27.680> so

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
knot and they can drop straight down so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.210 
knot and they can drop straight down so
guide<00:02:29.130> now<00:02:30.410> Robert<00:02:31.410> he<00:02:31.560> went<00:02:31.739> off<00:02:31.890> for<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
guide now Robert he went off for the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
guide now Robert he went off for the
cliff<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.269> bit<00:02:33.390> deeper<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
cliff that's a little bit deeper on the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.199 
cliff that's a little bit deeper on the
other<00:02:34.019> side<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.700> think<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.000> was<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
other side there and I think it was the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.979 
other side there and I think it was the
first<00:02:36.450> cast<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.049> he<00:02:37.610> hooked<00:02:38.610> into<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.030> fish

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
first cast and he hooked into a fish

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.069 
first cast and he hooked into a fish
I<00:02:40.019> think<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.590> fishing<00:02:40.769> these<00:02:40.980> jiggy<00:02:41.640> flies

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
I think it's fishing these jiggy flies

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.000 
I think it's fishing these jiggy flies
so<00:02:43.079> we're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:43.530> over<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:43.920> take

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
so we're going to go over there and take

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.830 
so we're going to go over there and take
a<00:02:44.070> look<00:02:44.180> did<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> nice<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:46.910> good<00:02:47.910> job

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.110 

so<00:02:51.840> what<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.700> gospel<00:02:53.910> on

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
so what we have is a it's a gospel on

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.400 
so what we have is a it's a gospel on
fish<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.660> local<00:02:54.990> fish

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
fish it's a local fish

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.100 
fish it's a local fish
it<00:02:55.470> probably<00:02:55.830> spawned<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.870> river

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
it probably spawned here in this river

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.340 
it probably spawned here in this river
last<00:02:58.470> last<00:02:59.190> fall<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.050> see<00:03:01.200> it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
last last fall and you can see it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.550 
last last fall and you can see it's
clearly<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.920> sonogram<00:03:02.640> fish<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.420> CC<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680 
clearly a sonogram fish but CC it's a
nice<00:03:04.770> condition<00:03:05.250> super<00:03:05.550> good<00:03:05.700> condition<00:03:06.210> yeah

fishing these areas that are a little
bit<00:03:53.070> easier<00:03:53.460> for<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.700> fish<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.030> access<00:03:54.480> to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
bit easier for the fish to access to

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.290
