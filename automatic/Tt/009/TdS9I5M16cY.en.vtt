people because you know it takes a while
it<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.740> took<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> couple<00:01:11.760> tries<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> do

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it actually took me a couple tries to do

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
it actually took me a couple tries to do
it<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.570> once<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> down<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it but once you get it down it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
it but once you get it down it's
actually<00:01:14.130> pretty<00:01:14.580> easy<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.020> that's

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
actually pretty easy to do so that's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
actually pretty easy to do so that's
