00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
a high milk production

a high milk production
this<00:04:38.729> along<00:04:39.180> with<00:04:39.240> controls<00:04:39.780> for

this along with controls for
environmental<00:04:40.530> factors<00:04:40.950> has<00:04:41.430> transformed

environmental factors has transformed

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.760 
environmental factors has transformed
the<00:04:42.090> dairy<00:04:42.300> industry<00:04:42.360> because<00:04:43.110> cows<00:04:43.410> produce

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
the dairy industry because cows produce

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.960 
the dairy industry because cows produce
more<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.220> better<00:04:44.370> milk

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
more and better milk

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.760 
more and better milk
so<00:04:45.210> now<00:04:45.330> farmers<00:04:45.720> need<00:04:45.960> fewer<00:04:46.229> cows<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
so now farmers need fewer cows to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.610 
so now farmers need fewer cows to
achieve<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.250> same<00:04:47.430> production<00:04:48.470> genetics<00:04:49.470> and

achieve the same production genetics and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.290 
achieve the same production genetics and
