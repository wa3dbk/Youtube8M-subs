00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
diversify now there are a couple of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.999 
diversify now there are a couple of
things<00:01:13.520> here<00:01:13.670> going<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.929> light<00:01:15.350> levels

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
things here going on the light levels

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.279 
things here going on the light levels
are<00:01:16.280> incredibly<00:01:16.970> different<00:01:17.209> from<00:01:17.630> outside<00:01:18.110> to

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
are incredibly different from outside to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.350 
are incredibly different from outside to
inside<00:01:18.410> that's<00:01:18.830> where<00:01:19.039> HDR<00:01:19.700> photography<00:01:19.880> is

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
inside that's where HDR photography is

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.090 
inside that's where HDR photography is
going<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:20.569> come<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:20.840> as<00:01:21.229> photographers<00:01:21.950> we

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
going to come in so as photographers we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.529 
going to come in so as photographers we
really<00:01:22.399> have<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.700> learn<00:01:22.910> how<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.179> see<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
really have to learn how to see the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.359 
really have to learn how to see the
light<00:01:23.690> you<00:01:24.110> know<00:01:24.380> our<00:01:24.590> eyes<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:25.190> see<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
light you know our eyes can see a

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.520 
light you know our eyes can see a
dynamic<00:01:25.970> range<00:01:26.149> of<00:01:26.360> about<00:01:26.599> 11<00:01:26.990> F<00:01:27.140> stops<00:01:27.380> this

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
dynamic range of about 11 F stops this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.040 
dynamic range of about 11 F stops this
is<00:01:27.590> amazing<00:01:28.340> digital<00:01:29.000> cameras<00:01:29.509> even<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.840> best

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
is amazing digital cameras even the best

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.930 
is amazing digital cameras even the best
digital<00:01:30.229> camera<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.860> planet<00:01:31.310> can<00:01:31.759> only

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
digital camera on the planet can only

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.089 
digital camera on the planet can only
see<00:01:32.209> about<00:01:32.240> five<00:01:32.720> or<00:01:32.929> six<00:01:33.110> F<00:01:33.349> stuff<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.920> is

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
see about five or six F stuff so this is

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.790 
see about five or six F stuff so this is
again<00:01:34.490> where<00:01:34.940> HDR<00:01:35.509> photography<00:01:35.630> comes<00:01:36.289> in<00:01:36.440> so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
again where HDR photography comes in so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800 
again where HDR photography comes in so
we<00:01:36.979> have<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.369> learn<00:01:37.550> how<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.789> see<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.090> light<00:01:38.240> we

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
we have to learn how to see the light we

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.240 
we have to learn how to see the light we
also<00:01:39.020> have<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.380> learn<00:01:39.530> how<00:01:39.649> to<00:01:39.679> see<00:01:39.950> color

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
also have to learn how to see color

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.330 
also have to learn how to see color
everyone<00:01:40.910> sees<00:01:41.179> color<00:01:41.539> differently<00:01:42.349> and<00:01:42.649> I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
everyone sees color differently and I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.980 
everyone sees color differently and I
see<00:01:43.700> color<00:01:43.940> differently<00:01:44.390> than<00:01:44.630> other<00:01:44.869> people

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
see color differently than other people

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.540 
see color differently than other people
we<00:01:45.410> see<00:01:45.590> colors<00:01:45.920> differently<00:01:46.399> at<00:01:46.520> different

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
we see colors differently at different

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.089 
we see colors differently at different
times<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.149> day<00:01:47.209> believe<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.229> or<00:01:48.349> not<00:01:48.500> after<00:01:48.979> we

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
times of day believe it or not after we

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:50.620 
times of day believe it or not after we

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
drink coffee we see colors differently

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.979

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the entire dynamic range so when I go

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.090 
the entire dynamic range so when I go
