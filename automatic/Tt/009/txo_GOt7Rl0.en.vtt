00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.739 
guys that have internalized it
especially<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.639> returners<00:01:08.149> they<00:01:08.359> know<00:01:08.539> it

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
especially the returners they know it

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.639 
especially the returners they know it
they<00:01:08.929> get<00:01:09.469> it<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.880> then<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.420> new<00:01:11.600> guys<00:01:11.840> have

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
they get it and then the new guys have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.379 
they get it and then the new guys have
done<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> great<00:01:13.069> job<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.520> listening<00:01:14.149> and
