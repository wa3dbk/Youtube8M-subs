00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.310
 we are part of a national coordination propellers received in 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.400
 parliament thing that I also said yesterday and went into the local news and wanted 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.749
 to specify. this is what we are teachers of every order and degree 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.489
 and there is the staff ata for administrative technicians all eheh as I said. 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.989
 yesterday these are irrational because they do not allow in a quality and 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.719
 of the school world because we can't talk about reducing quality 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.050
 staff 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.180
 another totally illogical speech so we decided to carry on 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.070
 this protest and from here we will not move there are two guys who 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 they are already starting to have a hunger strike since yesterday 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.080
 surely a little good will will be enough on the part of those who govern us 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.510
 in order to ensure above all the school user 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.410
 a school year records purely serene and he produces teachers 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.870
 support we are qualified people 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.060
 column of specific studies behind it 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.480
 that the state has made us do and the state now tells us after we have taken each other 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.560
 good qualifications band that if you don't rely on the most and the situation is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.020
 devastating because it gives a contribution from a teacher because it has a brightness 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 photo instead of teacher for 4 to the unit is outrageous you are still 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.290
 today to the mortification of workers who have great professionalism 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.460
 which have always been useful inside 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.280
 of red school buildings and therefore to spend the night in Prague 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.830
 in the open having to go on a hunger strike we are talking about p 2000 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.140
 people who in Palermo would find a great situation precisely of 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.070
 extreme poverty despite having the professionalism of a regional government 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.260
 which continually promises aid that then does not come promising 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.240
 the distribution of false funds when in reality you don't even love one euro for 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.700
 being able to expand on this emergency
