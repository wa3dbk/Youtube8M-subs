Highline

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
Highline

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.690 
Highline
I'm<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.590> use<00:00:10.770> a<00:00:10.800> mani<00:00:11.100> rope<00:00:11.400> here

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
I'm just going to use a mani rope here

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.250 
I'm just going to use a mani rope here
this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> about<00:00:12.360> three<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:12.870> rope<00:00:13.050> but

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
this is about three it's rope but

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.460 
this is about three it's rope but
typically<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.450> stouter<00:00:15.450> rope<00:00:15.809> like<00:00:16.200> my

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
typically I use a stouter rope like my

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.859 
typically I use a stouter rope like my
last<00:00:17.279> ropes<00:00:17.580> off<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.910> pack<00:00:18.150> cell<00:00:18.450> which<00:00:18.689> are

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
last ropes off my pack cell which are

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
last ropes off my pack cell which are
even<00:00:19.050> bigger<00:00:19.770> half<00:00:20.130> eighths<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.520> five-eighths

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
even bigger half eighths or five-eighths

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920 
even bigger half eighths or five-eighths
half<00:00:21.990> inch<00:00:22.259> or<00:00:22.410> 5/8<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:24.240> can<00:00:24.540> put<00:00:24.720> two<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
half inch or 5/8 and I can put two of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.569 
half inch or 5/8 and I can put two of
those<00:00:25.020> together<00:00:25.290> and<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:25.829> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> give

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
those together and that's going to give

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.339 
those together and that's going to give
me<00:00:26.669> about<00:00:26.849> 60<00:00:27.149> to<00:00:27.329> 70<00:00:27.360> feet<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.989> rope<00:00:28.140> which

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
me about 60 to 70 feet of rope which

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.790 
me about 60 to 70 feet of rope which
makes<00:00:28.590> pretty<00:00:28.770> good<00:00:28.860> long<00:00:29.160> Highline<00:00:30.200> but<00:00:31.200> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
makes pretty good long Highline but you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.350 
makes pretty good long Highline but you
are<00:00:31.919> on<00:00:32.099> federal<00:00:32.460> land<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.850> should<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.239> these

are on federal land you should use these

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
are on federal land you should use these
tree<00:00:33.570> saver<00:00:33.840> straps<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> don't<00:00:35.550> wring<00:00:35.730> the

slide all these together and this is
attached<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.340> my<00:03:15.610> horse<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:17.020> can't<00:03:17.290> slide

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
attached to my horse and you can't slide

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.430 
attached to my horse and you can't slide
up<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:17.950> down<00:03:18.130> your<00:03:18.340> Highline<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.940> way

call the Highline hitch another one you

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.199 
call the Highline hitch another one you
can<00:03:25.930> do<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.260> call<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> prusik<00:03:26.970> let's<00:03:27.970> take<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
can do is call the prusik let's take a

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.110 
can do is call the prusik let's take a
loop<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> rope<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.980> twist<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.520> three<00:03:30.820> times

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
loop a rope just twist it three times

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.460 
loop a rope just twist it three times
and<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.570> run<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.930> down<00:03:35.200> through<00:03:36.209> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
and just run this down through and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.510 
and just run this down through and
that's<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.620> same<00:03:38.830> principle<00:03:39.070> as<00:03:39.489> that

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
that's the same principle as that

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.850 
that's the same principle as that
Highline<00:03:40.120> hitch<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.930> twists<00:03:47.500> all<00:03:47.620> worked

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
Highline hitch your twists all worked

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.280 
Highline hitch your twists all worked
out<00:03:48.100> okay<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:52.360> then<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.660> gives<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.080> loop

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
out okay and then this gives you a loop

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.650 
out okay and then this gives you a loop
to<00:03:53.470> tie<00:03:53.620> into<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.000> not<00:03:55.180> going<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.420> slide

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
to tie into and it's not going to slide

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.690 
to tie into and it's not going to slide
up<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.959> down<00:03:56.019> your<00:03:56.260> rope<00:03:56.410> either<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.370> this

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
up and down your rope either and this

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.490 
up and down your rope either and this
also<00:03:57.910> acts<00:03:58.180> as<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.420> weak<00:03:58.660> link<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.230> if<00:03:59.350> your

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
also acts as a weak link so if your

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.930 
also acts as a weak link so if your
horse<00:03:59.620> does<00:03:59.739> get<00:04:00.100> into<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.370> bind

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
horse does get into a bind

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.759 
horse does get into a bind
this<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.570> quarter-inch<00:04:02.049> hemp<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.620> will

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
this is quarter-inch hemp and it will

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.259 
this is quarter-inch hemp and it will
break<00:04:03.070> with<00:04:03.489> about<00:04:03.730> three<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.090> four<00:04:04.239> hundred

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
break with about three to four hundred

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.000 
break with about three to four hundred
pounds<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:04.900> pressure<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.560> other<00:04:08.680> thing<00:04:08.890> I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
pounds of pressure and the other thing I

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.620 
pounds of pressure and the other thing I
always<00:04:09.130> do<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.610> Highline<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.150> hang<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.420> bow<00:04:10.570> on

always do in a Highline is hang a bow on

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.509 
always do in a Highline is hang a bow on
it<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.170> can<00:04:11.320> sleep<00:04:11.680> peacefully<00:04:12.250> at<00:04:12.280> night

it so I can sleep peacefully at night
knowing<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.239> my<00:04:13.420> horse<00:04:13.630> does<00:04:13.870> get<00:04:14.110> it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
knowing that if my horse does get it

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.400 
knowing that if my horse does get it
hung<00:04:14.650> up<00:04:15.090> bell<00:04:16.090> ring<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.600> hopefully<00:04:17.049> wake<00:04:17.200> me
