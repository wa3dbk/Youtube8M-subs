00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.389 
is optional you don't have to do that
man<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.829> extremely<00:00:37.829> easy<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
man this is really extremely easy it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.770 
man this is really extremely easy it
looks<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.760> difficult<00:00:39.300> than<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.570> it's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
looks a lot more difficult than one it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.850 
looks a lot more difficult than one it's
okay<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.840> shorter<00:00:43.230> pieces<00:00:43.530> up

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
okay and for me I have shorter pieces up

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
okay and for me I have shorter pieces up
here<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> front<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:45.200> have<00:00:46.200> growing<00:00:46.500> out

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
here in the front I have growing out

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.630 
here in the front I have growing out
bangs<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> lot<00:00:49.920> easier<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
bangs so it's a lot easier to do if you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
bangs so it's a lot easier to do if you
don't<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.210> barely<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.230> fine

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
don't have barely it's going to be fine

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.369 
don't have barely it's going to be fine
too<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.180> it's<00:00:54.180> probably<00:00:54.420> easier<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
too but it's probably easier if you have

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.529 
too but it's probably easier if you have
a<00:00:57.050> shorter<00:00:58.050> piece<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> front<00:00:58.710> okay<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.749 
twisting it try to move it forward
toward<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.410> hairline<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> gives<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.550> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
toward your hairline so it gives that a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.420 
toward your hairline so it gives that a
