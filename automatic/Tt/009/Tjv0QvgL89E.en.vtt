00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.520
 Let's check the picture of Mr. Yoshizawa as well. 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.520
 First, from the side 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:40.950
 It is a very balanced running is not particularly biased song 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.950
 However, I do not seem to be able to get a correct forward leaning posture because I have a little awareness of return 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.620
 So what if you look from the front and the back? 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 I can not get the right posture with my heart open 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.130
 It also seems that there is a difference in arm swing 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.830
 So Yoshizawa's form also Let's fix 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.989

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.660

 In gradually this little gradually go to see if the change Well 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 I feel like I'm bent, so I 'm weak in the first half of the abdominal muscle . 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:11.489
 Well , because there is a correlation between the abdominal muscles and the back of the cat's back 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:16.530
 In order to cure the back of the cat, I induced a small elbow behind my elbow . 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:23.270
 Back muscles so I will improve self-control Please turn around once more 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:29.330

 Please stand and run Please understand 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.569
 It's not like I'm doing this 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:46.540
 Orima is intact because they support me I will now I'm no longer bent or that 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:51.610
 Please eat please fallen that it is immediately 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.720
 I'm using my abs and I won because I wo n't let me go straight 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.689
 In I carved the body straight ones 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.809
 Yes 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.270
 It's not getting more straight 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:06.110
 I have a butt 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:09.890
 Go Habuka was sung lying broken was entered 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.150

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:16.420
 Good 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.420
 Let's go on a train 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:25.640
 Hey you 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.480
 If this is the best person is seen but it looks that but I was the power of the abdominal muscles is not changed so much 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.910
 I think I say 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.170
 The difference seems to be easy to run 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.170
 Then let's go 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.570
 Now let's check the running of post-workout 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.570
 At first from the side 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.490
 Awareness of return has risen considerably 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.370
 Next, let's check the 4 seen from behind 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.750
 I can open my upper body chest 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.750
 It is improved to symmetrical arm swing 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:14.560
 How does it compare the run from the side in two screens 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:20.160
 You are raising a flower remodeling just by being aware of your abs 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.160
 The upper body and one side of the body is now to work smoothly 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:32.679
 Let's compare the mirror surface is also better from the front and behind 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.679
 An increase in awareness around the shoulder blades has enabled effective arm swinging 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.279
 The perspective that I wanted to get a cool form 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:43.779
 I was wearing a beautiful form in this lecture 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.779
