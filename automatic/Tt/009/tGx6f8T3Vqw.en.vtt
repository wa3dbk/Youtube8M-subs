00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
also want to say that both these guns

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.259 
also want to say that both these guns
are<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:55.980> similar<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.820> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> hard<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
are very similar so it's kind of hard to

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.610 
are very similar so it's kind of hard to
find<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.780> things<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.530> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
find some things that they don't have in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.169 
find some things that they don't have in
common<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> did<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.730> best<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.059> could<00:01:00.120> be

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
common but I did my best it could be

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.970 
common but I did my best it could be
kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> picky<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
kind of picky so first off with the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
kind of picky so first off with the
scar-l<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> tell<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.539> low

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
scar-l as you can tell it's a very low

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.180 
scar-l as you can tell it's a very low
recoil<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.800> of<00:01:04.830> people<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
recoil and I think a lot of people do

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.230 
recoil and I think a lot of people do
know<00:01:05.340> that<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
know that and I think that's one of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.540 
know that and I think that's one of the
reasons<00:01:06.570> why<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.410> gun<00:01:07.620> is<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.800> popular<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
reasons why this gun is so popular and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.270 
reasons why this gun is so popular and
also<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.630> has<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.050> great<00:01:10.170> reload<00:01:10.890> cancel

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
also it has a really great reload cancel

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.140 
also it has a really great reload cancel
and<00:01:11.370> I'm<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> guys<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.120> what

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and I'm not sure if you guys know what

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.610 
and I'm not sure if you guys know what
that<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.720> I'll<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:12.900> an<00:01:13.020> annotation<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
that is but I'll put an annotation on

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.350 
that is but I'll put an annotation on
the<00:01:13.680> screen<00:01:13.770> now<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> did<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.550> video<00:01:14.910> right

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the screen now I did this video right

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.610 
the screen now I did this video right
when<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.600> game<00:01:15.750> came<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.410> basically

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
when the game came out and basically

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.620 
when the game came out and basically
what<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.980> can<00:01:17.010> do<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> reload<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.000> gun<00:01:18.180> put

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
what you can do is reload the gun put

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
what you can do is reload the gun put
the<00:01:18.780> magazine<00:01:19.200> into<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.650> gun<00:01:19.800> before<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.640> even

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the magazine into the gun before it even

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.400 
the magazine into the gun before it even
is<00:01:21.120> in<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.900> pretty<00:01:22.050> much<00:01:22.140> get

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
is in there and you can pretty much get

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.230 
is in there and you can pretty much get
a<00:01:22.440> fast<00:01:22.710> reload<00:01:23.130> down<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a fast reload down now if you take a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.970 
a fast reload down now if you take a
look<00:01:24.390> for<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> cons<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.410> scar-l<00:01:25.680> you're

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
look for the cons for the scar-l you're

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.920 
look for the cons for the scar-l you're
going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.160> tell<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.790> damage<00:01:27.240> tends<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
going to tell that it damage tends to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.780 
going to tell that it damage tends to
drop<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.320> after<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.710> certain<00:01:28.950> range<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.400> not

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
drop off after a certain range I'm not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
drop off after a certain range I'm not
too<00:01:30.000> sure<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.210> far<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> range<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.080> but<00:01:31.260> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
too sure how far the range is but this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.630 
too sure how far the range is but this
is<00:01:31.440> one<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.800> things<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> pulls

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
is one of the things that kind of pulls

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
is one of the things that kind of pulls
down<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> gun<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.500> take

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
down the gun a little bit now if we take

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.680 
down the gun a little bit now if we take
a<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.800> at<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.130> ACR<00:01:35.730> guys<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.270> off<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
can tell once again it has a very low

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.100 
can tell once again it has a very low
recoil<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.120> also<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.690> really<00:01:39.900> great<00:01:40.080> for

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
recoil and also it's really great for

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
recoil and also it's really great for
long<00:01:40.410> range<00:01:40.620> I<00:01:40.830> highly<00:01:41.280> suggest<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.730> guys

now<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.650> first<00:03:07.769> I'd<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> say<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.310> lot<00:03:08.519> of

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
now at first I'd like to say a lot of

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.039 
now at first I'd like to say a lot of
people<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.970> surprised<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.569> kind<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.810> shocked

by<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.379> you're<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.859> because<00:03:11.129> a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
by what you're going to see because a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.710 
by what you're going to see because a
lot<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.370> people<00:03:11.459> think<00:03:11.730> well<00:03:11.879> first<00:03:11.910> off<00:03:12.269> hey<00:03:12.690> I

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
lot of people think well first off hey I

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.119 
lot of people think well first off hey I
thought<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.049> ACR<00:03:13.440> at<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.650> lowest<00:03:13.829> amount<00:03:14.040> of

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
thought the ACR at the lowest amount of

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.650 
thought the ACR at the lowest amount of
recoil<00:03:14.370> been<00:03:14.549> as<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.849> see<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.150> screen<00:03:15.359> now

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
recoil been as you can see on screen now

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.630 
recoil been as you can see on screen now
the<00:03:16.140> ACR<00:03:16.560> indeed<00:03:16.890> doesn't<00:03:17.250> really<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.609> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the ACR indeed doesn't really have the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.369 
the ACR indeed doesn't really have the
lowest<00:03:18.030> amount<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.269> recoil<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.780> lot<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.200> people

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
lowest amount of recoil a lot of people

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.720 
lowest amount of recoil a lot of people
may<00:03:19.470> think<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.769> kind<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> laser<00:03:20.430> beam

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
may think it's kind of like a laser beam

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.910 
may think it's kind of like a laser beam
but<00:03:20.879> also<00:03:21.090> guys<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.900> score<00:03:22.109> L<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> really

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
but also guys the score L has a really

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.530 
but also guys the score L has a really
really<00:03:23.040> great<00:03:23.400> kind<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:23.700> recoil<00:03:24.090> pattern<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
really great kind of recoil pattern to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.360 
really great kind of recoil pattern to
it<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.959> more<00:03:25.170> than<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.530> ACR<00:03:25.950> at<00:03:26.130> all

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it it's much more than the ACR at all

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.490 
it it's much more than the ACR at all
distances<00:03:26.760> from<00:03:27.060> close<00:03:27.329> range<00:03:27.450> long<00:03:28.200> range

and<00:03:28.680> from<00:03:28.859> medium<00:03:29.130> range<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.579> scar-l<00:03:29.849> is

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and from medium range the scar-l is

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.339 
and from medium range the scar-l is
going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> out<00:03:30.359> beat<00:03:30.569> as<00:03:30.720> far<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:30.989> recoil

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
going to out beat as far as recoil

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.110 
going to out beat as far as recoil
patterns<00:03:31.650> goes<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.549> goes<00:03:32.700> back<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.910> the

stats<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.540> interesting<00:03:33.930> facts<00:03:34.169> where<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.410> said

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
stats and interesting facts where I said

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.199 
stats and interesting facts where I said
that<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.889> should<00:03:35.130> definitely<00:03:35.250> kind<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.060> look

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
that you should definitely kind of look

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.030 
that you should definitely kind of look
into<00:03:36.389> using<00:03:36.510> kick<00:03:36.870> or<00:03:37.079> stability<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.919> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
into using kick or stability with the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.849 
into using kick or stability with the
ACR<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.930> pretty<00:03:40.139> much<00:03:40.290> rap<00:03:40.500> guys<00:03:40.709> so

conclusion<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:50.639> is<00:03:50.880> better<00:03:51.060> on

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
conclusion on what I think is better on

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.390 
conclusion on what I think is better on
either<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.690> SCAR<00:03:51.959> L<00:03:51.989> or<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.440> ACR<00:03:52.919> now

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
either the SCAR L or the ACR now

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.770 
either the SCAR L or the ACR now
personally<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:53.880> me<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.030> actually<00:03:54.389> think<00:03:54.660> that

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
personally for me I actually think that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.509 
personally for me I actually think that
the<00:03:54.959> ACR<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> little<00:03:55.889> bit<00:03:55.980> better<00:03:56.130> just<00:03:56.370> to

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
the ACR is a little bit better just to

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.520 
the ACR is a little bit better just to
the<00:03:56.639> fact<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:56.910> has<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> higher<00:03:57.450> damage<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.139> lot

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the fact that has a higher damage a lot

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.900 
the fact that has a higher damage a lot
of<00:03:58.590> times<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.889> lot<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.069> my<00:03:59.160> desk<00:03:59.400> will<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.700> course

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
of times a lot of my desk will of course

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.370 
of times a lot of my desk will of course
come<00:04:00.180> from<00:04:00.359> close<00:04:00.540> quarter<00:04:00.780> combat<00:04:00.810> which

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
come from close quarter combat which

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.530 
come from close quarter combat which
kind<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.650> does<00:04:01.829> suck<00:04:02.099> but<00:04:02.310> once<00:04:02.790> again<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.120> ACR

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
kind of does suck but once again the ACR

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.300 
kind of does suck but once again the ACR
from<00:04:03.810> long<00:04:04.019> range<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.470> for<00:04:04.739> medium<00:04:05.010> range<00:04:05.129> is

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
from long range and for medium range is

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.530 
from long range and for medium range is
just<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:05.700> much<00:04:05.819> better<00:04:05.879> because<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.419> has<00:04:06.510> a

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
just that much better because it has a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.479 
just that much better because it has a
better<00:04:06.780> damage<00:04:07.019> from<00:04:07.349> medium<00:04:07.680> range<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:08.010> of

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
better damage from medium range and of
