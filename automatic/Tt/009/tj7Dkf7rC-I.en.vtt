00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.380 
exacting its precise and because it's
all<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.780> America<00:02:20.200> these<00:02:20.470> days<00:02:20.740> it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
all in America these days it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
all in America these days it's
incredibly<00:02:22.390> unique<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.830> that's<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
incredibly unique and and that's just a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.120 
incredibly unique and and that's just a
part<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.870> very<00:02:26.050> important<00:02:26.470> part<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.860> what

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
part of in a very important part of what

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.740 
part of in a very important part of what
I<00:02:27.190> think<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.270> special<00:02:28.720> about<00:02:28.780> Ascot<00:02:30.600> yeah

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
I think is so special about Ascot yeah

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.650 
I think is so special about Ascot yeah
and<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.920> new<00:02:33.040> rod<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:34.300> new<00:02:34.390> parts

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and with the new rod the new parts

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.830 
and with the new rod the new parts
called<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> Radian<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.790> first<00:02:37.150> rod<00:02:37.570> we've

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
called a Radian it's the first rod we've

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.560 
called a Radian it's the first rod we've
named<00:02:38.320> with<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> name<00:02:39.160> other<00:02:39.400> than<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.450> know

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
named with a name other than a you know

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.260 
named with a name other than a you know
a<00:02:40.770> letter<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.100> number<00:02:42.130> type<00:02:42.640> nomenclature

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
a letter and a number type nomenclature

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.600 
a letter and a number type nomenclature
and<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.800> believe<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.760> Radian<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:47.610> mathematical

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and I believe a Radian is a mathematical

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.210 
and I believe a Radian is a mathematical
term<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.450> allows<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.020> determine<00:02:50.710> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
term that allows you to determine the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.700 
term that allows you to determine the
arc<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.090> radius<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.570> circle<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.470> one

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
arc and radius of a circle in just one

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.080 
arc and radius of a circle in just one
figure<00:02:54.360> though<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> don't<00:02:55.570> know<00:02:55.750> math<00:02:55.990> is

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
figure though I don't know math is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.980 
figure though I don't know math is
supposed<00:02:58.090> me<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:01.030> Scott<00:03:01.270> Radian<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
supposed me the Scott Radian is going to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.720 
supposed me the Scott Radian is going to
be<00:03:02.080> available<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.710> all<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> really

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
be available in all of the really

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.180 
be available in all of the really
essential<00:03:04.140> freshwater<00:03:05.140> lengths<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:06.010> go

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
essential freshwater lengths they go

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.860 
essential freshwater lengths they go
from<00:03:06.370> an<00:03:06.610> eight<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.090> half<00:03:07.210> foot<00:03:07.450> four<00:03:07.720> way

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
from an eight and a half foot four way

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.930 
from an eight and a half foot four way
all<00:03:08.710> the<00:03:08.890> way<00:03:08.980> up<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> ten<00:03:09.460> foot<00:03:09.610> eight<00:03:09.790> way

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
all the way up to a ten foot eight way

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.820 
all the way up to a ten foot eight way
so<00:03:10.540> there's<00:03:10.780> eight<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> half<00:03:11.320> footers

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
so there's eight and a half footers

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.060 
so there's eight and a half footers
there's<00:03:12.400> nine<00:03:12.700> footers<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.300> course<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.070> there

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
there's nine footers of course and there

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.480 
there's nine footers of course and there
are<00:03:15.310> 10<00:03:15.760> footers<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.350> really<00:03:17.710> it's<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.160> wide

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
are 10 footers it's a really it's a wide
