here again with another computer video
and<00:00:05.910> there's<00:00:06.029> something<00:00:06.420> else<00:00:06.600> about<00:00:06.810> this

dead<00:00:11.190> giveaway<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.480> difference<00:00:12.870> in

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
dead giveaway is the difference in

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.799 
dead giveaway is the difference in
aspect<00:00:13.530> ratio<00:00:14.009> from<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.880> normal<00:00:15.089> videos<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
aspect ratio from my normal videos this

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.170 
aspect ratio from my normal videos this
one<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.139> being<00:00:16.379> shot<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> 4<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> 3<00:00:17.550> aspect

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
one is being shot in the 4 to 3 aspect

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.980 
one is being shot in the 4 to 3 aspect
ratio<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:18.960> opposed<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> 16<00:00:20.460> by<00:00:20.699> 9<00:00:20.960> what<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
ratio as opposed to the 16 by 9 what I

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
ratio as opposed to the 16 by 9 what I
have<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.920> something<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.880> actually

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
have here is something that I actually

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.320 
have here is something that I actually
purchased<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.529> co-worker<00:00:25.970> who<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> moving

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.890 
purchased from a co-worker who is moving
away<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> those<00:00:30.330> good<00:00:30.630> deals

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
away and this is one of those good deals

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160 
away and this is one of those good deals
that<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> person<00:00:31.650> should<00:00:31.679> never<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.279> into<00:00:33.170> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
that a person should never get into to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.120 
that a person should never get into to
put<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> mildly

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
put it mildly

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.069 
put it mildly
they<00:00:35.969> probably<00:00:36.180> should<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.480> paid<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
they probably should have paid me to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
take it but I'm only out a couple of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
bucks so it was no big deal

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
bucks so it was no big deal
and<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.399> paid<00:00:41.879> bizarre<00:00:42.270> fur<00:00:42.540> head

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780

to run Windows XP satisfactorily and so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.260 
to run Windows XP satisfactorily and so
I<00:02:00.270> suspect<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.869> many<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.439> machines

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
I suspect that many of these machines

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.550 
I suspect that many of these machines

ended up in the landfill which is
unfortunate<00:02:05.219> because<00:02:05.340> although<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:05.969> are

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.229 
still see a few of them back in there
looks<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:56.980> maybe<00:02:57.280> they're<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.610> byproduct

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
looks like maybe they're the byproduct

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.119 
looks like maybe they're the byproduct
of<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.450> spider<00:02:58.810> or<00:02:59.110> an<00:02:59.260> insect<00:02:59.620> or<00:02:59.860> something

never did figure out for sure what the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.589 
never did figure out for sure what the
for<00:03:26.769> diagnostic<00:03:27.489> LEDs<00:03:27.910> were<00:03:28.150> doing<00:03:28.389> but<00:03:28.569> I

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
for diagnostic LEDs were doing but I

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.300 
for diagnostic LEDs were doing but I
believe<00:03:28.870> they<00:03:29.049> were<00:03:29.109> all<00:03:29.319> orange<00:03:29.769> at<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.069> time

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
believe they were all orange at the time

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.330 
believe they were all orange at the time
which<00:03:30.579> is<00:03:30.760> generally<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> bad<00:03:31.959> sign<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:33.160> what

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
which is generally a bad sign so what

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.839 
which is generally a bad sign so what
did<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.579> do

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
did I do

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.479 
did I do
I<00:03:34.170> took<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.440> motherboard<00:03:35.859> out<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.250> thing

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
I took the motherboard out of this thing

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.460 
I took the motherboard out of this thing
and<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:37.180> washed<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.599> by<00:03:37.780> hand<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.290> actually

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
and I washed it by hand and I actually

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.259 
and I washed it by hand and I actually
should<00:03:38.829> have<00:03:38.920> done<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.130> video<00:03:39.340> about<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:40.060> but

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
should have done a video about that but

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.379 
should have done a video about that but
I<00:03:40.299> didn't<00:03:41.010> despite<00:03:42.010> its<00:03:42.190> simplicity<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
I didn't despite its simplicity and the

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.240 
I didn't despite its simplicity and the
lack<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.599> an<00:03:43.870> AGP<00:03:44.380> slot<00:03:44.590> although<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.040> can

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
lack of an AGP slot although you can

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.039 
lack of an AGP slot although you can
tell<00:03:45.459> they<00:03:45.609> thought<00:03:45.849> about<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:47.019> a

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
tell they thought about it this is a

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.740 
tell they thought about it this is a
notable<00:03:47.470> improvement<00:03:48.130> from<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.940> 2300

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
notable improvement from the the 2300

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.870 
notable improvement from the the 2300
series<00:03:50.079> machine<00:03:50.440> because<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> 2300<00:03:51.579> series

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
series machine because the 2300 series

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.259 
series machine because the 2300 series
machine<00:03:52.239> gives<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.049> four<00:03:53.349> PCI<00:03:53.829> slots<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.669> no

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
machine gives you four PCI slots and no

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.559 
machine gives you four PCI slots and no
artifact<00:03:56.019> for<00:03:56.230> an<00:03:56.319> AGP<00:03:56.859> slot<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:58.329> it's<00:03:58.450> very

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
artifact for an AGP slot so it's very

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.940 
artifact for an AGP slot so it's very
interesting<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.319> don't<00:03:59.380> think<00:03:59.680> there's<00:03:59.859> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
interesting I don't think there's a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.789 
interesting I don't think there's a
whole<00:04:00.069> lot<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.549> separates<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.239> 2350<00:04:02.200> from

whole lot that separates the 2350 from

actually works properly in this system I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.659 
actually works properly in this system I
did<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.109> totally<00:04:17.560> clean<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.950> fan<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.519> what<00:04:18.639> I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
did not totally clean the fan but what I

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.599 
did not totally clean the fan but what I
did<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.120> definitely<00:04:19.630> an<00:04:19.750> improvement<00:04:20.609> you

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
did was definitely an improvement you

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.150 
did was definitely an improvement you

more<00:04:40.950> than<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.310> rebadged<00:04:41.730> light<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.360> Drive<00:04:42.690> and

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
more than a rebadged light on Drive and

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.300 
more than a rebadged light on Drive and
they<00:04:45.420> never<00:04:45.660> set<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.200> jumpers<00:04:46.650> up<00:04:46.830> properly

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
they never set the jumpers up properly

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.220 
they never set the jumpers up properly
so<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.060> only<00:04:48.210> drive<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.750> ever<00:04:48.900> showed<00:04:49.200> up

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
so the only drive that ever showed up

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.210 
so the only drive that ever showed up
was<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.280> original<00:04:50.760> Delhi<00:04:51.030> issued<00:04:51.480> cd-rom<00:04:52.220> so

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
was the original Delhi issued cd-rom so

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.650 
was the original Delhi issued cd-rom so
that<00:04:53.370> was<00:04:53.490> kind<00:04:53.730> of<00:04:53.820> pointless<00:04:54.120> but<00:04:54.420> in<00:04:54.570> a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
that was kind of pointless but in a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.120 
that was kind of pointless but in a
moment<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:55.050> had<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.320> figured<00:04:55.620> out<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.100> I

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
moment I had it figured out because I

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.420 
moment I had it figured out because I
set<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.640> jumpers<00:04:57.030> back<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.390> cable<00:04:57.750> select<00:04:58.080> and

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
set the jumpers back to cable select and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.370 
set the jumpers back to cable select and
everything<00:04:59.430> was<00:04:59.610> good<00:04:59.790> they<00:05:00.090> had<00:05:00.300> two<00:05:00.810> masters

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
everything was good they had two masters

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.160 
everything was good they had two masters
on<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.370> chain<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.910> instead<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.600> that<00:05:03.750> locking

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
on the chain and instead of that locking

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.170 
on the chain and instead of that locking
up<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.440> system<00:05:04.890> it<00:05:05.070> just<00:05:05.340> politely<00:05:05.910> ignored

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
up the system it just politely ignored

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.450 
up the system it just politely ignored
this<00:05:06.690> Drive<00:05:06.960> up<00:05:07.170> here<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:08.130> one<00:05:08.310> down

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
this Drive up here and this one down

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.430 
this Drive up here and this one down
here<00:05:08.520> kept<00:05:09.030> working<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.930> floppy<00:05:10.200> drive

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
here kept working the floppy drive

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.400 
here kept working the floppy drive
actually<00:05:10.860> works<00:05:11.690> everything<00:05:12.690> works<00:05:12.960> well<00:05:13.200> now

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
actually works everything works well now

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.520 
actually works everything works well now
but<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.680> was<00:05:13.860> really<00:05:14.130> surprised<00:05:14.700> that<00:05:15.530> washing

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
but I was really surprised that washing

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.380 
but I was really surprised that washing
this<00:05:16.710> motherboard<00:05:17.070> was<00:05:17.400> actually<00:05:17.820> sufficient

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
this motherboard was actually sufficient

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.240 
this motherboard was actually sufficient
to<00:05:18.510> bring<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.810> back<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.170> life<00:05:19.200> because<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:19.830> tried

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
to bring it back to life because I tried

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.830 
to bring it back to life because I tried
first<00:05:20.960> pulling<00:05:21.960> out<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.440> CMOS<00:05:23.220> battery<00:05:23.840> to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
first pulling out the CMOS battery to

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.810 
first pulling out the CMOS battery to
see<00:05:25.020> if<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.260> simply<00:05:25.620> needed<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.920> be<00:05:26.040> reset<00:05:26.550> and

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
see if it simply needed to be reset and

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.430 
see if it simply needed to be reset and
after<00:05:27.450> sitting<00:05:27.780> with<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:28.020> battery<00:05:28.350> out

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
after sitting with the battery out

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.950 
after sitting with the battery out
overnight<00:05:28.920> it<00:05:29.280> wasn't<00:05:29.640> any<00:05:29.790> happier<00:05:30.270> so<00:05:30.930> I

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
overnight it wasn't any happier so I

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.750 
overnight it wasn't any happier so I
simply<00:05:31.260> stripped<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.890> board<00:05:32.130> down<00:05:32.340> pulled

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
simply stripped the board down pulled

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.130 
simply stripped the board down pulled
the<00:05:32.880> battery<00:05:33.240> off<00:05:33.480> of<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:35.750> gave<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.960> good

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
the battery off of it and gave it a good
