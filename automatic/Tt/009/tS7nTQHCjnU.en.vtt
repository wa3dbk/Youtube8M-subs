00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.980
 easy fast salmon cakes and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.290
 delicious I am your shadow or mendia 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 distracted and today I will show you how to do 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 salmon cakes which are a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.950
 great way to include fish to your 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
 diet there are two reasons why I 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.150
 like this recipe one is that it is easy and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 we usually find the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.290
 ingredients in the house the second reason 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.690
 is that raw ingredients are not used 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.000
 so you do not have to worry if your 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.910
 fish is overcooked or raw 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 let 's start it 's very simple we'll start with 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 some green onions that I've cut and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 some red peppers that I have also 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 cut these will be the seasoning of the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 salmon cakes I add a couple of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.960
 tablespoons of lemon juice and then use 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.210
 low fat sour cream 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 if you want you can replace it with 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 a little greek yogurt 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.300
 I will also use two tablespoons of 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.059
 dijon mustard 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 this will add a bit of flavor and for 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.619
 Finally put half a cup of Crumble 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.630
 bread but if you do not want to use the crumb of 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.890
 bread 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 if you do not want gluten you can use oatmeal 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.060
 or gluten-free bread if desired 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.060
 we mix this 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 and finally we put it in our 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.920
 salmon now if you not prosecuted 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 canned salmon is a bit daunting 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.050
 when you open it maybe you will find a 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.780
 little skin maybe a bone or two does not 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.820
 worry about this this is excellent can 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 of canned salmon and I just shredded 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.210
 the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.210
 I will mix everything 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 we combine everything perfectly and can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 see that now I have a very good mix 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.080
 with which I will form pancakes 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 and again since there is nothing raw 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.110
 you can eat it as it is if you 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.549
 you want good now that we have this what 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.739
 What I'm going to do is shape it 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.239
 pancakes and the easiest way to 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.120
 doing it is with a piece of paper 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.390
 waxed I'll take a handful like this and 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 only we shape pancake 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.530
 a few inches 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.269
 we match the edges 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.250
 and will probably be obtained from 5 to 6 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.650
 pancakes of the mix here I have one that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.560
 I already let me bring them and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.900
 we will continue cooking you are my frying pan 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 it's ready so I'll just put 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.400
 a little oil is not going to stick but 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
 we'll put a little bit to make sure 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.380
 that do not stick I'll move it a little and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.380
 I will continue putting my pancakes inside 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.390
 and if it starts to crumble a bit 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.110
 just put the other ones together with your hand and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.110
 remain like this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.990
 this will take a little bit until they get 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.990
 a little coffee on one side 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.680
 and when we turn them over we cook them 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.680
 another side we will have finished
