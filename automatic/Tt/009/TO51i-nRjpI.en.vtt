 with the tastes bundesliga at the level of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.099
 the team so always the same 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.750
 bundesliga in fact every time I 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.710
 change the attacking red player whose 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.029
 I need 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.679
 the review of earlier this will be the one 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.939
 of mario mandzukic version poses so 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.589
 you will see that the team will have just the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.939
 kitsch point-to-point you have some 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.839
 statins that are scrolling I 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.980
 invites you to put on pause must 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.120
 put back into a problem is observed 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.769
 for those who wish to buy 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 credits watts vins.com 5% in elections 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.019
 and casserole made credit mode should 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.579
 in the weeks following the purchase 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.320
 according to available stocks 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.820
 the information in the description so 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.290
 their station started talking about the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.210
 price as I usually do a 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.699
 million 30000 credit at the moment 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.159
 does the review ie 20h20 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.409
 that is Friday 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.659
 11h47 exactly it was wednesday 20h 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.799
 surely a bug is what it's worth 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.350
 blow to put so much that's true 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.449
 that it is much cheaper than a case 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.430
 robben but he's also less strong than 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.310
 robben even though he still has a note 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.210
 a very very good note but in fact 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.369
 I found that there is no real 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 difference with the second jeans form you 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.450
 meaning it's a little better but that 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.280
 is really not playing at all I will not be 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.530
 how to explain it you feel that it intox 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 in fact but there is no real 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.400
 difference with the cifch what the cif 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.350
 is already really very very good so 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.390
 I was pretty disappointed at first it's true 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.040
 but then I dropped the usual tweet 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.930
 and then he ramped up suddenly 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.100
 whenever I have a day I 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.450
 finds a coward a tweet or Thursday 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.580
 that he is bad and there strangely he 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 it starts to score so if 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 you have twitter and you have some 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.200
 problems with critics the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.670
 and he will become strong so at the level of 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.260
 negatives his headplay this is it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 head game it's really the only points 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.830
 negatives that I put him points 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.409
 negative side but that I held 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.940
 good to specify it 1,81 in tents 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.440
 but still low and take no 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.659
 balloons of the head it is not great 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.799
 thing and 1.58 in head accuracy 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.750
 so it's still pretty 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.920
 disgusting on that side at the level of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.909
 positive bridges so now the shots 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.900
 of foot stopped the cornell and that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.220
 really very very well I did 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.840
 besides a lot of assists 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.390
 on a corner so that's nice 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 to have a very good corner shooter at 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 formwork level is 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.890
 Unfortunately no, but suddenly 97 years 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.250
 franc 90 is indeed 98 power of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.110
 hit 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.280
 if you know how to take the free kicks there 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.680
 will have no worries this side has mostly 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.239
 that I remember that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.829
 this is one of the players with whom I 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.609
 prefers to take the free kicks but 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.560
 unfortunately I did not have 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.599
 the opportunity to draw and at the level of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 Penalties 20 81 59 chi so it stays 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.900
 reasonable and I had one or two 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.329
 penalties in the journal and I have them 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.829
 marked both at the level of at 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.420
 level of finishing now 99 in 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.799
 finish so for a wingman left side 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.239
 who crawls who was right handed it's 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.950
 really very interesting turin foot 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.959
 right you hit were almost goals 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.060
 every time I advise you by 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.750
 against 2 I really advise you to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.019
 strike in force 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.790
 his foot is good but I prefer 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.680
 really his hits in strength which a lot 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.560
 more than they more devastating in 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.389
 car without he still has 98 in 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.189
 hitting power and blow it off 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.480
 is still unlike his shot 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.669
 in force at close range 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.870
 at the level of languages ​​4.99 to 98 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.069
 punching power again 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.480
 unfortunately not really 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.579
 illustration of new shock languages 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.150
 however I tried it but it was not 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.609
 not enough 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.019
 it was not pretty enough 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.219
 was not doing well enough for me to put 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.750
 that in the art view but I tried 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.519
 something eh the ball apart when 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.750
 even the ball goes well but at 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.980
 every time I had to have some 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.569
 problems at the level of the gauge fel 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.859
 positioning is always well placed 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.349
 he really takes very very well the 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.449
 depth and he is he gets to himself 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.489
 make available often enough and 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.530
 kick low the marco reused low that makes that 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.229
 you find yourself you will find very 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.840
 easily after his physique 77 in 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.129
 force with 1.89 in balance he holds 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.229
 very very good on his legs on this side 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.689
 there will be no problem if you 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:39.879
 if you have backward side kind to 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.709
 walker or something like that 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.109
 without worry you will move to the shoulder 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.689
 the speed obviously it goes very very 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.069
 fast in 94 in speed layton 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.329
 the todd wingers if i have the impression 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.970
 that the speeds that put it back it's 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.340
 anything they have they all have 93 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.989
 minimum we will say and suddenly you 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.849
 really makes the difference on this side 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.349
 there and the four states bad foot he has 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.419
 both feet so that you that even without 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.769
 tripod left when you overflow side 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.599
 left you can center with his bad 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.040
 foot the ball will go well so the 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.489
 review of the marco reus version team of the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.910
 season 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.320
 you have the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.280
 balance now in positive benches 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.480
 as I have stopped kicks 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.950
 pulled really well the corners the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.150
 free kicks she has very good stats 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.489
 so if you already know the free kicks 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.720
 and wins this side there benatia 85 at 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.810
 penalty so that's always the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.940
 difference and made flying finish 199 in 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.220
 finish which is very interesting its 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.050
 speed before catching it when 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.190
 even going physical there is very very 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.740
 well on his legs and that's when 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.060
 even pretty cool longshot 99 in chat 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.250
 positioning still well in place and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.870
 as I wanted 10 4 stars bad 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.190
 foot its pass quality I do not have 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.930
 talk too much but the quality of passes 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.030
 whether it's the centers the passes in 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.220
 depth small short passes 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.720
 have between 2 3 players frankly that 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.030
 pass cream it's really very very good 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 smuggler you still feel who has 88 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.780
 on the map and his passing it 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.220
 Feel pretty much his power of 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.840
 hits he hits very very hard four 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.640
 floors and technique I'm little what it 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.350
 is with and that's always a big 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.790
 positive point is therefore at the level of 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.410
 Negatives his heading ability is 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.220
 true that it's really secondary so 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.600
 a 20 out of 20 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.830
 although I found there was no 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.480
 real difference with the second of a 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.210
 forms a small improvement but 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.710
 really light and suddenly blow 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.910
 so it stays before me because 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.130
 that I remember that the civb 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.870
 immigration rightly so is so at 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.430
 level of statistics with seven 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.750
 matches 11 goals 7 assists 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.270
 so that's still a very very 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.430
 good balance for a winger is not necessary 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.990
 forget that he is a winger and 11 goals 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.520
 in 7 matches it's cool knowing that there 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.070
 there are assists there I managed to 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.300
 make assists and suddenly he 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.680
 is really complete so that's it 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.850
 beautiful the life of my reconversion team of 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.169
 the season I hope this review 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.150

 you new review on the channel one 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.310
 of mario mandzukic version team of the 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.750
 season I'm telling you I'm going 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.190
