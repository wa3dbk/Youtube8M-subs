fundamental important ways unfortunately

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
fundamental important ways unfortunately
the<00:00:35.579> answer<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.059> question<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.690> almost

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the answer to that question is almost

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.580 
the answer to that question is almost
always<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.860> than<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.750> two<00:00:39.750> three<00:00:40.320> at

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
always no more than this two three at

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.010 
always no more than this two three at
most<00:00:40.860> five<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.790> me<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.090> numbers<00:00:42.510> three<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
most five for me that numbers three and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.970 
most five for me that numbers three and
that's<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.100> unusual<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.739> gives

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that's not unusual so what is what gives

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.680 
that's not unusual so what is what gives
here<00:00:47.309> by<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.210> wouldn't<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> be

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
here by the way they wouldn't have to be

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.850 
here by the way they wouldn't have to be
science<00:00:48.989> teachers<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:49.379> talking<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.620> teachers

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
science teachers I'm talking my teachers

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
science teachers I'm talking my teachers
in<00:00:49.980> any<00:00:50.100> subject<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.940> makes<00:00:51.120> those

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in any subject and what makes those

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
in any subject and what makes those
teachers<00:00:51.660> special<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.399> could<00:00:53.550> have

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
teachers special is that you could have

extend this to the sciences we all know
people<00:01:48.299> who<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.869> turn<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.200> by<00:01:49.380> science

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
people who would turn off by science

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.160 
people who would turn off by science
because<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.159> had<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> bad<00:01:50.549> teacher<00:01:51.170> that's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
the worst case the teacher the teacher

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
the worst case the teacher the teacher
now<00:01:54.840> had<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> opposite<00:01:55.530> effect<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.979> what

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
now had the opposite effect of what
