00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 I would like to show you today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.919
 I did that here, that's one 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.170
 old felt bag and something 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.099
 other to the normal long ones 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 stories all bags and yes I 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 personally think the idea is very funny 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.650
 and if you do not want to see them 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.010
 because they are technically difficult 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 to do and everyone has the sewing machine 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 can easily imitate them 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 yes, if you want to see how I did 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 have 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.390
 then stay tuned and I want 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.670
 say how much fun video for the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.200
 bag you need a little thicker 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.090
 I felt I was here for women in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 Clinics or any other color you like 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.730
 then want a white thinner felt 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.340
 and a yellow gets everyone 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 craft store and it is not expensive and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 then an ipad if you have as 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.530
 measure the mass I write you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 but otherwise also the martini infobox 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.539
 if you can and have a bag for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.340
 wanted to give away as 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 First I have the iPad on the felt 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.629
 lay around to watch how tall those are 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.250
 you have to learn to bag 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.000
 of course, wait for the bag something 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.479
 must be bigger than the ipad and that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.130
 ipad of course fits in then I have 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 yes from the movie cut two parts 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.670
 the front and back of course 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.670
 should be the same size 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.220
 then I felt already on the white 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.010
 times the lettering prepared for it 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.850
 written what I would have snowed too 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:35.560
 then and then on one side 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 the gray felt on it approached 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.770
 and since the yes in the form of a mirror ice 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.320
 is still to be shown 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.380
 yellow from egg and for only cuts 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.880
 just make a circle out of the gamepad 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.970
 Now you are still involved 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.810
 Some need not sew anything when sewing 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 slips and you plan it on it 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.300
 can take as it wanted to have 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.520
 and then I start with the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.870
 Sewing machine just outside the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.790
 to take a mouth 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.200
 It really is not hard you have to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.459
 Just take care that you are 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.390
 right now and that i feel there 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.610
 somehow conclusion 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.030
 and yes, then that should not really 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.370
 be a problem 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 Now I'll have another button on top 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.390
 The bags with the ipad also not 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.980
 I drop the button first 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.720
 sometimes the place where the button after 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.519
 to be sewn and make me 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.510
 small limit how big the skimpy 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.819
 is endangered and then I cut myself 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.080
 a gap between the two 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.519
 limit where the button then later 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.910
 comes through as I here just 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.910
 make 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.700
 then test once if the club too 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.120
 really by almost then I go once 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 to these basic ton cut so once 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.840
 looks more beautiful and not somehow 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.840
 frayed or something 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.150
 and then the button on the film side 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.030
 the later below so the lower 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.410
 side and that the button then in 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.000
 uses 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.980
 I'll show you what I am 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 So my here is the once 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.410
 bottom and then say the top 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.110
 The bag and I have the fight in 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.770
 sewed on it then so the sides 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.390
 can do two sides together and 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.560
 now only the fact that the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.280
 two sides sewn together 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.840
 and I just have to go for that 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.090
 three sides together to the top of course 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.060
 on the opening because there it has to be easy 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.220
 yes come in and then it is 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.290
 bag done so far and you can do it 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.430
 give away here again or directly yours 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.290
 put the ipad in the box 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.680
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.980
 and if you make the bag after 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.550
 of course you should be happy about photos 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.750
 always to see your counterfeit things 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.440
 and I would say that you are in his 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.440
 next song yes i would say one 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.440
 self-thaler 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.729
 the
