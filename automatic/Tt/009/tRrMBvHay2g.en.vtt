10 degrees Celsius and it got colder as

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.479 
10 degrees Celsius and it got colder as
we<00:02:52.659> went<00:02:52.930> along<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.469> at<00:02:53.889> the<00:02:54.040> day<00:02:54.219> it<00:02:54.400> was

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
we went along and at the day it was

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.319 
we went along and at the day it was
maximum<00:02:55.389> about<00:02:55.949> 16<00:02:56.949> degrees<00:02:57.189> Celsius<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
maximum about 16 degrees Celsius the

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.629 
maximum about 16 degrees Celsius the
water<00:02:58.629> temperature<00:02:59.139> was<00:02:59.530> about<00:03:00.069> 1<00:03:00.400> degree

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
water temperature was about 1 degree

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.869 
water temperature was about 1 degree
Celsius<00:03:01.439> which<00:03:02.439> was<00:03:02.709> about<00:03:03.040> 34<00:03:03.669> degrees

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.089 
Celsius which was about 34 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.049> water<00:03:05.319> temperature<00:03:05.769> if

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
Fahrenheit so the water temperature if

are in chance of suffering hypothermia
within<00:03:11.859> four<00:03:12.129> minutes<00:03:13.109> why<00:03:14.109> were<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.349> doing

was very exciting a great opportunity
let's<00:03:32.889> get<00:03:33.069> some<00:03:33.220> visuals<00:03:33.609> just<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:34.000> get<00:03:34.389> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
let's get some visuals just to get the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.420 
let's get some visuals just to get the
feel<00:03:34.569> before<00:03:35.169> we<00:03:35.439> find<00:03:35.680> out<00:03:35.829> what<00:03:36.069> went<00:03:36.310> wrong

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
feel before we find out what went wrong

with<00:03:36.879> this<00:03:37.060> training<00:03:37.509> exercise<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.259> think<00:03:39.009> this

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
with this training exercise I think this

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.300 
with this training exercise I think this
is<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.549> Hercules<00:03:40.419> right<00:03:40.810> c-130<00:03:41.620> Hercules<00:03:42.099> we
