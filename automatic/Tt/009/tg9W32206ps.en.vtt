up with all the little component parts
and<00:00:23.590> that<00:00:24.590> allowed<00:00:24.890> me<00:00:24.920> to<00:00:25.190> to<00:00:27.250> draw<00:00:28.250> a<00:00:28.280> bunch

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
and that allowed me to to draw a bunch

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.720 
and that allowed me to to draw a bunch
of<00:00:28.730> similar<00:00:29.590> tiny<00:00:30.590> house<00:00:30.770> plans<00:00:31.450> and<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:34.430> the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
is is I'm not exactly sure how many

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.499 
is is I'm not exactly sure how many
pages<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.219> it'll<00:01:13.399> probably<00:01:13.610> grow<00:01:14.149> over

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
pages is it and it'll probably grow over

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.590 
pages is it and it'll probably grow over
time<00:01:15.640> like<00:01:16.640> for<00:01:16.820> instance<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:17.360> I've<00:01:17.509> been

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
time like for instance as I've been

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.270 
time like for instance as I've been
playing<00:01:17.899> with<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.770> know<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.250> to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
playing with it I I now know I want to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.940 
playing with it I I now know I want to
add<00:01:19.460> say<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.420> made<00:01:20.600> some<00:01:20.950> pre-configured

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
add say I made some pre-configured

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.560 
add say I made some pre-configured
bathrooms<00:01:22.610> I'm<00:01:23.030> gonna<00:01:23.270> make<00:01:23.450> some

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
bathrooms I'm gonna make some

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.899 
bathrooms I'm gonna make some
pre-configured<00:01:24.170> kitchens<00:01:24.619> too<00:01:24.979> because<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
pre-configured kitchens too because the

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.219 
pre-configured kitchens too because the
kitchen<00:01:26.270> parts<00:01:26.509> are<00:01:26.630> really<00:01:26.719> hard<00:01:26.990> these

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
kitchen parts are really hard these

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.050 
kitchen parts are really hard these
kitchen<00:01:27.619> parts<00:01:27.920> are<00:01:28.310> really<00:01:28.490> hard<00:01:28.789> to<00:01:28.820> work

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
kitchen parts are really hard to work

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.399 
kitchen parts are really hard to work
with<00:01:29.299> so<00:01:29.539> I'm<00:01:29.630> gonna<00:01:29.780> make<00:01:29.930> something<00:01:30.140> like

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
with so I'm gonna make something like

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.670 
with so I'm gonna make something like
that<00:01:30.560> for<00:01:30.740> kitchens<00:01:31.009> but<00:01:31.189> anyway<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.530> then

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
that for kitchens but anyway so then

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.380 
that for kitchens but anyway so then
what<00:01:33.859> you<00:01:33.950> do<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.579> you<00:01:34.609> print<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.939> out<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.299> I

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
what you do so you print it out and I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.349 
what you do so you print it out and I
had<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.689> printed<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.079> at<00:01:36.439> Kinkos<00:01:36.829> FedEx<00:01:37.369> on<00:01:37.759> one

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
had it printed it at Kinkos FedEx on one

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.120 
had it printed it at Kinkos FedEx on one
10-pound<00:01:38.899> cardstock<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:39.740> works<00:01:39.890> really

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
10-pound cardstock and that works really

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.020 
10-pound cardstock and that works really
nice<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:41.240> makes<00:01:41.359> a<00:01:41.539> nice<00:01:41.719> thick<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:42.829> know

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
nice it makes a nice thick you know

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.849 
nice it makes a nice thick you know
material<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.179> work<00:01:44.299> with<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.590> then<00:01:45.740> you

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
material to work with and then you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.510 
material to work with and then you
basically<00:01:46.219> cut<00:01:46.789> out<00:01:46.939> your<00:01:47.149> parts<00:01:48.130> as<00:01:49.130> neatly

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
basically cut out your parts as neatly

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.359 
basically cut out your parts as neatly
or<00:01:49.759> not<00:01:49.909> neatly<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:50.359> you<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:50.750> because<00:01:51.679> you

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
or not neatly as you like because you

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.980 
or not neatly as you like because you
know<00:01:52.490> if<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.479> neater<00:01:53.689> it's

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
know if it's a little neater it's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.080 
know if it's a little neater it's
probably<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.770> little<00:01:55.460> easier<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.909> work<00:01:56.030> with

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
probably a little easier to work with

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.669 
probably a little easier to work with
but<00:01:56.600> otherwise<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:59.630> know<00:01:59.719> it's<00:02:00.109> pretty<00:02:00.590> easy

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
but otherwise you know it's pretty easy

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.160 
but otherwise you know it's pretty easy
anyway<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.450> I'm<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:02.689> clear<00:02:03.020> my<00:02:03.049> space<00:02:03.619> here

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
anyway so I'm just clear my space here

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.070 
anyway so I'm just clear my space here
pardon<00:02:06.170> my<00:02:06.289> barking<00:02:06.710> dog<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.249> background

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
pardon my barking dog in the background

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.080 
pardon my barking dog in the background
so<00:02:10.080> here<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.740> what<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> found<00:02:11.820> is<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.850> kind<00:02:14.850> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so here and what I found is it's kind of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.630 
so here and what I found is it's kind of
hard<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:17.300> move<00:02:18.300> stuff<00:02:18.600> around<00:02:19.250> paper<00:02:20.250> around

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
hard to move stuff around paper around

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
hard to move stuff around paper around
on<00:02:20.940> paper<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.990> mean<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.260> would<00:02:22.410> be

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
on paper like this I mean this would be

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.530 
on paper like this I mean this would be
awesome<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.010> these<00:02:23.160> are<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.490> magnets<00:02:24.240> or

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
awesome if these are like magnets or

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.890 
awesome if these are like magnets or
something<00:02:24.960> on<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> magnet<00:02:25.710> board<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:27.630> know<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
something on a magnet board you know and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
something on a magnet board you know and
so<00:02:28.110> there's<00:02:28.320> maybe<00:02:28.560> yeah<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.580> could<00:02:29.640> figure

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
so there's maybe yeah if I could figure

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.080 
so there's maybe yeah if I could figure
out<00:02:30.000> how<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.980> maybe<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.100> could<00:02:32.190> offer

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
out how to do that maybe I could offer

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.750 
out how to do that maybe I could offer
that<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.840> an<00:02:33.960> option<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.920> people<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.760> found

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that as an option for people but I found

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
that as an option for people but I found
two<00:02:38.910> little<00:02:39.030> screws<00:02:39.390> work<00:02:39.990> old<00:02:40.590> screws<00:02:40.920> work

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
two little screws work old screws work

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.400 
two little screws work old screws work
really<00:02:41.430> well<00:02:41.670> at<00:02:42.630> moving<00:02:43.020> things<00:02:43.230> around

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
really well at moving things around

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.990 
really well at moving things around
pretty<00:02:44.310> much<00:02:45.170> but<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> idea<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
pretty much but the idea is that you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.560 
pretty much but the idea is that you
move<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.300> around<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.030> why<00:02:51.300> I'd

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
move them around and I can see why I'd

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.470 
move them around and I can see why I'd
like<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> pre-configured<00:02:52.740> kitchen

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
like to have a pre-configured kitchen

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.210 
like to have a pre-configured kitchen
because<00:02:54.480> moving<00:02:54.840> these<00:02:55.140> these<00:02:55.800> little<00:02:56.010> guys

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
because moving these these little guys

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.510 
because moving these these little guys
around<00:02:56.640> us<00:02:56.850> tough<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.920> might<00:02:59.160> even<00:02:59.340> try

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
around us tough and you might even try

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.130 
around us tough and you might even try
using<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.420> tape<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.950> hold<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.610> place

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
using little tape to hold them in place

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.990 
using little tape to hold them in place
once<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.530> something<00:03:04.830> like<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.430> bathroom

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
once you get something like the bathroom

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.740 
once you get something like the bathroom
in<00:03:06.210> place<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.070> know<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:09.600> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
in place you know that you know that you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.809 
in place you know that you know that you
know<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:09.990> want<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.410> keep<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.980> spot

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.429 

so<00:03:17.360> I'm<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.540> gonna<00:03:17.659> do<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:17.900> kind<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.200> quick

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
so I'm just gonna do this kind of quick

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.830 
so I'm just gonna do this kind of quick
so<00:03:18.470> don't<00:03:18.830> worry<00:03:19.010> yeah<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.549> get<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> idea

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.360 

someone<00:03:23.840> asked<00:03:24.079> me<00:03:24.170> what<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.349> scale<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:24.829> and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
someone asked me what the scale is and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.339 
someone asked me what the scale is and
you<00:03:25.430> know<00:03:25.549> when<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.060> printed<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.599> I<00:03:26.750> don't<00:03:27.170> think

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
you know when I printed it I don't think

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.630 
you know when I printed it I don't think
I<00:03:27.409> selected<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.269> scale<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.040> may<00:03:31.459> do

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
I selected a scale I think I I may do

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.240 
I selected a scale I think I I may do
that<00:03:31.670> in<00:03:31.939> subsequent<00:03:32.299> versions<00:03:32.870> but<00:03:33.799> each<00:03:34.040> one

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
that in subsequent versions but each one

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.380 
that in subsequent versions but each one
of<00:03:34.340> these<00:03:34.400> little<00:03:34.670> squares<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.569> 2x2<00:03:36.409> feet

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
of these little squares is 2x2 feet

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.600 
of these little squares is 2x2 feet
ants<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> rough<00:03:39.260> interior<00:03:40.010> dimensions

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
ants and the rough interior dimensions

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.170 
ants and the rough interior dimensions
of<00:03:40.879> this<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.599> about<00:03:41.959> 8<00:03:42.170> by<00:03:42.319> 20<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:43.760> actually<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
of this is about 8 by 20 it's actually a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.550 
of this is about 8 by 20 it's actually a
little<00:03:44.420> bit<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.670> inside<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:50.560> so

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
little bit on the inside of that but so

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.339 
little bit on the inside of that but so
I<00:03:51.590> think<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:52.040> get<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.280> idea<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:54.079> know<00:03:54.170> here's

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
I think you get the idea you know here's

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.160 
I think you get the idea you know here's
a<00:03:54.440> desk<00:03:54.680> here's<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.129> table<00:03:55.480> here's<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.569> sofa<00:03:56.989> bed

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
a desk here's a table here's a sofa bed

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.890 
a desk here's a table here's a sofa bed
a<00:03:57.680> little<00:03:57.889> round<00:03:58.250> table<00:03:58.489> some<00:03:59.000> upper<00:03:59.420> cabinets

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
a little round table some upper cabinets

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.580 
a little round table some upper cabinets
talking<00:04:00.470> it's<00:04:00.680> chairs<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.819> idea<00:04:02.090> is<00:04:02.180> that

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
talking it's chairs the idea is that

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.949 
talking it's chairs the idea is that
there's<00:04:03.590> only<00:04:03.889> so<00:04:04.040> much<00:04:04.340> room<00:04:04.400> inside<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:05.480> small

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
there's only so much room inside a small

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.520 
there's only so much room inside a small
space<00:04:06.260> and<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.780> every<00:04:08.780> time<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:09.170> choose<00:04:09.470> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
space and so every time you choose to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.729 
space and so every time you choose to
put<00:04:09.889> something<00:04:10.280> in<00:04:10.579> or<00:04:10.819> take<00:04:11.030> something<00:04:11.269> out

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
put something in or take something out

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.990 
put something in or take something out
you<00:04:12.739> know<00:04:12.829> you're<00:04:13.010> really<00:04:13.310> you're<00:04:13.970> really

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
you know you're really you're really

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.659 
you know you're really you're really
using<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:15.049> lot<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.349> what<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.519> available

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
using a lot of what you have available

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.300 
using a lot of what you have available
and<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.139> it<00:04:18.260> really<00:04:18.380> makes<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.829> think<00:04:19.039> about

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310
