would<00:00:36.360> win<00:00:36.570> because<00:00:37.430> even<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:38.640> did<00:00:38.850> go

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
would win because even if he did go

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.780 
would win because even if he did go
super<00:00:39.450> saiyan<00:00:39.649> he<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.890> overwhelmed<00:00:41.790> by

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
super saiyan he would be overwhelmed by

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
super saiyan he would be overwhelmed by
the<00:00:42.000> power<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.690> he<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:42.899> obtained<00:00:43.350> well

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the power that he has obtained well

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.729 
the power that he has obtained well
actually<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.149> Vegeta<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.140> probably

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
actually I think Vegeta would probably

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
actually I think Vegeta would probably
win<00:00:46.980> actually<00:00:47.520> no<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.420> fight<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
win actually no one in this fight I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
win actually no one in this fight I
think<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> jito<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:50.010> win<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> simple

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
think the jito would win for the simple

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
think the jito would win for the simple
fact<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.020> he's<00:00:52.680> much<00:00:52.980> more<00:00:53.250> ruthless<00:00:53.850> than

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
fact that he's much more ruthless than

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
fact that he's much more ruthless than
Goku<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.480> he's<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.680> relentless<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
Goku is he's much more relentless so I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
Goku is he's much more relentless so I
feel<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.719> vegeta<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.829> whatever<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
feel like vegeta would do whatever it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
feel like vegeta would do whatever it
would<00:00:59.850> take<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.840> him<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> completely<00:01:01.739> wipe

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
would take for him to completely wipe

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
would take for him to completely wipe
out<00:01:02.789> please<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> without<00:01:03.510> even<00:01:03.840> without<00:01:04.229> even

fighting and just battling it out so and
I<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:31.979> Frieza<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.060> give<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> Goku

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I mean Frieza really did give it to Goku

I mean Frieza really did give it to Goku
you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you know as much as he could but at the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.929 
you know as much as he could but at the
end<00:01:36.360> Goku<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.860> he<00:01:37.950> didn't<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.520> kill

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
end Goku one but he didn't really kill

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
end Goku one but he didn't really kill
freeze<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.479> he<00:01:39.630> let<00:01:39.810> him<00:01:39.840> live<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.189> mean<00:01:41.520> in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
freeze that he let him live on I mean in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.190 
freeze that he let him live on I mean in
this<00:01:41.820> case<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.420> Vegeta<00:01:42.990> would

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this case I think Vegeta would

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
this case I think Vegeta would
completely<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.009> say<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
completely just say you know what the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
completely just say you know what the
hell<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:44.970> damage<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.299> gonna<00:01:45.450> kill<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> once

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
hell with damage is gonna kill you once

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
hell with damage is gonna kill you once
and<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.939> who<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.090> guys<00:01:48.270> think

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and for all but who do you guys think

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819 
and for all but who do you guys think
would<00:01:48.720> win<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> mean<00:01:48.990> honestly<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> guys

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
would win I mean honestly do you guys

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.859 
would win I mean honestly do you guys
believe<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.369> Vegeta<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
believe that Vegeta would actually you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
believe that Vegeta would actually you
know<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.140> able<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> kill<00:01:52.680> Frieza<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.790> you

know be able to kill Frieza or do you
guys<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.420> freezing<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
guys think that freezing was just

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
guys think that freezing was just
overpower<00:01:55.649> Vegeta<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.340> every<00:01:56.670> single<00:01:56.850> way

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
overpower Vegeta in every single way

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240 
overpower Vegeta in every single way
possible<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.780> send<00:01:58.649> him<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> an

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
possible and just send him to an

below on who do you think would win this

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.370 
below on who do you think would win this
and<00:02:04.290> why<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> uh<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> looks<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and why but uh from the looks of this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.589 
and why but uh from the looks of this
fight<00:02:07.710> Vegeta<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.429> been<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> taking<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
fight Vegeta has been just taking it you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.570 
fight Vegeta has been just taking it you
know<00:02:09.720> left<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> believe<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
know left and right so I believe that

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
know left and right so I believe that
riza<00:02:12.300> doesn't<00:02:12.750> stand<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.050> chance<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.500> mean<00:02:13.650> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
riza doesn't stand a chance I mean but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.270 
riza doesn't stand a chance I mean but
then<00:02:13.890> again<00:02:14.040> Frieza<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:15.060> known<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.250> know

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
then again Frieza is known for you know

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580 
then again Frieza is known for you know
if<00:02:18.180> he<00:02:18.360> can't<00:02:18.660> kill<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.110> he'll<00:02:19.350> take<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
if he can't kill you he'll take the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.010 
if he can't kill you he'll take the
planet<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.630> you'll<00:02:21.630> take<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
planet that you are you'll take that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
planet that you are you'll take that
planet<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.120> he'll

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
planet with you you know he'll

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.690 
planet with you you know he'll
essentially<00:02:25.410> try<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> blow<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> planet<00:02:26.370> in

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
essentially try to blow up the planet in

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
essentially try to blow up the planet in
order<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.570> him<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.200> you're<00:02:28.800> dead

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
order for him to know that you're dead

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.020 
order for him to know that you're dead
once<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.330> mean<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.940> don't<00:02:32.940> know

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
once and for all but I mean I don't know

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
once and for all but I mean I don't know
it's<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.330> Vegeta<00:02:35.840> Vegeta<00:02:36.840> might<00:02:37.230> seem<00:02:37.680> like

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it's just Vegeta Vegeta might seem like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.850 
it's just Vegeta Vegeta might seem like
his<00:02:38.820> strength<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> his<00:02:39.810> newfound<00:02:40.230> power

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
his strength and his newfound power

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.570 
his strength and his newfound power
might<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.310> over<00:02:41.850> his<00:02:41.970> head<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.500> he<00:02:43.980> would<00:02:44.310> feel

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
might go over his head so he would feel

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.150 
might go over his head so he would feel
like<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.360> know<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.440> what<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.710> can<00:02:47.010> just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
like you know you know what I can just

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.940 
like you know you know what I can just
toy<00:02:47.490> with<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:48.200> yeah<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.530> what<00:02:51.950> that's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
toy with you yeah you know what that's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.820 
toy with you yeah you know what that's
what<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.190> believe<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.900> believe<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.470> Vegeta

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
what I believe I believe that Vegeta

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.100 
what I believe I believe that Vegeta
would<00:02:56.040> toy<00:02:56.310> around<00:02:56.459> Frieza<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.420> until<00:02:57.900> we're

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
would toy around Frieza up until we're

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.760 
would toy around Frieza up until we're
reason<00:02:59.070> will<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.730> pissed<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> point

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
reason will get so pissed to the point

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.650 
reason will get so pissed to the point
where<00:03:02.010> he'll<00:03:02.190> he'll<00:03:02.880> either<00:03:03.060> blow<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
where he'll he'll either blow up the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.490 
where he'll he'll either blow up the
planet<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:05.600> he'll<00:03:06.600> do<00:03:06.720> something<00:03:06.990> cuz<00:03:07.260> i<00:03:07.440> know

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
planet or he'll do something cuz i know

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.460 
planet or he'll do something cuz i know
for<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> fact<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.610> vegeta<00:03:09.540> would<00:03:09.690> probably

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
for a fact that vegeta would probably

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.560 
for a fact that vegeta would probably
toy<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.950> him<00:03:11.070> in<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.280> beginning<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.850> know

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
toy with him in the beginning you know

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.390 
toy with him in the beginning you know
just<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> see<00:03:13.110> where<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.440> stand<00:03:13.740> that<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.070> his

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
just to see where to stand that on his

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.560 
just to see where to stand that on his
level<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.850> whatnot<00:03:15.240> but<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.800> end<00:03:17.570> Frieza

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
level and whatnot but in the end Frieza

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.479 
level and whatnot but in the end Frieza
or<00:03:18.930> Vegeta<00:03:19.290> I'd<00:03:19.620> say<00:03:19.830> Vegeta<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:21.090> uh<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.900> know

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
or Vegeta I'd say Vegeta but uh you know

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.030 
or Vegeta I'd say Vegeta but uh you know
it's<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.720> very<00:03:24.959> sad<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:25.830> when

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
it's it's it's very sad to see when

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
it's it's it's very sad to see when
Frieza<00:03:26.310> came<00:03:26.580> back<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.940> GT<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.810> all

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
Frieza came back in GT and you know all

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.660 
Frieza came back in GT and you know all
these<00:03:28.170> other<00:03:28.350> episodes<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:28.920> he<00:03:29.040> got<00:03:29.190> beaten

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
these other episodes and he got beaten

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.729 
these other episodes and he got beaten
really<00:03:30.090> quickly<00:03:30.540> by<00:03:30.690> go<00:03:30.989> through<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.440> whatnot

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
really quickly by go through and whatnot

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.930 
really quickly by go through and whatnot
I<00:03:31.769> mean<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:33.120> know<00:03:33.239> but<00:03:33.660> Vegeta<00:03:34.380> is

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
I mean just you know but Vegeta is

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.940 
I mean just you know but Vegeta is
relentless<00:03:35.940> Vegeta<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.650> unmerciful<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:37.800> so

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
relentless Vegeta is unmerciful but so

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.390 
relentless Vegeta is unmerciful but so
is<00:03:38.070> Frieza<00:03:39.050> but<00:03:40.050> in<00:03:40.320> terms<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.769> brute<00:03:41.160> strength

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
is Frieza but in terms of brute strength

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.940 
is Frieza but in terms of brute strength
I'd<00:03:42.120> say<00:03:43.340> Vegeta<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.610> terms<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.510> speed<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.320> don't

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
I'd say Vegeta in terms of speed I don't

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.259 
I'd say Vegeta in terms of speed I don't
know<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.220> might<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.610> little<00:03:47.790> tricky<00:03:48.239> i

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
know that might be a little tricky i

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.759 
know that might be a little tricky i
think<00:03:48.540> freeze<00:03:48.900> will<00:03:49.080> probably<00:03:49.320> get<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.470> one

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
think freeze will probably get that one

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.250 
think freeze will probably get that one
down<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.220> don't<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.700> then<00:03:50.880> again<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.150> could<00:03:51.660> use

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
down I don't know then again I could use

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.490 
down I don't know then again I could use
a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.470> quick<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.220> um<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:54.870> terms<00:03:55.140> of

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
a little quick to so um in terms of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
a little quick to so um in terms of
charging<00:03:56.070> their<00:03:56.250> key<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.760> think<00:03:57.180> freezer<00:03:57.480> would

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
charging their key I think freezer would

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.150 
charging their key I think freezer would
win<00:03:57.840> on<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:58.380> then<00:03:58.769> again<00:03:58.890> I'm<00:03:59.130> not

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
win on that but then again I'm not
