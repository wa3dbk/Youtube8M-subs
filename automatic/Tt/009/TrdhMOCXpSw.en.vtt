00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 what wind strong mops them still can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.810
 call for help commands like here 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.130
 let's 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.130
 this here is the command, you can change 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:56.190
 a value of 10 he will still 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:01:00.980
 can generally bridges felicita 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.980

 added everything ford took looks like 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.970
 boat but this is a surfboard 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.969
 here to eliminate you can eat 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.770
 and nothing can be done with it 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:34.700
 nothing is lost so just let it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.600
 Yes there is still a need to add the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.619
 siren sitting commodity container dmitry 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.679
 adam with you tones and some kind of siren 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.170
 special forces and yes add 4 thread 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.630
 still this pop this 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.539
 and dark I am not helping to cause a tornado 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 future all sorts of different things let's 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:05.649
 here are the parties saw friends let's not 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.200
 warm gun what is boeing and so here or 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.539
 to stew 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.470
 the fire serpent is shorter in its path 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.030
 will set fire 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.720
 Okey principle, everything is silk 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.180
 fighting 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 so he just flips the ground 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.269
 raises her to lonely 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.520
 I turn and if you try 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:36.390
 let's why germany 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.220
 and here you saw it raises the grass and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.970
 not hiding tears such a sapling 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.250
 and dry grass principle cool could 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.440
 generally very wing and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.440
 dry enter well see for yourself 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.860
 That saw it so I did not know what it is 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 you need to become and very mine minecraft 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 to the world of minecraft, you will have 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.360
 meet same cave or sometimes also 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.270
 it may happen but this phenomenon 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.090
 even like a tornado and and all that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.460
 showed the whole phenomenon they can by 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.510
 accidents 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.890
 happen never be play survival 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.100
 and what do you need to call a tornado now? 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.800
 yes, and vector3 we also add such a block 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.870
 affect and do not know why you can 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.500
 he click and just will not know 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.260
 why does it just grow a tree 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.980
 above, you will see the petals 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.000
 wind for the sand will fall 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.659
 don't know how to stop okay so 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.970
 it is but here's a tornado gun myself 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:01.310
 interesting in these vyzvanivayu 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:05.750
 who on the water so how to throw one 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.099
 put well let's 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.099
 that's how Elena played here 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.280
 moved not by the fact that the tornado series 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.100
 let's put this much quieter 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.400
 let's see and miracle actually robin 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.540
 and the taranda is literally sucking in everything 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.880
 water these blocks site you land here not 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.440
 tree foliage 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.500
 let's see how this is a textbook from the inside 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.290
 looks like 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.340
 much epic and if for example here 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.770
 let's try the creative movement a 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.770
 wish mode 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.990
 that's all now we have a little bit here 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:01.950
 pulls draws even though she is far away 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.950
 suck come on let's take a closer look 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.289
 his hour is now as it is 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.090
 near no 5 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.520
 how it looks like the result will not i 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.669
 I go this is lucky that I am water 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:22.509
 still there is a tornado weak without less 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.509
 does not represent itself 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.310
 so quickly all 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.920
 and now on such a tyranet psycho tacitly and 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.370
 with time these blocks disappear and they 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.580
 fly and then will fall out 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.390
 the finger itself is seen that is, here they are 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.780
 fall down and land on the ground right there 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:49.300
 well let's take a bigger tornado 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.300
 the biggest plus for which there is 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.659
 spawn 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.080
 here 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.949
 so yes 5 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.949
 oh kapets will 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.210
 here it is here it is the same tornado as 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:18.270
 it's just a lot more and she's straight 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.600
 more blocks pull out you see it 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.830
 the tornado has already disappeared automatically 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.140
 will launch biema 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.800
 and now produces only 5 it is necessary to 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.990
 much bigger and taller i'm straight 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:37.140
 literally all jar and greens and 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:39.580
 animal blocks all the air look 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:46.830
 what you need is formed you can put 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:46.830
 Selena sang 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.410
 in principle, this mod ends by 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.460
 which need not formed can 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.350
 low good prospects whether 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.930
 link to the mod will be in the description of the video 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.620
 that these descriptions will be there all principle 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:09.260
 all the information and what its awful 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:13.440
 thanks for seeing as always 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.630
 I repeat to everyone thanks for watching 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.420
