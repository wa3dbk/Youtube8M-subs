this thing actually has more pieces than

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.620 
this thing actually has more pieces than
I<00:01:17.140> thought<00:01:17.969> I'd<00:01:18.969> be<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> little<00:01:19.479> more

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
I thought I'd be a little more

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.630 
I thought I'd be a little more
complicated<00:01:20.109> to<00:01:20.499> put<00:01:20.679> together<00:01:20.950> than<00:01:21.399> I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
complicated to put together than I

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.520 
complicated to put together than I
originally<00:01:21.700> thought<00:01:22.030> but<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.200> still<00:01:23.319> not

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
originally thought but it's still not

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.609 
originally thought but it's still not
all<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:24.039> complicated<00:01:24.420> basically<00:01:25.420> 1<00:01:25.659> 2<00:01:25.990> 3<00:01:26.319> 3

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
all that complicated basically 1 2 3 3

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.419 
all that complicated basically 1 2 3 3
easy<00:01:26.950> steps

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
easy steps

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.130 
easy steps
it's<00:01:27.819> just<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.270> actually<00:01:28.600> got<00:01:28.719> more<00:01:28.869> pieces

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
it's just it's actually got more pieces

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.039 
it's just it's actually got more pieces
than<00:01:29.499> I<00:01:29.560> expected<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:31.420> what<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.780> looks<00:01:31.960> like

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
than I expected so is what it looks like

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.200 
than I expected so is what it looks like
and<00:01:32.670> tray<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.780> all<00:01:35.049> put<00:01:35.289> together<00:01:36.210> you'll

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
and tray it is all put together you'll

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.590 
and tray it is all put together you'll
see<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.539> assault<00:01:37.869> rifle<00:01:38.259> right<00:01:38.439> there<00:01:39.600> give

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.420 

I<00:01:54.640> gotta<00:01:55.640> be<00:01:55.790> honest<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:57.110> thing<00:01:57.380> isn't<00:01:58.070> as

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
I gotta be honest this thing isn't as

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.390 
I gotta be honest this thing isn't as
cool<00:01:59.240> as<00:01:59.690> I<00:02:00.430> hoped<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.610> would<00:02:01.730> be<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:04.190> by<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
cool as I hoped it would be and by the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400 
cool as I hoped it would be and by the
way<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.700> about<00:02:04.850> six<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.840> half<00:02:05.870> inches

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
way it's about six and a half inches

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.600 
way it's about six and a half inches
tall<00:02:06.620> so<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.070> even<00:02:07.340> seven<00:02:08.000> taller<00:02:08.210> than<00:02:08.510> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
tall so it's even seven taller than the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.070 
tall so it's even seven taller than the
McFarlane<00:02:10.610> figures<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:13.930> not<00:02:14.930> exactly

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080

it's kind of got not super articulation

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.100 
it's kind of got not super articulation
but<00:02:28.400> pretty<00:02:28.610> close<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.600> got<00:02:29.780> more<00:02:30.050> than

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
but pretty close it's it's got more than

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.310 
but pretty close it's it's got more than
than<00:02:30.890> basic<00:02:31.370> articulation<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.050> said

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
than basic articulation but like I said

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.770 
than basic articulation but like I said
it's<00:02:36.830> not<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> most<00:02:37.430> playable<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.420> kind<00:02:38.690> of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's not the most playable it's kind of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.450 
it's not the most playable it's kind of
soft<00:02:39.020> in<00:02:39.320> places<00:02:39.770> where<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.070> shouldn't<00:02:40.370> be

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
soft in places where it shouldn't be

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.670 
soft in places where it shouldn't be
like<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.450> points<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.840> articulation<00:02:41.990> as

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
like the the points of articulation as

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.460 
like the the points of articulation as
you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:42.890> see<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.700> wobbly<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:47.750> magnets

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
you can see it's wobbly these magnets

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.700 
you can see it's wobbly these magnets
aren't<00:02:48.710> as<00:02:49.130> strong<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:49.790> hope<00:02:50.030> they'd<00:02:50.330> be<00:02:50.710> if

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
aren't as strong as I hope they'd be if

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.260 
aren't as strong as I hope they'd be if
you're<00:02:51.950> playing<00:02:52.190> with<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.490> these<00:02:52.910> are<00:02:53.060> easy

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
you're playing with it these are easy

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.110 
you're playing with it these are easy
snap<00:02:53.600> easily<00:02:54.260> snap<00:02:54.860> off<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.700> mean<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.030> guess

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
snap easily snap off but I mean I guess

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.730 
snap easily snap off but I mean I guess
that<00:02:56.420> part's<00:02:56.750> understandable<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.620> when

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
that part's understandable and when

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.920 
that part's understandable and when
we've<00:02:57.860> got<00:02:58.040> parts<00:02:58.490> like<00:02:58.700> these<00:02:59.300> ball<00:02:59.570> joints

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
we've got parts like these ball joints

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.670 
we've got parts like these ball joints
right<00:03:00.110> here<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.490> hips<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:03.200> almost<00:03:03.470> like

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
right here and the hips it's almost like

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.150 
right here and the hips it's almost like
oh<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> ankles<00:03:05.900> too<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.980> almost

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
oh and in the ankles too it's almost

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.910 
oh and in the ankles too it's almost
like<00:03:07.340> why<00:03:07.610> even<00:03:07.640> bother<00:03:08.150> with<00:03:08.620> with<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.739> whole

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
like why even bother with with the whole

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.850 
like why even bother with with the whole
magnet<00:03:10.370> gimmick<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.970> only<00:03:11.209> one<00:03:12.140> two<00:03:12.410> three

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
magnet gimmick it's only one two three

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.620 
magnet gimmick it's only one two three
parts<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.370> there's<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.550> magnet<00:03:13.910> in<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> middle

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
parts and there's a magnet in the middle

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.050 
parts and there's a magnet in the middle
I<00:03:18.730> guess<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.970> affects<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:21.820> strength<00:03:22.820> of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
I guess that affects the strength of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
I guess that affects the strength of
this<00:03:23.209> magnet<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.780> don't<00:03:23.959> think<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.320> affects<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this magnet I don't think it affects the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.130 
this magnet I don't think it affects the
strength<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.450> ones<00:03:26.660> here<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:26.989> the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
strength of the ones here in the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.260 
strength of the ones here in the
shoulders<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.620> some<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.250> these<00:03:28.340> these<00:03:28.880> pieces

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
shoulders and some of these these pieces

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.830 
shoulders and some of these these pieces
of<00:03:29.510> armor<00:03:30.160> I'll<00:03:31.160> pop<00:03:31.430> off<00:03:31.670> fairly<00:03:32.360> easy<00:03:32.660> I

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
of armor I'll pop off fairly easy I

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.630 
of armor I'll pop off fairly easy I
would<00:03:33.110> have<00:03:33.230> thought<00:03:33.380> they<00:03:33.590> snapped<00:03:34.370> in

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
would have thought they snapped in

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.310 
would have thought they snapped in
really<00:03:35.510> tight<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.750> know<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.910> this

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
really tight so you know and this this

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.840 
really tight so you know and this this
waist<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.560> really<00:03:42.800> loose<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.220> don't<00:03:43.640> know<00:03:43.730> if

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
waist is really loose I don't know if

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.370 
waist is really loose I don't know if
it's<00:03:43.970> just<00:03:44.030> mine<00:03:44.390> like<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.720> said<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.260> my

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's just mine like I said this is my

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.440 
it's just mine like I said this is my
first<00:03:45.590> time<00:03:45.890> within<00:03:46.670> these<00:03:46.850> magnetic

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
first time within these magnetic

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.400 
first time within these magnetic
Spartans<00:03:49.570> some<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.750> proportions<00:03:51.080> are

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
Spartans some of the proportions are

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.530 
Spartans some of the proportions are
weird<00:03:51.650> too<00:03:51.890> like<00:03:52.250> overall<00:03:52.730> it's<00:03:52.850> got<00:03:53.030> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
weird too like overall it's got the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.660 
weird too like overall it's got the
proportions<00:03:54.200> are<00:03:54.350> okay<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.190> hands

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
proportions are okay but then the hands

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.130 
proportions are okay but then the hands
and<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.360> feet<00:03:56.570> kind<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.410> seem<00:03:57.620> too<00:03:57.800> small

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
and the feet kind of seem too small

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.479 
and the feet kind of seem too small
the<00:04:00.560> hands<00:04:00.799> are<00:04:00.890> nicely<00:04:01.220> because<00:04:01.310> they're

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
the hands are nicely because they're

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.240 
the hands are nicely because they're
made<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.940> softer<00:04:02.359> softer<00:04:02.690> plastic<00:04:03.500> almost

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
made of a softer softer plastic almost

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.420 
made of a softer softer plastic almost
rubbery<00:04:04.459> or<00:04:04.850> it<00:04:05.239> is

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
rubbery or it is

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.160 
rubbery or it is
rubbery<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:06.359> you<00:04:06.420> know<00:04:06.629> you<00:04:06.719> can<00:04:06.840> grip<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
rubbery so you know you can grip the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.860 
rubbery so you know you can grip the
weapons<00:04:07.939> wouldn't<00:04:08.939> really<00:04:09.090> recommend<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
weapons wouldn't really recommend this

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
weapons wouldn't really recommend this
one<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.769> still<00:04:11.040> cool<00:04:13.579> it<00:04:14.579> makes<00:04:14.790> an<00:04:14.909> okay

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
one it's still cool it makes an okay

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.439 
one it's still cool it makes an okay
display<00:04:16.199> figure<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.769> mean<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.090> one<00:04:18.329> in

display figure I mean and this one in
particular<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:19.079> probably<00:04:19.380> wouldn't<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:19.889> any

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.520 
particular I probably wouldn't get any
of<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.220> others<00:04:20.549> honestly<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.320> fact

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
of the others honestly but just the fact

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.980 
of the others honestly but just the fact
that<00:04:22.620> this<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.949> an<00:04:23.070> active<00:04:23.430> camel<00:04:23.880> one<00:04:24.060> you

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
that this is an active camel one you

that this is an active camel one you
know<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.350> mean<00:04:25.650> come<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.100> active<00:04:26.370> camel

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699

know I mean come on the active camel
ones<00:04:26.820> always<00:04:27.300> look<00:04:27.479> cool<00:04:27.770> honestly<00:04:28.770> I

ones always look cool honestly I

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.810 
ones always look cool honestly I
would've<00:04:30.660> liked<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.320> much<00:04:31.500> better<00:04:31.820> almost

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
would've liked it much better almost

would've liked it much better almost
everything<00:04:33.360> else<00:04:34.130> would<00:04:35.130> be<00:04:35.160> forgivable<00:04:35.820> for

me if instead of the the whole magnet
can<00:04:41.310> make<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.639> would<00:04:41.729> have<00:04:41.849> just<00:04:42.000> been<00:04:42.060> ball

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
can make it would have just been ball

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.520 
can make it would have just been ball
joints<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.840> know<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.199> kind<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.500> a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
joints you know so it's kind of like a

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.909 
joints you know so it's kind of like a
buildable<00:04:43.919> action<00:04:44.430> figure<00:04:45.500> take<00:04:46.500> away<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
buildable action figure take away the

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.999 
buildable action figure take away the
magnet<00:04:47.340> gimmick<00:04:47.900> put<00:04:48.900> ball<00:04:49.080> joints<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.979> know

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
magnet gimmick put ball joints you know

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.430 
magnet gimmick put ball joints you know
all<00:04:50.789> those<00:04:51.150> parts<00:04:51.509> would<00:04:51.630> snap<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.259> ball

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
all those parts would snap in and ball

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.110 
all those parts would snap in and ball
joints<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:53.070> this<00:04:53.550> would<00:04:53.699> be<00:04:53.789> a<00:04:53.820> cold

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
joints and this would be a cold

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.159 
joints and this would be a cold
buildable<00:04:54.539> action<00:04:54.990> figure<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:57.090> yeah<00:04:57.810> that's

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
buildable action figure so yeah that's

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.300 
buildable action figure so yeah that's
just<00:04:58.259> me<00:04:58.590> okay<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.580> helmet<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.180> removable<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
just me okay the helmet is removable and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.820 
just me okay the helmet is removable and
something<00:05:02.310> worth<00:05:02.520> noting<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:04.560> head

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
something worth noting the head

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.339 
something worth noting the head
underneath<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.610> thing<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:06.840> kind<00:05:07.259> of

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
underneath this thing it's kind of

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.339 
underneath this thing it's kind of
robotic<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:08.340> instead<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.880> resembling<00:05:09.539> like<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
robotic it instead of resembling like a

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.050 
robotic it instead of resembling like a
human<00:05:11.250> face<00:05:11.460> its<00:05:11.849> robotic<00:05:12.830> almost<00:05:13.830> like<00:05:13.979> a

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
human face its robotic almost like a

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.010 
human face its robotic almost like a
terminator<00:05:15.590> endoskeleton<00:05:17.599> so<00:05:18.599> that's<00:05:18.810> kind

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
terminator endoskeleton so that's kind

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.379 
terminator endoskeleton so that's kind
of<00:05:19.080> interesting

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
of interesting

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.659 
of interesting
look<00:05:21.389> how<00:05:21.510> crystal<00:05:22.080> like<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.530> assault<00:05:23.190> rifle

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
look how crystal like the assault rifle

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.270 
look how crystal like the assault rifle
looks<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.539> wish<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.320> rest<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.770> plastic

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
looks I wish the rest of the plastic

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.930 
looks I wish the rest of the plastic
would<00:05:26.490> be<00:05:26.729> that<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:28.110> clear<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.430> head<00:05:29.639> just

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
would be that that clear the head just

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.860 
would be that that clear the head just
that<00:05:30.180> looks<00:05:30.510> sweet<00:05:31.430> final<00:05:32.430> verdict<00:05:32.789> I'm<00:05:33.599> gonna

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
that looks sweet final verdict I'm gonna

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.620 
that looks sweet final verdict I'm gonna

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
but the playability isn't there and I am

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.499 
but the playability isn't there and I am
about<00:05:56.639> playability

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
about playability

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.610 
about playability
either<00:05:58.320> way<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.800> does<00:05:59.580> look<00:05:59.820> cool<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:00.810> it's
