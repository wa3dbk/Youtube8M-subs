00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.940
 recruits appreciate show my new micro 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:13.119
 Now she is a puzzle that's quite 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:18.350
 Anton has two parts not black 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:20.600
 here is one white author reds in what 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.420
 the joke of this head can be solved by two 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.690
 ways 1 lighter different by 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.580
 harder and there will be more stages in it 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:36.379
 in this way here is the first way he 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:42.469
 generally the easiest consists of two 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:44.749
 action here are two stages the most 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.809
 the simplest of my heads 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:54.440
 do you need to stupidly turn this 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:01:00.729
 details here and pull now 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.729
 so here you can do and turn and 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.729
 push through 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:19.780
 fully now I will pull out tight-tight tight 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.780
 very tight these parts are pulled out 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.759
 why there seems to be a void inside 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 finally did the second action a 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.429
 no, it consists of 3 stages 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.259
 of the three actions that is right now 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:41.720
 will be the second action she is with us 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:50.560
 is to take this one 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.560
 white it 's not her back here 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:05.869
 totally can't i hurt now i 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.630
 I will obviously try a little here 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:16.090
 pull here so I pulled out and last 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:24.530
 the action is just stupid and and break off 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:30.410
 here the block is blocking here we broke off this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.049
 here here and let's see 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.299
 second way as i told you 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:42.980
 harder but it consists of four there or 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.600
 out of the 5 stages now calculate the same 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.760
 second way to tell 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.530
 the first action is to get out of here 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.579
 pick up item 2 for 2nd 21 from here 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.079
 shawls contour surface somehow 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.049
 to name 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:08.049
 the second action is to pull this one 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:11.560
 white detail right to shorter 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.780
 the next action is to shove 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.890
 black detail inside this hole 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.490
 which was formed 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.810
 here we thrust from the other side u 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.810
 vylazit us such a red part 11 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.190
 what's next you need to break off this one 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.730
 the detail that was there to the top what are you 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.880
 hooked now there is emptiness 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.400
 This is the only one 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:52.360
 action is just this we already have 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:56.440
 It turned out 1 2 3 4 and 10 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.600
 5 5 action power turn this one 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.920
 detail here and so this way and 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:10.110
 the sixth step pick up the detail 100 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:14.709
 dollars in general is such a puzzle 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.739
