00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
MacBook Air and you can get a feel for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.650 
MacBook Air and you can get a feel for
how<00:00:53.340> thin<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.890> yeah<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.400> is<00:00:59.449> this<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
how thin it is yeah there it is this is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.600 
how thin it is yeah there it is this is
what<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.900> looks<00:01:01.110> like<00:01:03.019> incredible

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.070 

it's<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.420> world's<00:01:07.900> thinnest<00:01:08.320> notebook<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
it's the world's thinnest notebook you

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.860 
it's the world's thinnest notebook you
open<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.470> up<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.610> got<00:01:12.730> a<00:01:12.760> magnetic<00:01:13.300> latch<00:01:13.540> so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
open it up it's got a magnetic latch so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.570 
open it up it's got a magnetic latch so
there's<00:01:14.050> no<00:01:14.200> hooks<00:01:14.530> or<00:01:14.800> things<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.160> catch<00:01:15.370> on

what<00:01:26.920> they<00:01:27.040> are<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.430> let<00:01:27.550> me<00:01:27.640> run<00:01:27.790> through<00:01:27.940> them

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
what they are so let me run through them

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.930 
what they are so let me run through them
with<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.330> now<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.840> want<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.020> rotate<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> photo

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
with you now you want to rotate a photo

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
with you now you want to rotate a photo
this<00:01:30.940> works<00:01:31.210> in<00:01:31.420> iPhoto<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.050> all<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.410> other

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
this works in iPhoto and all the other

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.820 
this works in iPhoto and all the other
photo<00:01:32.800> apps<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.610> rotate<00:01:34.090> like<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.830> again

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
photo apps just rotate like this again

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.140 
photo apps just rotate like this again
we've<00:01:36.010> taken<00:01:36.250> some<00:01:36.520> of<00:01:36.550> these<00:01:36.700> things<00:01:36.970> we

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
we've taken some of these things we

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.300 
we've taken some of these things we
learned<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.720> iPhone<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.500> now<00:01:38.650> we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
learned in the iPhone and now we're

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.480 
learned in the iPhone and now we're
putting<00:01:39.580> them<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.940> our<00:01:40.120> notebook<00:01:40.510> computer

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
putting them in our notebook computer

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.380 
putting them in our notebook computer
0.6<00:01:42.490> gigahertz<00:01:42.940> standard<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.080> there's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
0.6 gigahertz standard and there's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.420 
0.6 gigahertz standard and there's

right<00:01:49.330> into<00:01:49.720> MacBook<00:01:50.140> Air<00:01:50.640> along<00:01:51.640> with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
right into MacBook Air along with

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.500 
right into MacBook Air along with
Bluetooth<00:01:53.110> 2.1<00:01:53.910> processor<00:01:54.910> it's<00:01:55.090> what<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:55.330> use

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
Bluetooth 2.1 processor it's what we use

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.340 
Bluetooth 2.1 processor it's what we use
but<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.440> real<00:01:56.619> magic<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.460> electronics

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but the real magic is in the electronics

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.920 
but the real magic is in the electronics
this<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> complete<00:02:00.430> Mac<00:02:00.760> on<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> board<00:02:01.390> let's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
this is a complete Mac on a board let's

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.140 
this is a complete Mac on a board let's
take<00:02:02.110> off<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.470> cooling<00:02:02.890> system<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:04.030> a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
take off the cooling system that's a

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.120 
take off the cooling system that's a
complete<00:02:04.690> Mac<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.500> board<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:05.979> think

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
complete Mac on this board and you think

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.850 
complete Mac on this board and you think
well<00:02:06.280> okay<00:02:06.640> what's<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:06.970> special<00:02:07.240> about<00:02:07.450> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
well okay what's so special about that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.910 
well okay what's so special about that
well<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.010> is<00:02:09.130> how<00:02:09.250> big<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.490> board<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:10.920> it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
well this is how big the board is it's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.140 
well this is how big the board is it's
really<00:02:12.550> tiny<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:14.080> didn't<00:02:14.880> compromise<00:02:15.880> on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
really tiny and we didn't compromise on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.870 
really tiny and we didn't compromise on
performance
