now<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> saturator<00:00:11.280> pedal<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
now the saturator pedal is a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
now the saturator pedal is a
collaboration<00:00:12.450> between<00:00:12.660> joe<00:00:13.200> satriani<00:00:13.440> and

essentially it is Joe's sound in one box
it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> distortion<00:00:21.840> pedal<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it is a distortion pedal with a lot of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
it is a distortion pedal with a lot of
nifty<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.269> features<00:00:24.630> built<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.560> let's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
nifty little features built in so let's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.560 
nifty little features built in so let's
take<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> closer<00:00:26.189> look

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
take a closer look

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.690 
take a closer look
the<00:00:27.960> saturator<00:00:28.410> pedal<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> labor<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> love

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
the saturator pedal is a labor of love

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.750 
the saturator pedal is a labor of love
for<00:00:30.240> Joe<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.780> is<00:00:31.290> his<00:00:31.590> sound<00:00:31.860> in<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.220> box<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
for Joe it is his sound in one box as I

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.220 
for Joe it is his sound in one box as I
said<00:00:32.940> before<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.840> has<00:00:33.990> some

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
said before and it has some

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
said before and it has some
specifications<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.340> he<00:00:35.670> wanted<00:00:36.090> which

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
specifications that he wanted which

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.080 
specifications that he wanted which
really<00:00:37.020> make<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.350> pedal<00:00:37.680> interesting<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
really make this pedal interesting the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.700 
really make this pedal interesting the
saturator<00:00:39.510> has<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.900> essential<00:00:40.290> controls

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
saturator has all the essential controls

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
saturator has all the essential controls
of<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> distortion<00:00:41.520> pedal<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.180> game<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.720> tone

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of a distortion pedal the game the tone

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590 
of a distortion pedal the game the tone
and<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> volume<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> inclusion<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
and the volume with the inclusion of a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.170 
and the volume with the inclusion of a
pad<00:00:45.989> mini<00:00:46.410> toggle<00:00:46.830> over<00:00:46.949> here<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.879> great

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
pad mini toggle over here which is great

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
pad mini toggle over here which is great
because<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> hidden<00:00:49.470> between<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because it's kind of hidden between the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.710 
because it's kind of hidden between the
two<00:00:50.070> knobs<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.550> your<00:00:50.730> foot<00:00:50.970> won't<00:00:51.090> lop<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.449> off

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
two knobs so your foot won't lop it off

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.220 
two knobs so your foot won't lop it off
and<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.800> basically<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.670> on/off<00:00:53.910> switch

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and it basically is an on/off switch

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.890 
and it basically is an on/off switch
which<00:00:55.230> allows<00:00:55.370> other<00:00:56.449> pedals<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.750> are

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
which allows other pedals that which are

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.860 
which allows other pedals that which are
placed<00:00:58.140> before<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:59.550> saturator<00:01:00.210> such<00:01:00.479> as<00:01:00.659> like

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
placed before the saturator such as like

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.770 
placed before the saturator such as like
wah<00:01:01.710> pedals<00:01:02.220> and<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.729> high<00:01:02.970> gain<00:01:03.210> devices

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
wah pedals and other high gain devices

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
wah pedals and other high gain devices
so<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> won't<00:01:04.409> lose<00:01:04.650> any<00:01:05.040> tone<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.330> now

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so you won't lose any tone so right now

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.760 
so you won't lose any tone so right now
I<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:06.720> off<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.440> nothing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
I have it off because I have nothing

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.590 
I have it off because I have nothing
else<00:01:07.830> plugged<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.760> were<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.360> use

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
else plugged in but if you were to use

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
else plugged in but if you were to use
it<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:10.380> other<00:01:10.560> pedals<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.210> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it with other pedals you would put it in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.360 
it with other pedals you would put it in
the<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> position<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.799> may<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> off

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
the on position or you may like it off

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.000 
the on position or you may like it off
who<00:01:14.940> knows<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:16.260> great<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.620> about<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
who knows the great thing about the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.120 
who knows the great thing about the
saturator<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:18.060> has<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.510> more<00:01:18.840> switch<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
saturator is it has a more switch so the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.789 
saturator is it has a more switch so the
more<00:01:20.610> switch<00:01:20.820> acts<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.510> ways<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.770> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
more switch acts in two ways right now I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.850 
more switch acts in two ways right now I
have<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.190> gain<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.909> half<00:01:24.210> way<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.860> what

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
have the gain at about half way so what

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.030 
have the gain at about half way so what
it<00:01:25.979> does<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.670> if<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.090> wanted<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.780> gain<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.409> would

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it does is if I wanted more gain I would

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
it does is if I wanted more gain I would
just<00:01:29.190> hit<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.060> switch<00:01:30.360> obviously<00:01:31.260> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just hit the more switch obviously and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
just hit the more switch obviously and
it<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.070> basically<00:01:32.250> take<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.730> pedal<00:01:33.000> from

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it will basically take the pedal from

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.560 
it will basically take the pedal from
here<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.230> here<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.330> two

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
here to here so basically I get two

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.500 
here to here so basically I get two
different<00:01:36.720> distortion<00:01:37.380> sounds<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.820> pedal

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
different distortion sounds in one pedal

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.260 
different distortion sounds in one pedal
which<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.320> cool<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.550> other<00:01:41.670> thing<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
which is really cool the other thing is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.720 
which is really cool the other thing is
if<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.540> already<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> gain<00:01:43.710> done<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
if I already have the gain done and I

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.350 
if I already have the gain done and I
added<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.570> switch<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.290> adds<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:47.330> bit<00:01:48.330> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
added the more switch it adds a bit of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.720 
added the more switch it adds a bit of
harmonics<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.350> signal<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.340> really

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
harmonics to the signal so it really

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.010 
harmonics to the signal so it really
shines<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.420> lead<00:01:51.630> playing<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.200> top<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
shines for lead playing on top of it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.260 
shines for lead playing on top of it
finally<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.010> saturator<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.760> built<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.240> last

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
finally the saturator is built to last

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.870 
finally the saturator is built to last
this<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.930> heavy-duty<00:01:57.380> pedal<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.310> looks

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
this is a heavy-duty pedal and looks

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.880 
this is a heavy-duty pedal and looks
like<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.060> boutique<00:01:59.479> pedal<00:01:59.840> and<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.500> toggle

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
like a boutique pedal and this toggle

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.109 
like a boutique pedal and this toggle
switches<00:02:01.250> here<00:02:01.490> are<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:01.729> your<00:02:01.880> standard

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
switches here are not your standard

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.899 
switches here are not your standard
toggle<00:02:03.110> switches<00:02:03.260> they're<00:02:03.500> silent<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.400> you

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
toggle switches they're silent so you

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.399 
toggle switches they're silent so you
can<00:02:05.060> really<00:02:05.330> feel<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.690> when<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.869> activate<00:02:06.380> it

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
can really feel it when you activate it

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.710 
can really feel it when you activate it
now<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.460> Morse<00:02:07.820> which<00:02:08.030> as<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.270> said<00:02:08.330> only

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
now the Morse which as I said only

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.240 
now the Morse which as I said only
affects<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> gain<00:02:09.470> has<00:02:09.679> nothing<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.009> do<00:02:10.160> with

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
affects the gain has nothing to do with

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.520 
affects the gain has nothing to do with
the<00:02:10.369> tone<00:02:10.580> or<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.030> volume<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:12.200> course<00:02:12.440> you

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the tone or the volume and of course you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.670 
the tone or the volume and of course you
have<00:02:12.650> your<00:02:12.800> standard<00:02:13.220> on/off<00:02:14.030> switch<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.080> you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
have your standard on/off switch and you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.040 
have your standard on/off switch and you
can<00:02:15.830> tell<00:02:16.069> whether<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.940> pedals<00:02:17.209> on<00:02:17.360> or<00:02:17.660> your

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
can tell whether the pedals on or your

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.220 
can tell whether the pedals on or your
more<00:02:18.230> switches<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:19.360> that's<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.600> let's<00:02:20.959> take<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
more switches on that's it let's take a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.010 
more switches on that's it let's take a
listen<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.100> pedal<00:02:22.720> now<00:02:23.720> interestingly

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
listen to this pedal now interestingly

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.400 
listen to this pedal now interestingly
enough<00:02:24.530> Joe<00:02:25.489> uses<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.450> pedal<00:02:26.810> as<00:02:26.959> his<00:02:27.110> main

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
enough Joe uses this pedal as his main

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.770 
enough Joe uses this pedal as his main
distortion<00:02:28.130> sound<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.700> he<00:02:29.180> basically<00:02:29.510> runs

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
distortion sound so he basically runs

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.800 
distortion sound so he basically runs
his<00:02:30.019> pedal<00:02:30.320> into<00:02:30.500> his<00:02:30.980> clean<00:02:31.400> amp<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.330> here's

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
his pedal into his clean amp so here's

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.060 
his pedal into his clean amp so here's
my<00:02:33.080> clean<00:02:33.410> sound<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:38.380> now<00:02:39.380> let's<00:02:39.680> activate

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
my clean sound and now let's activate

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.640 
my clean sound and now let's activate
the<00:02:40.519> pedal<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.989> can<00:02:42.110> see<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.500> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
the pedal and you can see I have the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:03:02.340 
the pedal and you can see I have the
gain<00:02:42.830> halfway<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:45.590> we<00:02:45.680> go

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:29.959 

you

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:29.969 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.099 

sticking<00:03:30.969> with<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.180> same<00:03:31.450> sound<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:32.049> I'm

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
sticking with that same sound what I'm

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.899 
sticking with that same sound what I'm
going<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.379> is<00:03:32.469> activate<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:33.219> Morse<00:03:33.549> which

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
going to do is activate the Morse which

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.199 
going to do is activate the Morse which
and<00:03:34.239> basically<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.230> game<00:03:35.560> will<00:03:35.889> bump<00:03:36.129> up<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.939> a

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
and basically the game will bump up to a

00:03:37.209 --> 00:04:25.600 
and basically the game will bump up to a
solo<00:03:37.930> type<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.650> gain<00:03:38.889> here<00:03:39.249> we<00:03:39.370> go

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.560 

another<00:04:26.610> thing<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.000> should<00:04:27.030> mention<00:04:27.210> about

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
another thing I should mention about

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.800 
another thing I should mention about
this<00:04:27.750> pedal<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.260> Joe<00:04:28.560> is<00:04:28.710> very<00:04:29.040> much

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
this pedal that Joe is very much

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.540 
this pedal that Joe is very much
hands-on<00:04:30.810> about<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.980> fact<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.340> this

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
hands-on about is the fact that this

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.940 
hands-on about is the fact that this
pedal<00:04:32.850> really<00:04:33.270> cleans<00:04:33.540> up<00:04:33.750> when<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.590> lower

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
pedal really cleans up when you lower

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.070 
pedal really cleans up when you lower
your<00:04:35.220> volume<00:04:35.400> knob<00:04:35.850> which<00:04:36.090> he<00:04:36.270> does<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.510> lot<00:04:36.750> so

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
your volume knob which he does a lot so

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:46.070 
your volume knob which he does a lot so
here<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.740> am<00:04:37.860> at<00:04:38.280> 10

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.500 

Oh

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:05:12.170 

you

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.190 

now<00:05:13.180> let's<00:05:13.420> do<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.630> other<00:05:13.750> thing<00:05:13.960> which<00:05:14.080> I've

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
now let's do the other thing which I've

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.870 
now let's do the other thing which I've
mentioned<00:05:14.530> about<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.830> pedal<00:05:15.130> let's<00:05:15.400> turn<00:05:15.670> the

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
mentioned about the pedal let's turn the

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.500 
mentioned about the pedal let's turn the
gain<00:05:16.090> all<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.780> way<00:05:16.900> up<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:18.120> take<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.150> listen<00:05:19.360> to

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
gain all the way up and take a listen to

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.640 
gain all the way up and take a listen to
that<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:19.930> what<00:05:20.080> I'm<00:05:20.170> going<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.320> do<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.530> I'll

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
that and what I'm going to do is I'll

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.350 
that and what I'm going to do is I'll
engage<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.310> more<00:05:21.550> switch<00:05:21.850> so<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.240> hear

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
engage the more switch so you can hear

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.200 
engage the more switch so you can hear
how<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:23.110> harmonics<00:05:23.820> harmonic<00:05:24.820> content

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
how the harmonics harmonic content

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.330 
how the harmonics harmonic content
changes<00:05:25.810> on<00:05:26.020> this<00:05:26.200> pedal<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.830> let's<00:05:27.160> take<00:05:27.310> a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
changes on this pedal so let's take a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:06:21.340 
changes on this pedal so let's take a
listen

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.350 

the<00:06:22.350> brand-new<00:06:22.680> saturator<00:06:23.430> pedal<00:06:23.729> from<00:06:23.910> vox

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
the brand-new saturator pedal from vox

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.050 
the brand-new saturator pedal from vox
is<00:06:24.690> one<00:06:25.169> smooth<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.919> dynamic<00:06:26.490> distortion

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
is one smooth and dynamic distortion

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.820 
is one smooth and dynamic distortion
pedal<00:06:27.360> it's<00:06:27.570> one<00:06:27.810> of<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:27.990> best<00:06:28.259> out<00:06:28.470> there

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
pedal it's one of the best out there

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.490 
pedal it's one of the best out there
check<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.280> out
