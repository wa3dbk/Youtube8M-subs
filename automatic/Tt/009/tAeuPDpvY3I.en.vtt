00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.589
 hi people this blade I made donkey 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.440
 15 how could you understand this bearing 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.009
 did it for the brother who wanted it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.510
 see and that is exactly what i have series 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.100
 Butt on the butt with such a long chuyeva 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 but generally quite impressive 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.199
 sizes I will not measure there is more 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 some measuring devices just 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 for the ratio in some way 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 I put the palm of a large knife descent 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.410
 high enough turned out and concave 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 By the way the side of the butt did as well 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.219
 small introduction 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 as you can see in the butt blade 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.010
 about 4 millimeters 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 after the information left, well, about two 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 millimeters i.e. pao bokudo tip 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.899
 under the index finger as I said 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.829
 there is also sensed on the butt I became a place 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.690
 for thumb 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.350
 Speaking of handles, I want to note that she 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.449
 collected absolutely from different materials 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.780
 among which aluminum is such thin 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.010
 dice then dude by the way pay 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.979
 attention to how 11 looks after what 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.140
 follows lumii again 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.950
 textolite such a brownish tint 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.439
 then a reddish textolite 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.090
 textolite again the same and 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.930
 accordingly as you can see 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 then everything repeats again under 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.670
 scorch the notch characteristic of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.670
 in making everything in my case 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.110
 Comfortable in the hand even have such 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.360
 a small supply of handles knife will 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.660
 exploited about hunting needs 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.170
 or in nature what hatchet principle 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.410
 You can also use the calcium, by the way. 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 in oil and released over 4 hours 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.930
 at a temperature of 200 degrees 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 grinding reached the thousandth by the way extremely 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.869
 textolite is heavily processed very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.820
 reliable and practical for handles 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.950
 material adding someone wrote in 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.890
 comments that are not beautiful stuff 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.620
 for handles but 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.200
 believe me on the word he is very practical 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.740
 by the way notches on the butt case with 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.470
 Here is such a Bulgarians och direct ska and 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.780
 then polished them so wait 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.290
 Thank you all for watching place like 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.100
 if you like the blade or vice versa 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.100
