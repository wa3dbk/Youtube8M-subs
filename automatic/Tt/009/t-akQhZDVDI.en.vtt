00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
say what's on that card so you look at

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
say what's on that card so you look at
it<00:01:18.150> each<00:01:18.270> card<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.720> different<00:01:18.990> category<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it each card is a different category so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
it each card is a different category so
let's<00:01:20.250> say<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.400> example<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> one

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
let's say for example I think this one

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.750 
let's say for example I think this one
here<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.320> say<00:01:22.530> oh<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.800> an<00:01:22.890> orangutan<00:01:23.430> I'd

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
here and I say oh it's an orangutan I'd

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.030 
here and I say oh it's an orangutan I'd
then<00:01:23.910> turn<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> over<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:25.020> right<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> an

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
then turn it over I was right it is an

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.820 
then turn it over I was right it is an
orangutan<00:01:26.520> chip<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.420> me<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:28.440> someone

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
orangutan chip for me actually someone

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.200 
orangutan chip for me actually someone
else<00:01:28.890> look<00:01:29.160> it<00:01:29.250> turns<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.580> not<00:01:29.790> me<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
else look it turns it over not me and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.820 
else look it turns it over not me and
the<00:01:30.690> reason<00:01:30.899> someone<00:01:31.050> else<00:01:31.259> turns<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.560> over<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
the reason someone else turns it over is

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.050 
the reason someone else turns it over is
because<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> chance<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.910> answer

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because then I have a chance to answer

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
because then I have a chance to answer

don't answer the question correctly what

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.380 
don't answer the question correctly what
it<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.290> which<00:02:22.530> rarely<00:02:23.190> happens<00:02:23.459> B<00:02:24.000> since<00:02:24.239> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
it is which rarely happens B since you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.780 
it is which rarely happens B since you
can<00:02:24.600> choose<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.950> card<00:02:26.190> will<00:02:26.340> go<00:02:26.459> then

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
can choose then the card will go then

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.220 
can choose then the card will go then
the<00:02:27.120> next<00:02:27.360> person<00:02:27.630> has<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> chance<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.110> answer

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the next person has a chance to answer

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.740 
the next person has a chance to answer
the<00:02:28.380> card<00:02:28.590> correctly<00:02:28.920> etc<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> keep

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
the card correctly etc and you keep

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.910 
the card correctly etc and you keep
going<00:02:30.959> around<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.260> everyone<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.680> going

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
going around so everyone has going

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.610 
going around so everyone has going
around<00:02:32.160> 5<00:02:32.459> times<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.959> point<00:02:34.200> whereas

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
around 5 times and at that point whereas

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.729 
around 5 times and at that point whereas
most<00:02:34.799> chips<00:02:35.130> wins<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.850> before<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.049> count<00:02:37.560> up

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
most chips wins but before you count up

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.670 
most chips wins but before you count up
the<00:02:37.769> chips<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.340> people<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.510> set<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the chips if people have a set of the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
the chips if people have a set of the
same<00:02:40.890> color<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.730> three<00:02:42.269> cards<00:02:42.570> that

are all red I can turn those in for five

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.180 
are all red I can turn those in for five
points<00:02:45.209> four<00:02:45.480> cards<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.500> me<00:02:46.620> ten<00:02:46.799> points

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
into a few problems with it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.059 
into a few problems with it
one<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.330> replayability<00:03:16.080> obviously<00:03:16.860> once<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
one is replayability obviously once you

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.110 
one is replayability obviously once you
go<00:03:17.190> through<00:03:17.370> all<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> cards<00:03:17.880> you're<00:03:17.970> out

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
go through all the cards you're out

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.730 
go through all the cards you're out
that's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> problem<00:03:19.020> with<00:03:19.110> any<00:03:19.230> kind<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.440> trivia

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
that's a problem with any kind of trivia

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
that's a problem with any kind of trivia
game<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.700> not<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:20.850> it's<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> end<00:03:21.900> of

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
game so it's not that it's the end of

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.600 
game so it's not that it's the end of
the<00:03:22.080> world<00:03:22.290> here<00:03:22.590> there's<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.190> decent<00:03:23.520> amount

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
the world here there's a decent amount

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.760 
the world here there's a decent amount
of<00:03:23.790> questions<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> game<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:25.319> just<00:03:25.440> that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
of questions in the game it's just that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.190 
of questions in the game it's just that
you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.160> when<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.580> run<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:27.200> another

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
you know when you run out another

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.710 
you know when you run out another
problem<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.800> it's<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.100> little<00:03:29.450> kind<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.540> just

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
problem is it's a little kind of just

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.449 
problem is it's a little kind of just
all<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.230> board<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.980> don't<00:03:32.160> sometimes

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
all over the board you don't sometimes

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.160 
all over the board you don't sometimes
those<00:03:32.760> open-ended<00:03:33.090> questions<00:03:33.570> are<00:03:33.720> really

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
those open-ended questions are really
