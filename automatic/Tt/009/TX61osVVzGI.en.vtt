turns<00:02:14.840> collard<00:02:15.110> green<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.920> doesn't

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
turns collard green so that it doesn't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.550 
turns collard green so that it doesn't
have<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.519> manual<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.150> again<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.630> fairly<00:02:21.410> easy

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
have a manual but again it's fairly easy

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
have a manual but again it's fairly easy
to<00:02:21.830> use<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.700> figure<00:02:23.030> out<00:02:23.620> how<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.680> use<00:02:24.980> it
