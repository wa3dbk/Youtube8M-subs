to do is improve my anaerobic should I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
to do is improve my anaerobic should I
say<00:00:47.100> aerobic<00:00:48.410> power<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.760> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
say aerobic power so I have to work for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
say aerobic power so I have to work for
in<00:00:51.750> during<00:00:52.170> periods<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.219> today's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
in during periods like this today's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.119 
in during periods like this today's
three<00:00:53.879> hours<00:00:54.210> below<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.320> anaerobic<00:00:56.100> threshold

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
three hours below my anaerobic threshold

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.740 
three hours below my anaerobic threshold
I<00:00:56.899> could<00:00:57.899> touch<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.379> inner<00:00:58.530> upper<00:00:58.649> threshold

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
I could touch my inner upper threshold

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.910 
I could touch my inner upper threshold
and<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> slight<00:01:01.770> oxygen<00:01:02.430> deficit<00:01:02.910> possibly

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
and go to slight oxygen deficit possibly

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.899 
and go to slight oxygen deficit possibly
but<00:01:05.029> very<00:01:06.029> very<00:01:06.389> short<00:01:07.020> periods<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> bike

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
but very very short periods so the bike

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
but very very short periods so the bike
was<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.420> top<00:01:09.659> plastic

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.840 
working some other fibers related to the
whole<00:02:24.370> rotational<00:02:25.120> motion<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> cycling

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
whole rotational motion of the cycling

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.330 
whole rotational motion of the cycling
and<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.239> i'll<00:02:28.300> be<00:02:28.420> doing<00:02:28.540> uphill<00:02:29.380> gradient

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
and so i'll be doing uphill gradient

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.390 
and so i'll be doing uphill gradient
work<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:32.350> i'm<00:02:32.470> going<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> hope<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> average

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
work and i'm going to hope to average

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.979 
work and i'm going to hope to average
about<00:02:33.580> four<00:02:34.180> percent<00:02:34.330> gradient<00:02:34.989> for<00:02:36.989> three

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
about four percent gradient for three

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.860 
about four percent gradient for three
and<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.110> half<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.550> excuse<00:02:39.820> me<00:02:39.970> I'm<00:02:40.720> gonna

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
and a half but not excuse me I'm gonna

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.199 
and a half but not excuse me I'm gonna
hope<00:02:41.020> average<00:02:41.560> close<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> fifteen<00:02:42.880> percent

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
hope average close to fifteen percent

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.750 
hope average close to fifteen percent
gradient<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.930> four<00:02:44.140> miles<00:02:44.290> per<00:02:44.500> hour<00:02:44.760> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
gradient for four miles per hour that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.690 
gradient for four miles per hour that
should<00:02:45.970> yield<00:02:46.180> about<00:02:46.830> close<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.860> 2,500<00:02:48.640> feet

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
should yield about close to 2,500 feet

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.850 
should yield about close to 2,500 feet
elevation<00:02:49.239> gain<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.739> would<00:02:50.830> be

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
elevation gain so that would be

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.520 
elevation gain so that would be
beneficial<00:02:51.070> for<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:52.660> endurance<00:02:53.170> runners

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
beneficial for like endurance runners

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.080 
beneficial for like endurance runners
that<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.580> do

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.839 

the<00:02:59.090> long<00:03:01.959> ultramarathons<00:03:02.959> which<00:03:03.260> I've<00:03:03.409> done

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
the long ultramarathons which I've done

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.300 
the long ultramarathons which I've done
but<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:06.230> i'll<00:03:06.349> be<00:03:06.440> doing<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:08.420> then<00:03:09.409> from

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
but so i'll be doing that and then from

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.190 
but so i'll be doing that and then from
there<00:03:10.370> i'll<00:03:10.819> finish<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.659> Jacob's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
there i'll finish with the Jacob's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.000 
there i'll finish with the Jacob's
Ladder<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.940> Jacob's<00:03:14.329> Ladder<00:03:14.420> well<00:03:15.140> I'm

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
Ladder and the Jacob's Ladder well I'm

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.220 
Ladder and the Jacob's Ladder well I'm
going<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.400> try<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.610> equal<00:03:17.209> what<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> did<00:03:18.079> last

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
going to try to equal what I did last

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.250 
going to try to equal what I did last
Saturday<00:03:18.620> fresh<00:03:19.480> which<00:03:20.480> was<00:03:20.690> one<00:03:21.019> mile<00:03:21.230> per

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
Saturday fresh which was one mile per

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.180 
Saturday fresh which was one mile per
hour<00:03:21.879> 5280<00:03:22.879> feet<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.269> ladder<00:03:24.019> climbing<00:03:24.500> which

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
hour 5280 feet of ladder climbing which

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.530 
hour 5280 feet of ladder climbing which
yields<00:03:25.700> approx<00:03:28.030> 2,300<00:03:29.030> feet<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.390> elevation

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
yields approx 2,300 feet of elevation

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.990 
yields approx 2,300 feet of elevation
gain<00:03:29.930> which<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.950> equivalent<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.430> what<00:03:31.970> I

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
gain which is equivalent to what I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.910 
gain which is equivalent to what I
elevation<00:03:32.690> gain<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.959> did<00:03:33.109> on<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.440> treadmill

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
elevation gain I did on the treadmill

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.819 
elevation gain I did on the treadmill
and<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.910> bike<00:03:35.060> only<00:03:35.870> under<00:03:36.200> race<00:03:36.349> condition

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
and the bike only under race condition

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.410 
and the bike only under race condition
so<00:03:37.040> we'll<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:38.030> i'll<00:03:38.810> post<00:03:39.140> my<00:03:39.859> results<00:03:40.420> later

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
so we'll see i'll post my results later

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.020 
so we'll see i'll post my results later
you<00:03:41.720> guys<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.079> great<00:03:42.200> day<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:43.000> wish<00:03:44.000> me

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
you guys have a great day and wish me

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.109 
you guys have a great day and wish me
luck<00:03:44.299> bye
