like<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:42.259> the<00:04:43.259> benefit<00:04:43.590> of<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:43.800> is<00:04:44.039> you<00:04:44.970> can

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
like this the benefit of this is you can

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.540 
like this the benefit of this is you can
fill<00:04:45.330> them<00:04:45.419> up<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.620> maximum<00:04:47.039> amount<00:04:47.130> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
fill them up to the maximum amount and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.909 
fill them up to the maximum amount and
the<00:04:47.970> machine<00:04:48.270> will<00:04:48.479> then<00:04:48.630> weigh<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.710> load

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
the machine will then weigh the load

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.339 
the machine will then weigh the load
that's<00:04:50.190> in<00:04:50.340> there<00:04:50.520> at<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.669> moment<00:04:50.789> and

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
that's in there at the moment and

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.420 
that's in there at the moment and
release<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.710> appropriate<00:04:53.099> amount<00:04:53.340> of

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
release the appropriate amount of

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.860 
release the appropriate amount of
