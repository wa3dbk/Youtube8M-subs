piers

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
piers

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
piers

these<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> peers<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.560> gonna<00:00:31.650> be

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
these are the peers that are gonna be

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
these are the peers that are gonna be
across<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.669> front<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> porch<00:00:33.690> they'll

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
across the front of the porch they'll

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
across the front of the porch they'll
actually<00:00:34.170> support<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> porch<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.760> what's

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
actually support the porch and what's

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.819 
actually support the porch and what's
interesting<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.899> these<00:00:37.200> were<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.380> set

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
interesting is that these were just set

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.220 
interesting is that these were just set
on<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.370> concrete<00:00:39.090> foundation<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> foundation

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
on a concrete foundation the foundation

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.930 
on a concrete foundation the foundation
is<00:00:40.920> 1<00:00:41.790> foot<00:00:42.180> deep<00:00:42.870> by<00:00:43.290> 2<00:00:43.350> feet<00:00:43.920> wide<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
is 1 foot deep by 2 feet wide so the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.400 
is 1 foot deep by 2 feet wide so the
guys<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.360> already<00:00:45.420> started<00:00:45.780> laying<00:00:46.260> these

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
guys have already started laying these

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
guys have already started laying these
up<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.250> come<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.969> guess

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
up and these will come up and I guess

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
up and these will come up and I guess
they'll<00:00:48.390> come<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.350> height<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
they'll come up to this height which is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
they'll come up to this height which is
the<00:00:50.340> finished<00:00:50.640> floor<00:00:50.820> height<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.690> will

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the finished floor height they will

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.510 
the finished floor height they will
actually<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> finished<00:00:52.949> war<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.399> we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually be a finished war because we

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060 
actually be a finished war because we
got<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.140> packing<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.920> will

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
got the packing going right they will

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.740 
got the packing going right they will
actually<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.300> bit<00:00:57.420> lower

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
actually be up just a little bit lower

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
actually be up just a little bit lower
because<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.680> porch<00:00:58.949> deck<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.699> be

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
because your porch deck it has to be

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.029 
because your porch deck it has to be
just<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.180> tad<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.530> suppose

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
just a tad bit right so the can suppose

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
just a tad bit right so the can suppose
the<00:01:02.190> water<00:01:02.399> all<00:01:02.670> cracked<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.449> yeah<00:01:03.899> okay

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the water all cracked right yeah okay

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.929 
the water all cracked right yeah okay
well<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> didn't<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.309> Tony<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
well I didn't know if Tony was going to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.359 
well I didn't know if Tony was going to
take<00:01:06.090> care<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

carpentry<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.810> take

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
carpentry side that you actually take

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
carpentry side that you actually take
care<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> masonry<00:01:11.729> side<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.390> make

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it just a little bit yeah that'll way he

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679 
it just a little bit yeah that'll way he
won't<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> make<00:01:14.670> any<00:01:14.850> cuts<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.509> won't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
won't have to make any cuts and we won't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.030 
won't have to make any cuts and we won't
have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.770> lower<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have to make it because we just lower it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.910 
have to make it because we just lower it
down<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.580> that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.950 

yeah<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:21.850> what's<00:01:22.030> interesting<00:01:22.210> about<00:01:22.630> this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
yeah so what's interesting about this

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.200 
yeah so what's interesting about this
mud<00:01:23.260> is<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.159> literally<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.880> glue<00:01:25.180> that

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
mud is that it's literally the glue that

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.180 
mud is that it's literally the glue that
holds<00:01:25.720> this<00:01:26.440> together

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
holds this together

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.250 
holds this together
it's<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.850> glue<00:01:28.120> that's<00:01:28.390> holding<00:01:28.659> all<00:01:29.110> of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's the glue that's holding all of

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.370 
it's the glue that's holding all of
these<00:01:29.380> little<00:01:29.680> Lego<00:01:29.920> blocks<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.820> place<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.510> so

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
these little Lego blocks in place and so

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.930 
these little Lego blocks in place and so
you<00:01:32.740> want<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:32.950> make<00:01:33.130> sure<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.640> get<00:01:33.760> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
you want to make sure that you get the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.760 
you want to make sure that you get the
right<00:01:34.180> ratio<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.290> three<00:01:35.560> ingredients

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
right ratio of the three ingredients

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.460 
right ratio of the three ingredients
that<00:01:36.460> go<00:01:36.640> into<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.390> what<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.290> we

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
that go into it so what we have is we

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.840 
that go into it so what we have is we
have<00:01:39.390> masonry<00:01:40.390> cement<00:01:40.930> okay<00:01:41.410> one<00:01:42.070> bag<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
have masonry cement okay one bag of that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.040 
have masonry cement okay one bag of that
is<00:01:43.180> then<00:01:43.750> combined<00:01:44.259> in<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.890> mixer<00:01:45.369> with

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
is then combined in the mixer with

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.950 
is then combined in the mixer with
fourteen<00:01:47.050> or<00:01:47.409> sixteen<00:01:47.909> shovels<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:49.119> masonry

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
fourteen or sixteen shovels of masonry

into the mortar mix because these guys

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.480 
into the mortar mix because these guys
are<00:02:04.930> throwing<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.560> stuff<00:02:05.830> up<00:02:06.070> pretty<00:02:06.250> fast

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
are throwing this stuff up pretty fast

are throwing this stuff up pretty fast
compared<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.539> brick<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.350> little<00:02:08.649> bit

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
compared to the brick it is a little bit

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.830 
compared to the brick it is a little bit
different<00:02:09.220> brick<00:02:09.459> doesn't<00:02:09.880> necessarily<00:02:10.660> have

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
different brick doesn't necessarily have

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.740 
different brick doesn't necessarily have
to<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.410> strong<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:13.090> has<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.390> strong<00:02:13.600> but

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
to be a strong it has to be strong but

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
to be a strong it has to be strong but
not<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:14.080> strong<00:02:14.350> as<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.560> block<00:02:14.739> does<00:02:14.980> because

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
not as strong as the block does because

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.979 
not as strong as the block does because
the<00:02:15.400> block<00:02:15.610> actually<00:02:16.030> holds<00:02:16.360> pretty<00:02:16.660> much<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
the block actually holds pretty much the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.990 
the block actually holds pretty much the
whole<00:02:17.140> house<00:02:17.350> turn<00:02:17.800> alright<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.519> there's<00:02:18.820> what

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
whole house turn alright so there's what

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.030 
whole house turn alright so there's what
these<00:02:19.209> block<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.750> really<00:02:20.019> bond<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.830> well

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
these block to really bond really well

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.820 
these block to really bond really well
what's<00:02:21.940> interesting<00:02:22.180> is<00:02:22.540> end<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.260> end<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.680> got

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
what's interesting is end to end you got

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.039 
what's interesting is end to end you got
this<00:02:23.980> groove<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.570> you've<00:02:25.870> got

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
this groove here that and you've got

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.490 
this groove here that and you've got
this<00:02:26.260> sort<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.620> coarse<00:02:27.989> texture<00:02:28.989> that's<00:02:29.260> got<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this sort of coarse texture that's got a

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.110 
this sort of coarse texture that's got a
lot<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.829> little<00:02:29.980> holes<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.730> where<00:02:30.910> it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
lot of little holes in it where it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.690 
lot of little holes in it where it
allows<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.750> cement<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.560> help<00:02:32.950> bond<00:02:33.220> one

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
allows that cement to help bond one

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.580 
allows that cement to help bond one
block<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.570> crack<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.260> know<00:02:35.380> it'll

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
block to that crack and you know it'll

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.890 
block to that crack and you know it'll
create<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.160> lock<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> teeth<00:02:37.030> between<00:02:37.450> one

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
create a lock like a teeth between one

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.960 
create a lock like a teeth between one
block<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> other<00:02:38.440> buck<00:02:38.799> yeah<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.760> once

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
block and the other buck yeah and once

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.030 
block and the other buck yeah and once
this<00:02:40.180> water<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.900> mixed<00:02:41.260> up<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.769> can't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
this water is mixed up you just can't

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.960 
this water is mixed up you just can't
wait<00:02:42.310> around<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.820> got<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.209> used

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
wait around it's got to be used

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.450 
wait around it's got to be used
be<00:02:44.060> fresh<00:02:44.450> because<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.230> moisture<00:02:45.920> what

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
be fresh because that moisture what

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.600
