00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
build for speed here you build for

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910 
build for speed here you build for
defense<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> build<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.379> attack<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
defense or you can build for attack you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
defense or you can build for attack you
can<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> always<00:01:02.640> customize<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
can see you can always customize that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
can see you can always customize that
you<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> exploded<00:01:04.049> view<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you have the exploded view here they can

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
you have the exploded view here they can
come<00:01:05.339> apart<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> old<00:01:06.210> ones<00:01:06.510> did<00:01:06.600> and

come apart just as the old ones did and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
come apart just as the old ones did and
you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.380> interchange<00:01:07.619> parts<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.460> pull<00:01:08.760> them

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
you can interchange parts and pull them

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
you can interchange parts and pull them
all<00:01:09.060> together<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.689> made<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.020> rubber<00:01:10.260> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
all together and all made of rubber so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
all together and all made of rubber so
that<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.700> easily<00:01:11.939> too<00:01:12.360> easy<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.020> go<00:01:13.170> up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that they're easily too easy to go up

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
that they're easily too easy to go up
ramps<00:01:13.590> better<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.070> stunts<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ramps better for stunts and then you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.520 
ramps better for stunts and then you
have<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> stunt<00:01:15.630> goal<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> change

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
have the stunt goal which you can change

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.249 
have the stunt goal which you can change
and<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.009> come<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.790> pillars

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
and then they come with the two pillars

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.249 
and then they come with the two pillars
here<00:01:19.259> last<00:01:19.860> pillars<00:01:20.330> which<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.960> adapt

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
here last pillars which also can adapt

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
here last pillars which also can adapt
into<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.770> stunt<00:01:23.009> goal<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
into the stunt goal so you can make it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
into the stunt goal so you can make it
then<00:01:24.540> far<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.200> difficult<00:01:25.409> jump<00:01:25.860> split<00:01:26.850> down

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
then far more difficult jump split down

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.370 
then far more difficult jump split down
the<00:01:27.060> middle<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> raise<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.020> where<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the middle or you can raise it where you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
the middle or you can raise it where you
can<00:01:28.530> move<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.210> head<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
can move it and then here the head to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.760 
can move it and then here the head to
head<00:01:30.750> collision<00:01:31.020> map<00:01:31.470> oh<00:01:32.689> yeah<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> go

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
head collision map oh yeah you can go

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.649 
head collision map oh yeah you can go
head<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> head<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.729> buddy<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.450> going
