00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 earlier terrex today atlas the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 construction equipment manufacturer from ganderkesee 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 has the wheel loader production from terrex 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.710
 accepted 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.650
 The kink handlebars come under the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.630
 traditional names kÃ¤lble on the market that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.720
 current wheel loader program includes four 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 models with scoops from 16 to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 3,1 cubic meters of engines at 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 These vehicles are used 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 this is once the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.660
 perkins 4 4-liter with 74 5 kw 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 which is used in the 160 at the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 We have the other three models 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 Cummins machines are 6.4 liters 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 machine with 119 kw in it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 ventilation system is in these stores 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.379
 Next we pull the cooled one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.109
 clean air behind the cabin and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 lead them backwards from the back 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.969
 means we have none 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.979
 Difficulties that dust and and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.180
 other things in the ventilation system 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.100
 can get into it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 The ventilation system should be as such 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.070
 will then be demand-driven 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.110
 that is only when the ventilation 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.970
 is required then turns on 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 whole thing accordingly 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.420
 that's what we think about diesel consumption 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.630
 use in high power storage 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 an lwv system at the bigger ones 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.610
 machinery 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 this system allows the driver a lot 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.930
 fall for the area to work 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 it comes very close to a system of everything 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 and we have the opportunity 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 also to save energy so in these 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 to save fuel and the whole 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.810
 machine works very well 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 economically our main customer is the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 company terex with its classic terrex 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 White 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.540
 furthermore we have 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.600
 The color blue as color for the bowlers 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.280
 atlas regulated devices that is orange 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.990
 of course also possible and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.860
 all other shades of color are 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.860
 available 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.090
