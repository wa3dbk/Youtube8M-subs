00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.269
 good morning citizens net that pedro 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 vasconcelos and welcome another video and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.690
 This time I'm here with a little life. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.509
 Different, I just wanted to show you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 rather than the aac is the canada 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 especially when it has snowed in recent 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 years in the last 24 hours 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.760
 took about 30 centimeters of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.840
 snow and that's where the state is so 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.529
 is that is aas age when it snows I 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.969
 I wanted to think it was something 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.920
 interesting is that you do not see much 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 Brazil is still leading to the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.690
 signal and should only stop from here tomorrow 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 but I'll show you a little bit how it is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 that is for you to look only this one is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 my house 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 if you have an idea and it only has the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.539
 pine trees in front of the house 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.370
 completely covered in snow 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 This is not a problem here. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.840
 contrary by contrast but the club a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.120
 Channel, I 'll keep it in a moment. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 you here is the way this out of here guys 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 and the sidewalk in front of the house is here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.970
 As you can see 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 basically it does not exist anymore 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.979
 basically a great deal 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.270
 white this here is my street look you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.369
 have an idea what you want to drive here 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.560
 There is not much comparison driving here. 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 You're just going to go slowly. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 and skidding back and forth 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.540
 there the back of the house looks like the house 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 How is the car there and everything? 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.619
 And he has to go out here to be able to 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.659
 to the city to the street and everything 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 Look, this is the way to the sidewalk like 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.220
 I said and let's go I want to cross 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 the street that left and passing that with 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 caution 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.040
 I want to look at it, this is one 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.670
 basically an avenue is an avenue 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 here in the city and look at the state 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 which stays after an entire night 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 leading is that makes clear is not so the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.869
 all the time 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.290
 quite the opposite, which is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.329
 simply one is an occasion that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.829
 happens with some frequency but 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.990
 happens even with a certain frequency 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.490
 Look at if you lost the car was 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.989
 accelerate he skid 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.360
 but it is a path up to certain 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.280
 frequency sometimes sometimes 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.650
 in the month however it is not always so 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.849
 It's usually from here that you can see the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.489
 everything else 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.510
 let's cross here quickly what 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.880
 I want to show you that here O 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.120
 This is where I am now and here 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.849
 I'm now a way to race. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.239
 personal runs here and does activity 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.430
 physical and such and it is on the verge of a 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.600
 one of a river of a same channel that passes 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.640
 that cuts the city 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 to him that you can see there has a 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.850
 juvÃªncio bridge was able to zoom in 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.950
 for you 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.440
 is not it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.569
 ready the zoom half as slow as you 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.860
 can see a bridge and this is a 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.989
 sending is a channel that during the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.080
 universe is completely complete 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.350
 covered with snow and over from here to 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.630
 Little will they clean the snow and will 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.070
 stand alone the ice frozen water it goes 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.620
 be released as a skating rink 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.840
 then he can go out and walk and walk 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.700
 go around town skating on the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.190
 Who knows later, if you want 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.380
 I do not bring a video for you, I do not 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.600
 I was able to show now that you do not have 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.239
 nobody but now there were just people 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.739
 passing by on the run here giving by doing 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.940
 physical activity giving one with a 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.700
 city race 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.819
 here in the middle here man looks that state 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.160
 said the black rush to go by train 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.200
 of thing of a normal running day 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.329
 this is the most normal thing for them 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.370
 Something so surreal to me, I already 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.500
 I've lived here for about three years and it's still 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.019
 something completely surreal to me 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.269
 So imagine you there I do not know if 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.950
 You already saw snow if you have already seen 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.790
 that amount of snow this here 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.790
 it is not something to see snow here is something is something out 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.329
 of the common guy I think it's sensational and I 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.200
 I wanted to and I wanted to go show you 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.169
 o How is it? How does it work? 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.199
 Actually, I have my eye on my house. 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:14.300
 completely covered in snow and ice 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.830
 also hanging on why 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.830
 The funny thing is, it's not like the time. 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.520
 all the aac is heating up and when 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.920
 warm up when the snow warms 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.490
 melting melts a bit but even 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.010
 so it is not stay is not so much is not so 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.870
 it is not so strong it is still very cold and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.360
 it is still very snowy but the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.430
 The streets and sidewalks are a 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.610
 little more passable now really 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.830
 is something out of the ordinary a cross 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.890
 Let's see that car there, right? 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:52.310
 cross that we are that guys this 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.010
 video was basically look what is this 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.000
 that has to make that during the flight the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:02.000
 winter has to get snow out of the front 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.300
 of the house and such, you can not 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.510
 walk the guy picks up and goes and goes 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.650
 cleaning up the snow is something super normal and 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.720
 It's just that this video would be 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.540
 interesting to show you a 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.740
 Bit of how can Canada stay here 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.930
 all taken 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.590
 I'm here in the street now left 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.380
 until climbing the mountain looking do not know 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:30.010
 you can see the size difference there 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:33.140
 But it's tiring, it's snowing, I get tired. 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.550
 It's really a lot that's what I found 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.200

 covered in snow if you liked that 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.090
