00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.089
 in doubt traders did not agree 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.669
 the driving red has been driven 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.999
 normal 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.210
 the classic version 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.900
 this morning 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.279
 that coming Saturday it's not easy 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.970
 The Hermes House Band was also founded 25 years ago 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.260
 are the home of the hermes student society of the rotterdams student corps 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.350
 find out 94 beautiful group dollars with the suitcase of the tanning dispensers 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 image disappears 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.770
 this single has been sold more than two and a half million times worldwide as well 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.190
 now it is going to demand the whole carp day again more feyenoord scores 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.050
 it was immediately clear which song should be released 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.800
 for the anniversary 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 and sharing that cloyne and singing it yourself is really a dream come true fifteen 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850
 years ago when the famous band and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 no more 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.189
 and then transported 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.159
 love the project once that would with the nice weather now have it on 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.159
 plate he is very good 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 8 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.410
 so we know the hermes house band in but on saturday in the new luxor 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.080
 a very different sound 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.370
 because then they play together with the classic rotterdam and beaches 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.980
 collaborate with a package 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 that takes some getting used to for young musicians 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.920
 this week know that however 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.939
 Advertising for the first time saw weird the orchestra was looking forward to 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.890
 within 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.080
 and you have to swallow after 8 are used to pounding 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.390
 v play chairman and I finally agree on what is really beautiful 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.250
 perform classical pieces or perform in the rotterdam and stand 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.599
 a new single 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.949
 I actually still have time for the boys to study 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949
 if you are a few misses the 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.689
 thereby becoming the owner again 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.829
 and also more chances and what does it matter if you can sing like that 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.170
 late
