00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so now we're gonna measure the target

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.240 
so now we're gonna measure the target
now<00:00:02.730> doing<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:03.870> easy<00:00:04.170> I'm<00:00:04.740> gonna<00:00:05.040> do

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and I got the red square so let's do it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.170 
and I got the red square so let's do it
again<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> click<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.960> and

look over here what's happened is it's
moved<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> next<00:00:48.930> target<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> again<00:00:50.010> I'm

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
moved to the next target and again I'm

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
moved to the next target and again I'm
going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.020> hold<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> white<00:00:52.739> click

same thing again now we've done the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
same thing again now we've done the
first<00:01:02.820> part<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> calibration<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.989> see

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
first part of the calibration you see

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.780 
first part of the calibration you see
how<00:01:04.260> all<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.610> now

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
how all of these here are now

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
how all of these here are now
highlighted<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> click<00:01:06.960> next<00:01:07.439> so

highlighted I'm going to click next so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.830 
highlighted I'm going to click next so
now<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.310> we've<00:01:08.580> measured<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> first<00:01:09.330> test

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now that we've measured the first test

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.380 
now that we've measured the first test
target<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.439> we're<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.390> create

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
target what we're going to do is create

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
target what we're going to do is create
the<00:01:12.750> second<00:01:13.200> test<00:01:13.439> target<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.040> what's<00:01:14.189> going

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the second test target so what's going

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
the second test target so what's going
to<00:01:14.400> happen<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> software<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
to happen is the software is going to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
to happen is the software is going to
take<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.740> we've<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:16.939> measured

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
take a look at what we've just measured

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
take a look at what we've just measured
and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.479> create<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> second<00:01:19.409> test<00:01:19.619> target

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and then create a second test target

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.080 
and then create a second test target
which<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> print<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.939> let's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
which we're going to print out so let's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.929 
which we're going to print out so let's
take<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> look<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.140> hit<00:01:22.830> next

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
take a look at how to do that I hit next

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.890 
take a look at how to do that I hit next
now<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.000> have<00:01:24.560> our<00:01:25.560> print<00:01:26.369> second<00:01:26.759> test<00:01:26.970> chart

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
now we have our print second test chart

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950 
now we have our print second test chart
we're<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> hit<00:01:28.409> print<00:01:29.509> continue<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
we're going to hit print continue and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
we're going to hit print continue and
again<00:01:31.890> we're<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.430> sure<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
again we're gonna make sure that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
again we're gonna make sure that
everything<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.750> set<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
everything is set up the way we want it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 
everything is set up the way we want it
to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> set<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.509> what's<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> happen

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to be set up now what's going to happen

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
to be set up now what's going to happen
is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.950> printer<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> print<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
is the printer is going to print the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
is the printer is going to print the
second<00:01:39.450> target<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.890> we're<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
second target that we're now going to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
second target that we're now going to
measure<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:41.939> that's<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> look

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
measure and what that's going to look

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.800 
measure and what that's going to look
like<00:01:43.159> is<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.399> gonna<00:01:44.490> look<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.720> if

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
like is it's gonna look like this so if

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.980 
like is it's gonna look like this so if
you<00:01:45.899> notice<00:01:47.210> there<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.509> different

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you notice there are two different

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.679 
you notice there are two different
targets<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> target<00:01:52.189> created<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.270> target

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
targets this target created this target

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.789 
targets this target created this target
the<00:01:54.810> measurements<00:01:55.259> from<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.530> target

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the measurements from this target

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.270 
the measurements from this target
created<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.850> target<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> now<00:02:00.950> let's<00:02:01.950> click

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
created this target so now let's click

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
created this target so now let's click
Next<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.509> what<00:02:06.509> you'll<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.110> comes

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
Next and what you'll see when it comes

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.040 
Next and what you'll see when it comes
up<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.160> will<00:02:08.310> you'll<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.060> clock<00:02:09.780> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
up is it will you'll get this clock that

me change that to velvet fine art which

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.059 
me change that to velvet fine art which
would<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.350> V<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:42.030> Epson<00:02:42.600> velvet<00:02:42.959> fine<00:02:43.170> art<00:02:43.350> 2880

paper for a specific printer which will

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.530 
paper for a specific printer which will
give<00:02:55.320> me<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.470> best<00:02:55.620> possible<00:02:56.310> print<00:02:56.970> now<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
give me the best possible print now the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.330 
give me the best possible print now the
profiles<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.260> come<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.010> printers

profiles that come with the printers

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
profiles that come with the printers
that<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.580> buy<00:02:59.730> are<00:03:00.030> okay<00:03:00.720> too<00:03:00.780> good<00:03:01.140> these<00:03:01.980> are

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that you buy are okay too good these are

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.460 
that you buy are okay too good these are
great<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.760> exceptional<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.260> little

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
great to exceptional it's that little

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.440 
great to exceptional it's that little
bit<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:05.010> makes<00:03:05.280> those<00:03:05.550> prints<00:03:05.970> sing<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
bit that makes those prints sing and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.759 
bit that makes those prints sing and
that's<00:03:06.569> why<00:03:06.750> we're<00:03:06.930> doing<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.290> here<00:03:07.620> now

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
that's why we're doing this here now

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.180 
that's why we're doing this here now
keep<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.400> mind<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.819> plenty<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.450> other

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
keep in mind I have plenty of other

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.320 
keep in mind I have plenty of other
calibration<00:03:11.190> devices<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.760> use<00:03:11.940> when<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.120> am

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
calibration devices that I use when I am

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.059 
calibration devices that I use when I am
in<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> studio<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.530> when<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.040> field

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
in the studio but when I'm in the field

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.800 
in the studio but when I'm in the field
the<00:03:14.550> device<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> always<00:03:15.209> bring<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.510> me

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the device that I always bring with me

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.080 
the device that I always bring with me
is<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.500> color<00:03:16.680> monkey<00:03:17.069> why<00:03:17.340> because

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
is that is the color monkey why because

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.539 
is that is the color monkey why because
I<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.329> profile<00:03:18.810> my<00:03:19.019> monitor<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:19.860> can<00:03:20.010> profile<00:03:20.519> a

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
I can profile my monitor I can profile a

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.949 
I can profile my monitor I can profile a
projector<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.180> most<00:03:21.329> importantly<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.840> can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
projector and most importantly I can

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.620 
projector and most importantly I can
make<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.470> printer<00:03:22.950> specific<00:03:23.579> profile<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.360> the

make a printer specific profile in the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.780 
make a printer specific profile in the
field<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.860> printer<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.400> I'm<00:03:26.549> working

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
field for the printer that I'm working

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.620 
field for the printer that I'm working
on<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.310> said<00:03:29.670> let<00:03:30.060> me<00:03:30.090> show<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
on so with that said let me show you the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.000 
on so with that said let me show you the
rest<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.110> software<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:31.769> we'll<00:03:31.890> move

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
rest of the software and then we'll move

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.310 
rest of the software and then we'll move
into<00:03:32.160> making<00:03:32.549> an<00:03:32.760> optimized<00:03:33.299> profile<00:03:33.840> all

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
into making an optimized profile all

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.660 
into making an optimized profile all
right<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.630> now<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.660> we've<00:03:37.010> hit<00:03:38.010> save<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
right so now that we've hit save and the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.759 
right so now that we've hit save and the
probe<00:03:38.880> we're<00:03:39.030> gonna<00:03:39.120> hit<00:03:39.299> save<00:03:39.660> which<00:03:40.590> we've

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
probe we're gonna hit save which we've

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.560 
probe we're gonna hit save which we've
done<00:03:40.980> we're<00:03:41.160> gonna<00:03:41.250> hit<00:03:41.459> next<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.450> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
done we're gonna hit next and I have a

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.860 
done we're gonna hit next and I have a

I'm<00:03:48.510> not<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.959> do<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.200> I'm<00:03:49.440> going<00:03:50.070> to

is in black and white the thing to keep

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.219 
is in black and white the thing to keep
in<00:05:07.090> mind<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.539> when<00:05:07.720> you're<00:05:07.870> making<00:05:07.900> a

in mind is that when you're making a
black-and-white<00:05:08.710> image<00:05:08.889> what<00:05:09.310> you're

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
black-and-white image what you're

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.370 
black-and-white image what you're
actually<00:05:09.639> doing<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:10.300> printing<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.900> color<00:05:11.139> image

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
actually doing is printing a color image

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.640 
actually doing is printing a color image

using a monochromatic scale that is the
color<00:05:14.889> gray<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.910> let's<00:05:16.150> take<00:05:16.419> a<00:05:16.449> look<00:05:16.780> at<00:05:16.990> how

the one we just looked at see it and
we're<00:06:14.530> gonna<00:06:14.650> hit<00:06:14.860> next<00:06:15.510> what's<00:06:16.510> going<00:06:16.750> to

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
we're gonna hit next what's going to

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.260 
we're gonna hit next what's going to
happen<00:06:17.229> is<00:06:17.410> we're<00:06:17.710> going<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:17.949> get<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.729> profile

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
happen is we're going to get a profile

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.960 
happen is we're going to get a profile
that<00:06:19.449> is<00:06:19.690> generated<00:06:20.289> using<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.710> colors<00:06:21.160> and

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
that is generated using the colors and

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.250 
that is generated using the colors and
let's<00:06:22.150> zoom<00:06:22.300> in<00:06:22.449> to<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:22.539> so<00:06:22.750> you<00:06:22.810> can<00:06:22.960> see<00:06:23.139> it

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
let's zoom in to that so you can see it

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.890 
let's zoom in to that so you can see it
you<00:06:23.800> see<00:06:23.949> out<00:06:24.070> now<00:06:24.310> using<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.789> colors<00:06:25.300> that

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
you see out now using the colors that

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.070 
you see out now using the colors that
had<00:06:26.110> derived<00:06:26.440> out<00:06:26.949> of<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.310> file<00:06:27.780> again<00:06:28.780> we<00:06:28.930> go

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
had derived out of the file again we go

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.560 
had derived out of the file again we go
to<00:06:29.139> print<00:06:29.470> continue<00:06:30.130> and<00:06:30.550> we<00:06:31.060> set<00:06:31.300> up<00:06:31.330> our

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
to print continue and we set up our

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.659 
to print continue and we set up our
dialog<00:06:32.080> box<00:06:32.380> making<00:06:32.950> sure<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.280> everything

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
dialog box making sure that everything

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.909 
dialog box making sure that everything
is<00:06:33.820> correct<00:06:34.000> once<00:06:34.990> we've<00:06:35.169> done<00:06:35.380> that<00:06:35.440> let's

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
is correct once we've done that let's

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.379 
is correct once we've done that let's
say<00:06:36.070> we<00:06:36.099> have<00:06:36.430> we<00:06:36.669> hit

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
say we have we hit

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.960 
say we have we hit
you<00:06:37.990> will<00:06:38.139> now<00:06:38.290> print<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:38.680> profile<00:06:39.190> so<00:06:39.850> now

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
you will now print the profile so now

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.310 
you will now print the profile so now
the<00:06:40.030> software<00:06:40.570> is<00:06:40.630> going<00:06:40.780> to<00:06:40.900> create<00:06:41.110> another

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
the software is going to create another

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.790 
the software is going to create another
target<00:06:42.310> using<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.720> measurements<00:06:44.320> that<00:06:44.380> we<00:06:44.530> of

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
target using the measurements that we of

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.469 
target using the measurements that we of
the<00:06:45.100> profile<00:06:45.610> that<00:06:45.760> we<00:06:45.880> created<00:06:46.150> from<00:06:46.330> the

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
the profile that we created from the

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.960 
the profile that we created from the
other<00:06:46.660> two<00:06:46.960> targets<00:06:47.470> based<00:06:48.100> on<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.610> image

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
other two targets based on the image

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.550 
other two targets based on the image
that<00:06:49.000> we<00:06:49.330> asked<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:49.930> compare<00:06:50.320> and<00:06:50.470> what

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
that we asked it to compare and what

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.340 
that we asked it to compare and what
that<00:06:50.710> target<00:06:51.130> is<00:06:51.220> going<00:06:51.310> to<00:06:51.400> look<00:06:51.610> like<00:06:52.350> is

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
that target is going to look like is

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.469 
that target is going to look like is
it's<00:06:53.590> gonna<00:06:53.680> look<00:06:53.919> like<00:06:54.130> this<00:06:54.460> because<00:06:55.389> you

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
it's gonna look like this because you

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.939 
it's gonna look like this because you
can<00:06:55.600> see<00:06:55.630> it's<00:06:55.870> all<00:06:56.020> grayscale<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:56.740> this

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
can see it's all grayscale and this

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.400 
can see it's all grayscale and this
target<00:06:57.190> is<00:06:57.460> based<00:06:57.760> off<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:58.479> the<00:06:58.570> image<00:06:59.080> that<00:06:59.260> we

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
target is based off of the image that we

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.260 
target is based off of the image that we
asked<00:06:59.979> it<00:07:00.070> to<00:07:00.160> measure<00:07:00.340> so<00:07:00.970> we're<00:07:01.090> going<00:07:01.180> to

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
asked it to measure so we're going to

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.020 
asked it to measure so we're going to
now<00:07:01.360> optimize<00:07:02.020> our<00:07:02.260> profile<00:07:02.740> specific<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:03.850> the

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
now optimize our profile specific to the

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.300 
now optimize our profile specific to the
to<00:07:04.389> the<00:07:04.510> print<00:07:04.780> at<00:07:04.930> hand<00:07:05.290> on<00:07:05.470> the<00:07:05.740> paper<00:07:05.979> and

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
to the print at hand on the paper and

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.770 
to the print at hand on the paper and
the<00:07:06.430> printer<00:07:06.729> that<00:07:06.910> we<00:07:07.030> want<00:07:07.210> to<00:07:07.300> use<00:07:07.449> to<00:07:07.600> print

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
the printer that we want to use to print

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.430 
the printer that we want to use to print
it<00:07:09.419> how<00:07:10.419> we're<00:07:10.570> going<00:07:10.690> to<00:07:10.750> do<00:07:10.960> that<00:07:11.169> is<00:07:11.320> we're

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
it how we're going to do that is we're

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.640 
it how we're going to do that is we're
going<00:07:11.530> to<00:07:11.590> hit<00:07:11.710> next<00:07:11.950> and<00:07:13.110> once<00:07:14.110> it's<00:07:14.290> printed

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
going to hit next and once it's printed

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.600 
going to hit next and once it's printed
we're<00:07:14.740> going<00:07:14.860> to<00:07:14.919> go<00:07:15.010> through<00:07:15.220> that<00:07:15.310> clock

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.610 
we're going to go through that clock

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.040 
we're going to go through that clock
again<00:07:15.880> we<00:07:16.030> can<00:07:16.180> hit<00:07:16.300> skip<00:07:16.630> because<00:07:16.780> we've

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
again we can hit skip because we've

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.930 
again we can hit skip because we've
already<00:07:17.200> done<00:07:17.470> it<00:07:17.620> as<00:07:17.740> you<00:07:18.040> can<00:07:18.160> see<00:07:18.400> we<00:07:18.760> get

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
already done it as you can see we get

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.990 
already done it as you can see we get
the<00:07:19.150> same<00:07:19.830> target<00:07:20.830> back<00:07:21.010> up<00:07:21.220> here<00:07:21.490> and<00:07:21.669> I'm<00:07:21.820> now

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
the same target back up here and I'm now

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.690 
the same target back up here and I'm now
going<00:07:22.270> to<00:07:22.570> measure<00:07:23.470> it<00:07:23.740> now<00:07:24.250> that<00:07:24.430> we've<00:07:24.550> done

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 
going to measure it now that we've done

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.450 
going to measure it now that we've done
that<00:07:24.910> let's<00:07:25.180> take<00:07:25.330> next<00:07:25.950> it's<00:07:26.950> going<00:07:27.160> to<00:07:27.250> ask

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.460 
that let's take next it's going to ask

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.330 
that let's take next it's going to ask
me<00:07:27.669> to<00:07:28.380> save<00:07:29.380> it<00:07:29.560> and<00:07:29.710> what<00:07:29.800> I'm<00:07:29.919> going<00:07:30.130> to<00:07:30.190> do

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.340 
me to save it and what I'm going to do

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:38.520 
me to save it and what I'm going to do
here<00:07:30.760> is<00:07:30.940> I'm<00:07:31.240> going<00:07:31.510> to<00:07:31.770> add<00:07:34.050> b/w<00:07:37.289> for<00:07:38.289> black

and white and hit save the software is
going<00:07:44.620> to<00:07:44.710> create<00:07:44.950> a<00:07:45.010> profile<00:07:45.520> and<00:07:45.760> it's<00:07:46.240> then

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
going to create a profile and it's then

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.480 
going to create a profile and it's then
going<00:07:47.200> to<00:07:47.229> save<00:07:47.500> that<00:07:47.740> profile<00:07:48.160> and<00:07:48.310> that<00:07:48.370> will

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
going to save that profile and that will

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.790 
going to save that profile and that will
be<00:07:48.610> the<00:07:48.700> profile<00:07:49.150> that<00:07:49.450> I<00:07:49.510> will<00:07:49.750> use<00:07:49.990> to<00:07:50.590> create

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
be the profile that I will use to create

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.080 
be the profile that I will use to create
the<00:07:51.789> print<00:07:52.030> that<00:07:52.150> I<00:07:52.270> just<00:07:52.450> showed<00:07:52.660> you<00:07:54.090> that's

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.090 
the print that I just showed you that's

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.909 
the print that I just showed you that's
it<00:07:55.360> it's<00:07:55.570> pretty<00:07:55.780> straightforward<00:07:56.080> stuff<00:07:56.620> and

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 
it it's pretty straightforward stuff and

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:59.339 
it it's pretty straightforward stuff and
it's<00:07:57.160> pretty<00:07:57.370> simple<00:07:57.820> it's<00:07:58.330> far<00:07:58.630> more<00:07:58.660> scary

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349 
it's pretty simple it's far more scary

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:00.960 
it's pretty simple it's far more scary
to<00:07:59.440> think<00:07:59.889> about<00:08:00.160> it<00:08:00.340> than<00:08:00.490> it<00:08:00.610> is<00:08:00.669> to<00:08:00.729> actually

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970 
to think about it than it is to actually

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.960 
to think about it than it is to actually
do<00:08:01.450> it<00:08:01.599> and<00:08:01.750> the<00:08:02.560> quality<00:08:03.160> of<00:08:03.310> the<00:08:03.430> images<00:08:03.910> that

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:03.970 
do it and the quality of the images that

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.320 
do it and the quality of the images that
you<00:08:04.270> get<00:08:04.510> once<00:08:05.020> you<00:08:05.139> do<00:08:05.380> it<00:08:05.560> are<00:08:05.710> worth<00:08:06.520> the

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:07.330 
you get once you do it are worth the

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.629 
you get once you do it are worth the

amount of time that it takes to create
