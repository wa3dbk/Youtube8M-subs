00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.700
 and now they change the kidney and there was a lot 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.559
 I work in the port all the 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.300
 locomotives came and went pushing and 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.220
 dragging vans from one place to another 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.859
 one morning to see if I'm late 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.359
 quiet crane did not take in criticizing it 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.550
 you can make wait for these boats 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.900
 they carry an important cargo if 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.640
 they lose the tide they will have to stay 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.619
 in the port you have to be more 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.880
 respectful boats after 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.609
 everything is nothing but a small 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.860
 locomotive we have too much work 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.210
 snorted persie then maybe you 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.810
 work would not have to be a truck 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.430
 but if he did not leave his astonishment he told him 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.350
 to the other locomotives what had 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.769
 said franky 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 of the absurd experience on this island 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.070
 there are only locomotives said henry 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.980
 and if a truck comes 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.980
 and a truck arrived along with two others 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.210
 rankin was delighted 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.990
 and you down there were left without 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.970
 work 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.710
 now these trucks will be occupied there is one 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.980
 who wants to talk to you 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.780
 the truck was very rude 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.810
 what are you doing here in this bunch of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.190
 iron old and humiliating out iron 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190
 old pile of old irons 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.380
 a while later see if he found 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.280
 shadows and james another truck had been 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.929
 impolite with them then he saw Persian 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.789
 a little elf wheeled us 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.789
 would turn into scrap you will see 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.100
 my boiler that most frightening truck is 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 the bike more 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.060
 despicable nodded james 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.160
 the next one that met with a 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.160
 truck was topic 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 what disastrous railroad you should 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.500
 be in a museum working in a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.710
 quarry might look old but 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.010
 I am very useful 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.010
 the truck responded 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 sizzle toby let me interrupted 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.330
 the machinist do not bother discussing 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.230
 with the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will go to the flour mill 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.470
 but when they came to the mill toby no 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.560
 he could leave his astonishment when he saw another 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.530
 truck 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.090
 what are you doing here are you who 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.459
 we do the work of you are very 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.770
 slow the foreman talked to the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.660
 machinist toby or lamented the times 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.790
 they change 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.320
 it may be that he is still old said the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.830
 machinist but is reliable 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.530
 let's go toby we 'll go to the farms there 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.180
 they need everything and it comes out with slow and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.489
 sadly 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.590
 Toby tracks ran through a canyon 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.390
 narrow but the vehicles of good and for 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.390
 a steep and dangerous road 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.620
 when all I come back to the truck 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.030
 that had been found in the quarry 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.030
 It was loaded with stones 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.209
 in that truck has problems in his 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.209
 ankle and he was right 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.050
 the driver was fired from the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.540
 highway 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.890
 the remains of the truck were moved 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.860
 to the port 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.110
 to see if I look at the truck and it's this 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.510

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.620

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.819
