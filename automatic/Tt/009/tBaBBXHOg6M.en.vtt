from Lee Valley and I haven't had a
whole<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.670> luck<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.299> would

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
whole lot of good luck with them I would

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.819 
whole lot of good luck with them I would
avoid<00:01:45.630> buying<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.200> they're<00:01:46.500> supposed<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
avoid buying these they're supposed to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.310 
avoid buying these they're supposed to
be<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.060> they're<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.899> similar<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
be for you know they're very similar to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.800 
be for you know they're very similar to
the<00:01:49.530> exacto<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> field<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.390> isn't<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the exacto but the field just isn't the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.160 
the exacto but the field just isn't the
same<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.680> balance<00:01:53.189> isn't<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> same

same that the balance isn't the same
this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> convex<00:01:56.189> plane<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
this is also a convex plane and I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.770 
this is also a convex plane and I
haven't<00:01:56.969> had<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> whole<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.659> luck

haven't had a whole lot of good luck
with<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.259> either<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:59.130> similar<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
with this one either it's similar to the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690 
with this one either it's similar to the
other<00:01:59.969> spokeshave<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.700> curved

now<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.959> can<00:03:22.079> create<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.319> shooting<00:03:22.560> board

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
now you can create a shooting board

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.440 
now you can create a shooting board
there's<00:03:23.190> other<00:03:23.489> videos<00:03:23.880> out<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.299> how<00:03:24.389> to

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
there's other videos out there of how to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.300 
there's other videos out there of how to
create<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.750> shooting<00:03:25.049> board<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.920> plane<00:03:26.190> is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
create a shooting board this plane is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.210 
create a shooting board this plane is
really<00:03:26.400> nice<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> steady<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:28.440> know<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
really nice and steady you know it's a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.879 
really nice and steady you know it's a
jack-of-all-trades<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.989> does<00:03:31.200> most<00:03:31.590> work

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
jack-of-all-trades so it does most work

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.610 
jack-of-all-trades so it does most work
pretty<00:03:32.430> easily<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:33.139> did<00:03:34.139> buy<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.319> really

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
pretty easily I did buy a really

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.190 
pretty easily I did buy a really
expensive<00:03:34.769> scrub<00:03:35.609> plane<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.810> has<00:03:37.019> got<00:03:37.139> a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
expensive scrub plane and this has got a

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.680 
expensive scrub plane and this has got a
curved<00:03:37.799> blade<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:39.000> has<00:03:39.150> really<00:03:39.299> helped

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
curved blade and this has really helped

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.289 
curved blade and this has really helped
helpful<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.530> doing<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.310> lot<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.489> digging<00:03:42.120> out

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
helpful and doing a lot of digging out

helpful and doing a lot of digging out
of<00:03:42.510> wood<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.989> my<00:03:43.290> arch<00:03:43.500> top<00:03:43.769> tops<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.700> will<00:03:44.910> be

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
of wood on my arch top tops this will be

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.729 
of wood on my arch top tops this will be
a<00:03:45.060> really<00:03:45.389> aggressive<00:03:45.569> plane<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.560> you're

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a really aggressive plane and as you're

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.379 
a really aggressive plane and as you're
going<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.280> get<00:03:47.430> some<00:03:47.579> really<00:03:47.730> big<00:03:47.970> chunks

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389
