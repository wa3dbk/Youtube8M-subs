00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.790 
get a couple plastic toys but I want to
talk<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:31.279> about<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.789> longevity<00:00:32.300> of<00:00:33.109> wood

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
talk to you about the longevity of wood

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.919 
talk to you about the longevity of wood
toys<00:00:34.100> because<00:00:34.760> they<00:00:35.089> can<00:00:35.300> be<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.449> little<00:00:35.569> bit<00:00:35.809> of

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:35.929 
toys because they can be a little bit of

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.139 
toys because they can be a little bit of
an<00:00:36.019> investment<00:00:36.139> and<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.639> I<00:00:37.670> think<00:00:37.909> is<00:00:38.089> a

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
an investment and that I think is a

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.930 
an investment and that I think is a
deterrent<00:00:38.569> from<00:00:38.870> for<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.559> lot<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:40.039> people<00:00:40.370> from

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
deterrent from for a lot of people from

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.809 
deterrent from for a lot of people from
