how actually use the stand now as you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850 
how actually use the stand now as you
can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.970> clamp<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.900> desk<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
can see I do clamp it to my desk the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.080 
can see I do clamp it to my desk the
reason<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.640> don't<00:01:23.729> really<00:01:23.850> want

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
reason for this is I don't really want

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.580 
reason for this is I don't really want
to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> hole<00:01:24.689> through<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.080> desk<00:01:25.320> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to go make a hole through my desk but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.649 
to go make a hole through my desk but
obviously<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.790> had<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.119> permanent

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
obviously if you had a more permanent

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
obviously if you had a more permanent
solution<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
solution then it's up to you if you do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
solution then it's up to you if you do
want<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> drill<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> hole<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.270> the

mechanism you literally just slide it
onto<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> desk<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.119> silver<00:01:39.450> screw

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
onto the desk and use the silver screw

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
onto the desk and use the silver screw
tool<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.500> tighten<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.400> really

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
tool to tighten up and it's really

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
tool to tighten up and it's really
really<00:01:42.000> simple<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.079> here's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> desk<00:01:43.740> lamp

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
really simple so here's the desk lamp

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.499 
really simple so here's the desk lamp
from<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> other<00:01:44.520> side<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> see

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
from the other side so as you can see

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
from the other side so as you can see
you<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.840> bar<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.740> basically

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you got this bar down the back basically

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
you got this bar down the back basically
supports<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.299> attaches<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> desk

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
supports it and attaches it to the desk

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
supports it and attaches it to the desk
here<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> actual<00:01:50.430> base<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
here is the actual base you do have a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
here is the actual base you do have a
rogue<00:01:51.420> logo<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> map<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
rogue logo on the map and the back of it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
rogue logo on the map and the back of it
as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.090> obviously<00:01:54.479> like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
as well and then you have obviously like

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
as well and then you have obviously like
this<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.320> don't<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:55.950> what<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.130> call<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this and I don't know what they call it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
this and I don't know what they call it
like<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> point<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.479> comes<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.140> top

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
like a point that comes up to the top

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
like a point that comes up to the top
and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.009> basically<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.729> bit<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and then basically this bit here that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990 
and then basically this bit here that
spins<00:02:00.750> around<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.549> completely<00:02:02.549> loose<00:02:02.729> there's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
spins around is completely loose there's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.090 
spins around is completely loose there's
no<00:02:03.149> attached<00:02:03.570> fixings<00:02:04.140> inside<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.770> literally

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
no attached fixings inside you literally

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.069 
no attached fixings inside you literally
just<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> pole<00:02:05.759> down<00:02:05.969> into<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
just put the pole down into here it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.109 
just put the pole down into here it
allows<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.619> actual<00:02:07.950> microphone<00:02:08.520> stand<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
allows the actual microphone stand to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.020 
allows the actual microphone stand to
actually<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.709> 360<00:02:10.709> degrees<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.760> we're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
actually have a 360 degrees so we're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640 
actually have a 360 degrees so we're
on<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:12.990> wanted<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> give<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.470> guys

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
on it so I just wanted to give you guys

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.650 
on it so I just wanted to give you guys
a<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> demo<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.459> have<00:02:14.819> my<00:02:15.000> Road<00:02:15.240> NT

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
a bit of a demo now do have my Road NT

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.480 
a bit of a demo now do have my Road NT
USB<00:02:16.110> installed<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.770> mountain<00:02:17.069> currently

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
USB installed on the mountain currently

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.120 
USB installed on the mountain currently
and<00:02:17.700> basically<00:02:18.390> guys<00:02:18.630> look<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> said<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.230> 360

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
and basically guys look I said it's 360

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.650 
and basically guys look I said it's 360
degrees<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.640> basically<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.209> move<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
degrees so basically you can move the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.430 
degrees so basically you can move the
actual<00:02:21.780> studio<00:02:22.380> arm<00:02:23.270> 360<00:02:24.270> degrees<00:02:24.569> very<00:02:25.050> very

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
actual studio arm 360 degrees very very

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.500 
actual studio arm 360 degrees very very
freely<00:02:25.800> obviously<00:02:26.640> where<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.970> base<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.360> not

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
freely obviously where the base is not

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.479 
freely obviously where the base is not
mounted<00:02:27.750> whatsoever<00:02:28.530> where<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> base<00:02:29.280> is

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
mounted whatsoever where the base is

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.710 
mounted whatsoever where the base is
mounted<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> desk<00:02:30.270> by<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> way<00:02:30.660> you

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
mounted to the desk by the way you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.449 
mounted to the desk by the way you
actually<00:02:31.140> connect<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> actual<00:02:31.830> arm<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
actually connect the actual arm to the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.380 
actually connect the actual arm to the
base<00:02:32.970> mount

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
base mount

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.600 
base mount
there's<00:02:33.870> no<00:02:34.080> attachments<00:02:34.680> whatsoever<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.550> you

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
there's no attachments whatsoever so you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.280 
there's no attachments whatsoever so you
can<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.910> freely<00:02:36.209> move<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.750> wherever<00:02:36.959> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
can just freely move this wherever you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.350 
can just freely move this wherever you
like<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.730> easy<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.209> no

Novak<00:02:43.350> ting<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:43.890> really<00:02:44.340> really

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
Novak ting it's just really really

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.020 
Novak ting it's just really really
smooth<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> road<00:02:47.489> psa1

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
smooth as you can see so the road psa1

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.410 
smooth as you can see so the road psa1
also<00:02:48.690> allows<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.260> horizontal<00:02:49.590> reach<00:02:50.100> of

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
also allows for a horizontal reach of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.509 
also allows for a horizontal reach of
820<00:02:51.420> centimeters<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.200> basically<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.920> can

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
820 centimeters so basically I can

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.300 
820 centimeters so basically I can
really<00:02:53.760> tip<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.239> down<00:02:54.620> wherever<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.890> really

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
really tip this down wherever I really

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.590 
really tip this down wherever I really
want<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.790> using<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.450> actual

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
want it to go using the actual

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.479 
want it to go using the actual
mechanical<00:02:58.230> gear<00:02:58.530> space<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.310> I'll<00:02:59.370> just

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
mechanical gear space that I'll just

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.759 
mechanical gear space that I'll just
push<00:02:59.700> down<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.690> basically<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.680> you

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
push down on this and basically as you

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.320 
push down on this and basically as you
can<00:03:01.860> see<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> actual<00:03:02.250> microphone<00:03:02.819> is<00:03:03.000> almost

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
can see the actual microphone is almost

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.540 
can see the actual microphone is almost
laying<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:04.500> flat<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.370> go

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
laying down very very flat I can go

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.830 
laying down very very flat I can go
further<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.330> honest<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:06.690> really

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
further but to be honest don't really

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
further but to be honest don't really
need<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:07.980> far<00:03:08.160> as<00:03:08.220> vertical<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.000> can

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
need to and as far as vertical I can

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.759 
need to and as far as vertical I can
literally<00:03:09.600> if<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> microphone<00:03:10.200> up<00:03:10.319> as<00:03:10.470> far<00:03:10.739> as

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
literally if the microphone up as far as

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.560 
now I can kind of just lift it up move
out<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.890> way<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.340> do<00:04:33.850> what<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.030> like<00:04:34.210> with<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
and it doesn't really have to be in my

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.190 
and it doesn't really have to be in my
view<00:04:36.460> or<00:04:36.700> my<00:04:36.850> workspace<00:04:37.270> at<00:04:37.570> any<00:04:37.660> given<00:04:37.900> time

actually performed and it was actually

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.520 
actually performed and it was actually
surprising<00:04:43.060> how<00:04:43.180> easy<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.690> was<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.840> set<00:04:44.170> up<00:04:44.200> as

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
surprising how easy it was to set up as

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.560 
surprising how easy it was to set up as
well<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.250> hope<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.670> guys<00:04:45.760> enjoyed<00:04:46.150> my<00:04:46.180> video

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.550 
today on the road psa1 it's a superb
product<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.750> would<00:04:49.810> recommend<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.440> to

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
product and I would recommend it to

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.410 
product and I would recommend it to
anyone<00:04:50.770> out<00:04:50.950> there<00:04:50.980> who's<00:04:51.610> using<00:04:51.970> basically<00:04:52.330> a

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
anyone out there who's using basically a

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.540 
anyone out there who's using basically a
microphone<00:04:52.780> at<00:04:52.990> home<00:04:53.200> on<00:04:53.530> their<00:04:54.100> desk<00:04:54.310> and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
microphone at home on their desk and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.220 
microphone at home on their desk and
also<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.060> easy<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.420> take<00:04:55.540> apart<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.080> you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
also so easy to take apart that you

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.420 
also so easy to take apart that you
could<00:04:56.380> potentially<00:04:56.560> take<00:04:56.920> this<00:04:57.010> on<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.280> move

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
could potentially take this on the move

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.430 
could potentially take this on the move
as<00:04:57.610> well<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:58.420> let's<00:04:58.720> say<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.870> big<00:04:59.020> we<00:04:59.110> think<00:04:59.260> is<00:04:59.350> a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
as well so let's say a big we think is a

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.260 
as well so let's say a big we think is a
road<00:04:59.620> for<00:04:59.800> sending<00:05:00.070> out<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.430> me<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:00.730> unboxing
