00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.590
 for me the second wave

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.230
 concerning 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
 otherwise 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.660
 as it turns out 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.690

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 in this way 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.319
 why it was just impossible 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.269
 So 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.349
 the policeman 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:24.049

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 why do we have 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.869
 right 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.699

 there's no such thing 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.069
 in turn 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.109
