00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.610
 so welcome my third 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:13.040
 third bucket plugin tutorial 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:19.619
 today it's the plug in prius 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:23.250
 I do that with fabian and delicious 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.080
 kevin this plugin is like the theme 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 what dorfen server then shows the likes 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 is it because you can not from you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.469
 have the gop important still so yes 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 and especially for my audience I 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.780
 I am here to break everything down 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 ox and hopefully that's always 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 no bohemian series no the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 no matter the hawks goes with the house cat 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 that as well as we can do it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.859
 not because matt lacquered so tack if that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.619
 seen and it is a new 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:14.850
 saplings long tree is the extreme 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 cool and the hand is not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 So only with the orks and here at 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.009
 jungle tree that's right in the times 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.210
 year in the taco and so you see 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:32.040
 really much stuff as fast as possible 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.340
 more and earlier you knew that here 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.810
 all the time up to earth 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.250
 build up and with me 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 you also get much faster though 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 So mostly with me 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460
 always so i always sacrifice 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.939
 come 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 when building yes I believe the tutorial 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.549
 already was the end is simple, the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.369
 plug-in you do not have to configure anything 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.960
 in the packages because yes you can 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.350
 of course, but the configure 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.550
 actually that is unnecessary 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.550
 until then people stuck
