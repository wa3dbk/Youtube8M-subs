00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.770 
it was so simple to get the emeralds I
was<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.730> thinking<00:03:11.969> this<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> funny<00:03:12.480> mom<00:03:12.689> I

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
was just thinking this is a funny mom I

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.539 
was just thinking this is a funny mom I
know<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.079> small<00:03:13.260> mod<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.950> usually<00:03:14.489> I

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
know it's a small mod and usually I

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.069 
know it's a small mod and usually I
don't<00:03:14.730> try<00:03:14.939> to<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.180> these<00:03:15.299> ones<00:03:15.569> into<00:03:15.989> my

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
don't try to get these ones into my

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.959 
don't try to get these ones into my
modded<00:03:16.409> survival<00:03:16.669> but<00:03:17.669> I<00:03:17.730> thought<00:03:17.849> it'd<00:03:17.939> be

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
modded survival but I thought it'd be

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.520 
modded survival but I thought it'd be
really<00:03:18.060> funny<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.689> an<00:03:18.750> episode<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.139> two<00:03:19.260> if<00:03:19.469> I

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
really funny for an episode or two if I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
probably the most important thing to

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.649 
probably the most important thing to
make<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:49.979> empty<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.849> for<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.509> it's

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
make is the empty can and for that it's

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.479 
make is the empty can and for that it's
iron<00:03:51.930> ingots<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.829> get<00:03:52.979> four<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.340> those

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.979 
iron ingots and you get four of those
and<00:03:53.939> then<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.120> could<00:03:54.299> take<00:03:54.509> it<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.810> basically

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
and then you could take it and basically

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.740 
and then you could take it and basically
combine<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.769> with<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.979> meat<00:03:56.189> I<00:03:56.540> hear<00:03:57.540> them

all right think we're starting to starve
to<00:04:23.250> death<00:04:23.340> here<00:04:23.639> so<00:04:24.539> let<00:04:24.750> us<00:04:24.780> try<00:04:25.280> normal

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
to death here so let us try normal

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.779 
to death here so let us try normal
strange<00:04:26.550> meat<00:04:27.830> alright<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:28.979> obviously<00:04:29.370> it

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
strange meat alright so obviously it

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.279 
strange meat alright so obviously it
gives<00:04:29.909> you<00:04:30.120> back<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.389> little<00:04:30.690> bit<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.990> hunger

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
gives you back a little bit of hunger

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.340 
gives you back a little bit of hunger
but<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:32.610> get<00:04:32.880> nausea<00:04:33.870> that's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
but you get nausea that's

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.280 
but you get nausea that's
not<00:04:34.590> good<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.310> think<00:04:35.430> my<00:04:35.970> hunger<00:04:36.420> is<00:04:36.630> even

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
not good and I think my hunger is even

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.820 
not good and I think my hunger is even
worse<00:04:37.470> now<00:04:38.330> all<00:04:39.330> right<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:39.570> let's<00:04:39.750> try<00:04:40.020> out<00:04:40.320> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
worse now all right so let's try out the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.010 
worse now all right so let's try out the
meat<00:04:41.040> can<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.330> if<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:42.480> combine<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.810> you'd

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
meat can so if you combine it you'd

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.810 
meat can so if you combine it you'd
think<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.530> would<00:04:43.650> get<00:04:43.800> better<00:04:44.040> but<00:04:44.730> it

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
think it would get better but it

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.790 
think it would get better but it
actually<00:04:45.210> gets<00:04:45.390> worse<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.990> gives<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.410> nausea

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
