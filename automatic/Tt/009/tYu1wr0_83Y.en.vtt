and Ty it's got good leg strength and
both<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:31.950> body<00:01:32.189> position<00:01:32.400> or

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
both of them in a good body position or

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
both of them in a good body position or
two<00:01:32.880> different<00:01:33.150> body<00:01:33.329> types<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.200> yet<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> can

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
two different body types but yet you can

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
two different body types but yet you can
see<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.040> both<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.250> them<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.700> used<00:01:35.909> their

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
see that both of them have used their

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
see that both of them have used their
body<00:01:36.270> completely<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.259> explosion<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> not

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
body completely the explosion is not

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
body completely the explosion is not
based<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> fact<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.390> whether<00:01:39.600> we're<00:01:39.869> big

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
based on the fact that whether we're big

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.410 
based on the fact that whether we're big
or<00:01:40.229> small<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.130> explosion<00:01:41.759> comes<00:01:42.060> from<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
or small the explosion comes from the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
or small the explosion comes from the
courage<00:01:42.750> within<00:01:43.049> our<00:01:43.200> athlete<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> perform

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
courage within our athlete to perform

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
courage within our athlete to perform
but<00:01:44.790> also<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> particular

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
but also to work at this particular

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
but also to work at this particular
technique<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.579> particular

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
technique and in this particular

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
technique and in this particular
emphasis<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.259> explosion<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.310> also<00:01:50.549> very

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
emphasis on explosion it's also very

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
emphasis on explosion it's also very
good<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.299> us<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:51.869> we're<00:01:51.990> talking<00:01:52.110> about

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
good for us when we're talking about

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
good for us when we're talking about
tackling<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.640> getting<00:01:53.850> pretty<00:01:54.210> close

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
tackling so we're getting pretty close

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.389 
tackling so we're getting pretty close
to<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.750> idea<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.500> being<00:01:55.649> able<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> good

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to that idea of being able to get a good

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.830 
to that idea of being able to get a good
lift<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> sink<00:01:57.060> our<00:01:57.180> hips<00:01:57.360> into<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> man

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
lift and sink our hips into the man

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
lift and sink our hips into the man
we're<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> tackle<00:01:58.710> okay

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
we're going to make the tackle okay

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
we're going to make the tackle okay
let's<00:01:59.820> try<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.060> again<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:01.049> right<00:02:01.229> let's<00:02:01.439> take
