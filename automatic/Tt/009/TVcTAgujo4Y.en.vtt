 I come to bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.250
 jetas how uncomfortable ride online

 totally drunk all over the map and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 whether you are driving or on foot but 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.500
 Well first of all, they already know how to give it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.910
 like to this video that helps me 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 impels a lot to keep going up 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.180
 videos like these memories allows 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.309
 what are social networks and the channel 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.110
 to not miss any video now that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.760
 we occupied we occupied a few things already 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.949
 whether you're in a public game or 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 only by invitation but we occupy being 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.390
 inside what is our garage ok 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 let's go to what the kitchen is and let's go 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 to find a small bottle of wine 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.949
 on a table and well let's start 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.170
 take about five glasses to 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.540
 start looking at that little blur and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.100
 that little distortion in the view we're going 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.479
 to start looking at this on the screen or 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.129
 that this is for people who do not 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.489
 they know how you look with the backs but 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 then since we take more or less 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.380
 5 glasses of these wine we are going to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.960
 start looking at that effect now let's 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 go quickly to what is the room there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 let's start good let's find 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.790
 more rather said 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 a bottle of a put ok is where 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 can you smoke let's give it a little 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 touch are to this I do not know if it's a motorcycle 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.540
 have that mother but well, come on 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 quickly to what is the output of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.619
 our department and well here we go 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 to start looking at what is removed 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.360
 that is the little blur that is no longer 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 you look at the view as well as you did not speak 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 now only the effect that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 the monkey as well as drunk 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.009
 but well here we can start 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.569
 because to walk on the street looks like this 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.970
 like how weird the monkey like that 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.590
 falling down or whether we want to run 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.000
 when we run in me they should be funny 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 because the monkey starts like that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 wobble a bit the truth is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.000
 very cured I liked it very much very much 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.409
 what this effect so they can 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.970
 tolerate what all your friends are here 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.130
 I tried to get into the vehicle I can not 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.729
 I do not know why he left I did not get on 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.350
 he listened 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.330
 here one comes to climb it 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.789
 just because I'm going to start driving 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.149
 and they're going to start looking at the effect the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.760
 which one 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.680
 because it caused when he forgave us 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.540
 handles as well as that sideways like that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 everything in zig-zag assists begins to move 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.680
 the car in truth I try to go 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 right but look in the car it goes like this 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.560
 like that for the sides here collided 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.569
 Normally, but I hope you have 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.700
 liked this video remember to like 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.170
 that helps me a lot motivates me 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.340
 keep uploading videos like these 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.959
 I remember avoiding what is a network 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.269
 social and to the channel not to get lost 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.159
