megapixel<00:00:23.590> ultra<00:00:24.250> pixel<00:00:24.400> right<00:00:24.760> there<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.119> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
megapixel ultra pixel right there on the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.939 
megapixel ultra pixel right there on the
front<00:00:25.510> then<00:00:26.140> we've<00:00:26.260> got<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.440> boom<00:00:26.619> sound

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949

speakers here and now this this is
actually<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:31.019> fingerprint<00:00:32.019> sensor<00:00:32.319> for

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
actually a fingerprint sensor for

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.709 
actually a fingerprint sensor for
unlocking<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> device<00:00:33.550> super<00:00:34.239> excited<00:00:34.629> to

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
unlocking the device super excited to

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.660 
unlocking the device super excited to
have<00:00:34.899> that<00:00:34.929> and<00:00:35.859> I'll<00:00:35.949> have<00:00:36.069> to<00:00:36.190> test<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.640> out

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
have that and I'll have to test that out

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.090 
have that and I'll have to test that out
to<00:00:37.120> know<00:00:37.329> exactly<00:00:38.139> how<00:00:38.229> quick<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.649> is<00:00:38.710> but<00:00:38.949> it

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
to know exactly how quick it is but it

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.489 
to know exactly how quick it is but it
feels<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.699> little<00:00:40.059> recessed<00:00:40.659> into<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.019> handset

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:41.499 
feels a little recessed into the handset

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.329 
feels a little recessed into the handset
which<00:00:41.739> is<00:00:42.039> actually<00:00:42.789> quite<00:00:43.210> nice<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:44.339> all

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
which is actually quite nice and all

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.189 
which is actually quite nice and all
around<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:46.149> entire<00:00:46.479> front<00:00:46.749> of<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.929> speaker

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
around the entire front of the speaker

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.579 
around the entire front of the speaker
just<00:00:47.289> feels<00:00:47.769> really<00:00:48.670> luxury<00:00:49.469> exactly<00:00:50.469> the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
just feels really luxury exactly the

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.709 
just feels really luxury exactly the
same<00:00:50.799> as<00:00:50.949> you<00:00:51.039> have<00:00:51.190> with<00:00:51.429> the<00:00:51.579> m9<00:00:51.999> so<00:00:52.389> you<00:00:52.449> see

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
same as you have with the m9 so you see

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.479 
same as you have with the m9 so you see
that<00:00:52.839> there's<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.229> little<00:00:53.499> ledge<00:00:53.679> there<00:00:54.010> we

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
that there's the little ledge there we

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.610 
that there's the little ledge there we
have<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.819> two-tone<00:00:55.269> coloring<00:00:55.929> we<00:00:56.379> have<00:00:56.530> the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
have the two-tone coloring we have the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.489 
have the two-tone coloring we have the
same<00:00:56.829> setup<00:00:57.100> on<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.429> side<00:00:57.670> with<00:00:57.999> the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
same setup on the side with the

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.750 
same setup on the side with the
texturized<00:00:59.499> power<00:00:59.799> button<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.190> seperated

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
texturized power button the seperated

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.090 
texturized power button the seperated
volume<00:01:01.119> rocker<00:01:01.389> there<00:01:02.019> we've<00:01:02.260> got<00:01:02.499> I<00:01:02.709> believe

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
volume rocker there we've got I believe

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.670 
volume rocker there we've got I believe
that's<00:01:03.429> the<00:01:03.639> micro<00:01:04.449> SD<00:01:04.809> card<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.410> then<00:01:05.530> this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
that's the micro SD card and then this

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.490 
that's the micro SD card and then this
is<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.100> SIM<00:01:06.550> card<00:01:06.580> well<00:01:07.240> either<00:01:07.420> way<00:01:07.660> one<00:01:08.410> of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
is the SIM card well either way one of

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.900 
is the SIM card well either way one of
those<00:01:08.620> on<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.920> back<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.520> back<00:01:09.670> here<00:01:09.880> we

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
those on the back so on the back here we

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.360 
those on the back so on the back here we
actually<00:01:10.150> have<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:11.170> duo<00:01:11.380> camera<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:12.160> this<00:01:12.280> is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
actually have the duo camera so this is

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.860 
actually have the duo camera so this is
the<00:01:12.490> depth<00:01:12.670> sensing<00:01:13.000> camera<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.510> we<00:01:13.600> had<00:01:13.750> on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
the depth sensing camera that we had on

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.170 
the depth sensing camera that we had on
the<00:01:13.990> Mk<00:01:14.440> except<00:01:15.160> for<00:01:15.370> instead<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.850> ultra

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
the Mk except for instead of the ultra

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.790 
the Mk except for instead of the ultra
pixel<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:16.720> have<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.930> 20<00:01:17.230> megapixel<00:01:17.350> shooter

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
pixel we have a 20 megapixel shooter

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.410 
pixel we have a 20 megapixel shooter
there<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.760> can<00:01:18.880> see<00:01:18.970> that<00:01:19.000> we've<00:01:19.210> got<00:01:19.330> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
there you can see that we've got the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.810 
there you can see that we've got the
two-tone<00:01:19.870> flash<00:01:20.230> and<00:01:20.800> we<00:01:21.370> have<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.640> same

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
two-tone flash and we have the same

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.510 
two-tone flash and we have the same
overall<00:01:22.270> design<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.750> we<00:01:22.870> have<00:01:23.050> on<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.890> m9

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
overall design that we have on the m9

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.940 
overall design that we have on the m9
now<00:01:25.300> at<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.570> top<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.560> kind<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
now at the top you have that kind of

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.860 
now at the top you have that kind of
plastic<00:01:27.610> key<00:01:28.440> section<00:01:29.440> for<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> IR<00:01:30.310> blaster

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
plastic key section for the IR blaster

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.590 
plastic key section for the IR blaster
and<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.040> actually<00:01:33.370> running<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.910> mediatek

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
and this is actually running a mediatek

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.070 
and this is actually running a mediatek
processor<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.620> Helio<00:01:36.040> x10<00:01:37.080> 2.2

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
processor this is the Helio x10 2.2

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.350 
processor this is the Helio x10 2.2
gigahertz<00:01:38.980> and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> actually<00:01:39.430> did<00:01:39.700> run<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:39.940> 2<00:01:40.150> 2

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
gigahertz and I actually did run on 2 2

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.130 
gigahertz and I actually did run on 2 2
on<00:01:40.510> this<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:40.900> we<00:01:41.050> had<00:01:41.230> a<00:01:41.260> score<00:01:41.620> of<00:01:41.710> about

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
on this so we had a score of about

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.350 
on this so we had a score of about
44,000<00:01:44.140> which<00:01:44.470> isn't<00:01:44.920> bad<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.700> mid-range

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
44,000 which isn't bad for a mid-range

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.940 
44,000 which isn't bad for a mid-range
device<00:01:46.930> now<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.290> comes<00:01:47.470> with<00:01:47.620> a<00:01:47.680> bunch<00:01:47.800> of

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
device now it comes with a bunch of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.840 
device now it comes with a bunch of
things<00:01:48.159> like<00:01:48.659> NFC<00:01:49.659> DLNA<00:01:50.530> or<00:01:51.430> another<00:01:51.700> thing

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
things like NFC DLNA or another thing

actually you can see the texture there I
mean<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.070> sharp<00:02:11.370> as<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.240> would<00:02:12.420> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it comes to questionable lighting I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.340 
it comes to questionable lighting I
always<00:02:53.700> thought<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:53.970> HTC<00:02:54.450> did<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> really

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
always thought that HTC did a really

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.199 
always thought that HTC did a really
good<00:02:55.709> job<00:02:55.770> with<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> ultra<00:02:56.700> pixel<00:02:56.850> camera

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
good job with the ultra pixel camera

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.820 
good job with the ultra pixel camera
especially<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.959> low<00:02:58.080> light<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.739> this

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
especially in low light you can see this

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.760 
especially in low light you can see this
is<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.250> bit<00:02:59.370> noisy<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:01.110> overall<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.500> mean

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
is a little bit noisy but overall I mean

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.259 
is a little bit noisy but overall I mean
it's<00:03:01.920> not<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.250> bad<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.610> something<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.090> like

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
it's not too bad for something with like

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.300 
it's not too bad for something with like
bright<00:03:03.660> spotlights<00:03:04.140> coming<00:03:04.500> from<00:03:05.070> all

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
directions some of the one thing that I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.890 
directions some of the one thing that I
do<00:03:08.280> wish<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.640> they<00:03:08.970> had<00:03:09.150> changes<00:03:09.600> if<00:03:09.780> they

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
do wish that they had changes if they

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.660 
do wish that they had changes if they
put<00:03:10.170> these<00:03:10.350> software<00:03:10.799> buttons<00:03:11.130> down<00:03:11.340> here

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
put these software buttons down here

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.210 
put these software buttons down here
onto<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.480> row<00:03:12.750> making<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.320> device<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.799> lot

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
onto this row making the device a lot

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.449 
onto this row making the device a lot
less<00:03:14.640> tall<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.410> has<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> two<00:03:16.890> thousand<00:03:17.340> eight

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
less tall so it has a two thousand eight

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.580 
less tall so it has a two thousand eight
