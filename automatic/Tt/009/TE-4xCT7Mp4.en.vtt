 formula and collagen after people know that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.140
 We have to start with color because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.829
 prevented from doing so well above precocious 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.140
 cells 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.320
 the collagen that will be taking care of the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.149
