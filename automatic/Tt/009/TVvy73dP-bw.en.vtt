00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.589 
i think the possibilities for the games
are<00:01:52.250> extremely<00:01:52.759> exciting<00:01:53.209> and<00:01:53.329> i'm<00:01:53.390> thrilled

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599

for the whole project well i gotta say i

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.760 
for the whole project well i gotta say i
just<00:01:55.819> tried<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.390> oculus<00:01:56.840> prototype<00:01:57.349> and<00:01:57.619> it

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
just tried the oculus prototype and it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.949 
just tried the oculus prototype and it
was<00:01:57.920> such<00:01:58.189> an<00:01:58.459> immersive<00:01:58.819> amazing<00:01:59.509> experience

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
was such an immersive amazing experience

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.380 
was such an immersive amazing experience
that<00:02:00.709> we<00:02:00.950> pretty<00:02:01.369> quickly<00:02:01.670> like<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.299> an

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
that we pretty quickly like it in an

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.999 
that we pretty quickly like it in an
hour<00:02:02.509> decided<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.170> get<00:02:03.289> behind<00:02:03.469> this<00:02:03.770> project

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
hour decided to get behind this project

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.309 
hour decided to get behind this project
I<00:02:04.429> got<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:04.939> meet<00:02:05.030> Palmer<00:02:05.329> Luckey<00:02:05.599> and<00:02:05.929> try<00:02:06.200> out

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
I got to meet Palmer Luckey and try out

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.440 
I got to meet Palmer Luckey and try out
the<00:02:06.500> oculus<00:02:06.920> rift<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.459> I<00:02:07.849> have<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.090> say<00:02:08.239> is<00:02:08.360> a

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the oculus rift and I have to say is a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.999 
the oculus rift and I have to say is a
very<00:02:08.660> exciting<00:02:08.959> moment<00:02:09.140> could<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
very exciting moment could be the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.710 
very exciting moment could be the
beginning<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.489> whole<00:02:10.640> new<00:02:10.700> industry<00:02:11.360> that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
beginning of a whole new industry that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.630 
beginning of a whole new industry that
leads<00:02:12.140> us<00:02:12.319> eventually<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:13.069> having<00:02:13.400> true

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
leads us eventually to having true

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.089 
leads us eventually to having true
augmentation<00:02:14.269> all<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.230> time<00:02:15.440> every<00:02:15.739> place

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
augmentation all the time every place

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.280 
augmentation all the time every place
and<00:02:16.610> I'm<00:02:17.299> really<00:02:17.540> looking<00:02:17.750> forward<00:02:18.230> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and I'm really looking forward to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.140 
and I'm really looking forward to
getting<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.620> chance<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:19.099> program<00:02:19.579> with<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
getting a chance to program with it and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.750 
getting a chance to program with it and
see<00:02:20.810> what<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.049> can<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:21.709> looks<00:02:21.889> incredibly

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
see what we can do it looks incredibly

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
see what we can do it looks incredibly
exciting<00:02:23.420> if<00:02:23.690> anybody's<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.440> tackle

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
exciting if anybody's going to tackle

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.309 
exciting if anybody's going to tackle
the<00:02:25.069> set<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.489> hard<00:02:25.730> problems<00:02:26.299> we<00:02:27.019> think<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the set of hard problems we think the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.319 
the set of hard problems we think the
Palmer<00:02:27.590> is<00:02:27.769> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:28.970> strongly

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
Kickstarter in the past I've looked at

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.839 
Kickstarter in the past I've looked at
these<00:02:33.470> VR<00:02:33.980> headsets<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.700> head-mounted

these VR headsets and head-mounted

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.569 
these VR headsets and head-mounted
displays<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:36.109> this<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.889> the<00:02:37.010> first<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
displays and this is the first one that

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.949 
displays and this is the first one that
I've<00:02:37.730> seen<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.209> was<00:02:38.450> truly<00:02:38.720> impressed

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
displays out there but they're all

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
displays out there but they're all
really<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:43.190> expensive<00:02:43.459> up<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.239> over<00:02:44.480> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
hundred thousand dollars what the riff

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
hundred thousand dollars what the riff
does<00:02:46.669> is<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.359> makes<00:02:47.389> a<00:02:47.690> high-end<00:02:48.109> virtual

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470

problems with virtual reality up to this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.770 
problems with virtual reality up to this
point<00:03:21.049> is<00:03:21.319> latency<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:23.060> benefit<00:03:23.419> of<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.630> rift

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
point is latency the benefit of the rift

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.420 
point is latency the benefit of the rift
is<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.169> it's<00:03:24.290> designed<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.769> be<00:03:24.859> really

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
is that it's designed to be really

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.660 
is that it's designed to be really
really<00:03:25.700> low<00:03:26.060> latency<00:03:26.659> so<00:03:27.079> rather<00:03:27.439> than

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
really low latency so rather than

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.459 
really low latency so rather than
looking<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.909> this<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.719> you<00:03:29.780> turn<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.290> head

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
looking like this and you turn your head

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.900 
looking like this and you turn your head
and<00:03:30.709> then<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:30.950> follows

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
and then it follows

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.300 
and then it follows
it<00:03:32.090> actually<00:03:32.330> follows<00:03:32.960> with<00:03:33.260> your<00:03:33.500> view<00:03:33.770> no

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
it actually follows with your view no

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.070 
it actually follows with your view no
matter<00:03:34.490> what<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.790> do<00:03:35.060> there<00:03:35.810> are<00:03:35.840> two<00:03:35.960> reasons

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
matter what you do there are two reasons

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.160 
matter what you do there are two reasons
why<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.340> possible<00:03:37.880> now<00:03:38.030> with<00:03:38.300> oculus<00:03:38.660> is

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
why this is possible now with oculus is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.170 
why this is possible now with oculus is
that<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.650> displays<00:03:40.070> are<00:03:40.280> very<00:03:40.460> high<00:03:40.640> density

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
that the displays are very high density

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.540 
that the displays are very high density
and<00:03:41.330> very<00:03:41.630> lightweight<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.500> are<00:03:43.010> very<00:03:43.160> small

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
and very lightweight and are very small

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.300 
and very lightweight and are very small
and<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:44.570> sensors<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.470> sense<00:03:45.860> your<00:03:46.160> head

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
and the sensors that sense your head

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.590 
and the sensors that sense your head
position<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.970> you're<00:03:47.090> turning<00:03:47.300> in<00:03:47.570> your

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
position and you're turning in your

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.480 
position and you're turning in your
virtual<00:03:48.110> environment<00:03:48.620> also<00:03:48.800> very<00:03:49.160> low-cost

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
virtual environment also very low-cost

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.640 
virtual environment also very low-cost
the<00:03:50.270> reason<00:03:50.480> we're<00:03:50.570> using<00:03:50.600> Kickstarter<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
the reason we're using Kickstarter is so

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530 
the reason we're using Kickstarter is so
that<00:03:51.770> we<00:03:51.830> can<00:03:52.010> get<00:03:52.190> these<00:03:52.370> dev<00:03:52.670> kits<00:03:53.000> into<00:03:53.300> the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
that we can get these dev kits into the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.090 
that we can get these dev kits into the
hands<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.900> developers<00:03:54.050> as<00:03:54.560> fast<00:03:54.860> as<00:03:55.040> possible

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
hands of developers as fast as possible

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.400 
hands of developers as fast as possible
that<00:03:56.030> way<00:03:56.120> they<00:03:56.240> can<00:03:56.390> try<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:56.660> themselves<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
that way they can try for themselves and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.230 
that way they can try for themselves and
start<00:03:58.100> integrating<00:03:58.280> support<00:03:58.910> into<00:03:59.120> their

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
start integrating support into their

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.180 
start integrating support into their
games<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.660> engines<00:04:00.020> we<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.100> need

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
games and engines we really need

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.220 
games and engines we really need
developer<00:04:01.820> feedback<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.630> we<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:03.020> make

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
developer feedback so that we can make

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.320 
developer feedback so that we can make
the<00:04:03.380> consumer<00:04:03.830> version<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.430> even<00:04:05.030> more

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the consumer version of this even more

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.750 
the consumer version of this even more
incredible<00:04:05.510> than<00:04:05.960> it<00:04:06.200> already<00:04:06.320> is<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.980> mean<00:04:07.670> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
incredible than it already is I mean the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
incredible than it already is I mean the
greatest<00:04:08.210> decay<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.810> simply<00:04:09.500> about<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:10.130> great

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
greatest decay is simply about a great

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.750 
greatest decay is simply about a great
developer<00:04:11.780> experience<00:04:12.140> where<00:04:12.920> they<00:04:13.550> get<00:04:13.730> a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
developer experience where they get a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.220 
developer experience where they get a
really<00:04:14.090> functional<00:04:14.360> piece<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.810> software

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
really functional piece of software

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.410 
really functional piece of software
which<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.830> efficient<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.489> skills<00:04:16.850> they<00:04:17.150> need

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
which is efficient and skills they need

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.840 
which is efficient and skills they need
so<00:04:18.170> for<00:04:18.380> any<00:04:18.500> developers<00:04:19.190> doing<00:04:19.730> this
