00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 welcome back to the second 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.650
 mba tutorial in this case I'm going to 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.020
 teach how to do slow motion and 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 superimpose two videos at the same time 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.720
 well let's go directly to what the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720
 slow motion 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.220
 I gave up but failed but it kills me 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 well we want to do now 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.010
 is that this part is trimmed 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 it becomes even faster 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.540
 so what do we do we go to the extreme 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.210
 we keep tight control 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.210
 and we shrink served 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.009
 now notice how it varies in speed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.009
 less 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 going back to the case that we want 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.230
 make it slower good we do the same 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.230
 process and we tighten control and stretch 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.280
 Now, look how it looks 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.280
 yes 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.280
 if not 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.280
 in gascue my life 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.020
 well I hope it would be the motion 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.179
 and its counterpart within the videos 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.170
 for what I'm going to explain it goes to 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.930
 be it 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.909
 it's going to be superimposing two videos at the same 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.830
 good time now I'm going to move on to 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.830
 explain how to superimpose the videos 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 good that we have the track weakness 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.490
 but we just have the other clue 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.460
 bank 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.190
 in this case you can not see the video of 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.810
 down then what do we do good inside 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.360
 of the video track that we have 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.130
 where it says level that is 100 per 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 we lower it and we're going 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.620
 decreasing 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.920
 look up like changing the look 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 of mixing in the videos 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.230
 Once this is done, we click on it 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:53.120
 I like it more 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.510
 yes 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.599
 well this can superimpose videos of the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 easiest way slow motion and its 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.200
 counterpart 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.980
 and I hope to see you in the next tutorial 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 of hamlet 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 do not 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.920
 in my mind
