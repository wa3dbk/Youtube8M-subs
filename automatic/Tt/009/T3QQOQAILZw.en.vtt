tremor and so what we needed to do is we
needed<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.970> violin<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> operating<00:01:58.110> room

I<00:02:59.310> started<00:03:00.310> playing<00:03:00.720> right<00:03:01.720> away<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.200> day<00:03:02.379> I

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
I started playing right away the day I

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:09.750 
I started playing right away the day I
came<00:03:02.560> home<00:03:02.799> from<00:03:03.790> mail

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.880 

I<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:12.040> back<00:03:12.970> playing<00:03:13.330> with<00:03:13.480> my<00:03:14.440> colleagues

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
I was back playing with my colleagues

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.070 
I was back playing with my colleagues
with<00:03:15.099> mints<00:03:15.370> at<00:03:15.549> Orchestra<00:03:15.879> three<00:03:16.840> weeks

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
tremor is quite pronounced you can see

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.110 
tremor is quite pronounced you can see
the<00:03:26.349> difference<00:03:26.830> with<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.549> click<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:27.940> a
