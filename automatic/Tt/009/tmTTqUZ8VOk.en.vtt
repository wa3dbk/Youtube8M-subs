I'm going to do a quick talk through

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.430 
I'm going to do a quick talk through
light<00:00:09.640> writing<00:00:10.180> which<00:00:10.630> is<00:00:10.870> something<00:00:11.170> that<00:00:11.410> a

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
light writing which is something that a

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.980 
light writing which is something that a
lot<00:00:11.500> of<00:00:11.650> people<00:00:11.980> are<00:00:12.070> interested<00:00:12.309> in<00:00:12.930> but<00:00:13.930> you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
lot of people are interested in but you

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.930 
lot of people are interested in but you
basically<00:00:14.320> did<00:00:14.530> you<00:00:14.710> use<00:00:14.890> a<00:00:14.920> long<00:00:15.190> exposure<00:00:15.610> on

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
basically did you use a long exposure on

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.700 
basically did you use a long exposure on
your<00:00:16.090> image<00:00:16.390> it's<00:00:16.810> capturing<00:00:17.260> light<00:00:17.500> the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
your image it's capturing light the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.480 
your image it's capturing light the
whole<00:00:17.890> time

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
whole time

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.519 
whole time
use<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:18.970> light<00:00:19.330> like<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.110> one<00:00:20.260> that<00:00:20.410> I'm<00:00:20.500> using

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
use a light like the one that I'm using

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.970 
use a light like the one that I'm using
is<00:00:20.920> this<00:00:21.130> it's<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.640> pen<00:00:21.849> light<00:00:22.680> don't<00:00:23.680> use<00:00:23.860> the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
is this it's a pen light don't use the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.400 
is this it's a pen light don't use the
laser<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.490> laser<00:00:24.730> can<00:00:25.029> damage<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.630> center<00:00:26.290> of

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
laser a laser can damage the center of

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.150 
laser a laser can damage the center of
the<00:00:26.680> camera<00:00:27.669> just<00:00:28.329> like<00:00:28.509> how<00:00:29.040> people<00:00:30.040> they

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
the camera just like how people they

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.470 
the camera just like how people they
don't<00:00:30.310> point<00:00:30.610> your<00:00:30.700> camera<00:00:30.910> at<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.239> Sun

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
don't point your camera at the Sun

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.600 
don't point your camera at the Sun
because<00:00:31.660> it'll<00:00:31.989> damage<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.470> sensor<00:00:32.680> same

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
because it'll damage the sensor same

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.310 
because it'll damage the sensor same
sort<00:00:33.850> of<00:00:33.880> thing<00:00:34.030> with<00:00:34.149> a<00:00:34.180> laser<00:00:34.420> so<00:00:34.780> just<00:00:35.170> use

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
sort of thing with a laser so just use

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.620 
sort of thing with a laser so just use
one<00:00:35.530> that's<00:00:35.739> it's<00:00:36.520> got<00:00:36.760> like<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:36.940> light<00:00:37.239> on<00:00:37.450> the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
one that's it's got like a light on the

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.810 
one that's it's got like a light on the
end<00:00:37.720> you<00:00:38.559> can<00:00:38.710> use<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.859> torch<00:00:39.190> as<00:00:39.399> well<00:00:39.579> but<00:00:39.760> a

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
end you can use a torch as well but a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.970 
end you can use a torch as well but a
torch<00:00:40.059> is<00:00:40.269> obviously<00:00:41.019> a<00:00:41.109> very<00:00:41.320> big<00:00:41.350> light<00:00:41.739> it

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
torch is obviously a very big light it

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.529 
torch is obviously a very big light it
likes<00:00:42.219> a<00:00:42.399> lot<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.670> area<00:00:43.059> around<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.449> as

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
likes a lot of the area around it as

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.500 
likes a lot of the area around it as
well<00:00:43.570> says<00:00:43.930> noise<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.530> best<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:45.460> picture<00:00:46.420> is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
well says noise the best the picture is

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.060 
well says noise the best the picture is
being<00:00:46.719> taken<00:00:46.989> for<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.469> long<00:00:47.649> amount<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:48.010> time

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
being taken for a long amount of time

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.540 
being taken for a long amount of time
and<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.899> processing<00:00:50.559> all<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.949> light<00:00:51.190> that's

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
and it's processing all the light that's

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.369 
and it's processing all the light that's
that's<00:00:51.910> happening<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.809> image<00:00:53.170> if<00:00:53.350> you

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
that's happening in that image if you

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.200 
that's happening in that image if you
ever<00:00:53.620> see<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.949> ones<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.460> I've<00:00:54.550> done<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.760> or

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
ever see the ones that I've done of or

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.509 
ever see the ones that I've done of or
that<00:00:55.539> anyone's<00:00:55.870> done<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.230> cars<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.309> traffic

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
that anyone's done of cars and traffic

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.099 
that anyone's done of cars and traffic
moving<00:00:57.999> along<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:58.929> their

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
moving along and you see their

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.829 
moving along and you see their
headlights<00:00:59.469> look<00:00:59.859> like<00:01:00.039> a<00:01:00.070> line<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.839> light

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
headlights look like a line of light

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.989 
headlights look like a line of light
movement<00:01:02.379> they<00:01:02.589> don't<00:01:02.800> look<00:01:03.309> like<00:01:03.370> headlights

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
movement they don't look like headlights

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.030 
movement they don't look like headlights
moving<00:01:04.480> along<00:01:04.690> bit<00:01:04.900> by<00:01:05.050> bit<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.620> see<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.950> as

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
moving along bit by bit you see it as

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.250 
moving along bit by bit you see it as
one<00:01:06.250> long<00:01:06.520> streak<00:01:06.909> that's<00:01:07.540> basically<00:01:07.990> because

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
one long streak that's basically because

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.020 
one long streak that's basically because
the<00:01:08.440> camera<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:08.800> just<00:01:09.100> taking<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.790> light

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
the camera is just taking in that light

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.090 
the camera is just taking in that light
constantly<00:01:10.750> it's<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.410> same<00:01:11.650> sort<00:01:11.830> of<00:01:11.890> thing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
constantly it's the same sort of thing

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.680 
constantly it's the same sort of thing
with<00:01:12.220> this<00:01:12.340> except<00:01:12.700> we're<00:01:12.850> telling<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.390> what

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
with this except we're telling it what

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.140 
with this except we're telling it what
light<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.860> take<00:01:15.040> in<00:01:15.280> we're<00:01:15.550> only<00:01:15.730> giving<00:01:16.060> it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
light to take in we're only giving it

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.170 
light to take in we're only giving it
one<00:01:16.360> source<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.750> light<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.320> look<00:01:17.500> from<00:01:17.800> so<00:01:18.730> what

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
one source of light to look from so what

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.470 
one source of light to look from so what
I'm<00:01:19.330> in<00:01:19.720> I'm<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.800> manual<00:01:21.190> mode<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.270> if

I'm in I'm in the manual mode so if
we've<00:01:22.660> got<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> camera<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.650> on<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.010> manual<00:01:24.400> and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
we've got the camera so on to manual and

we've got the camera so on to manual and
as<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.660> can<00:01:25.750> see<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.110> screen<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.470> very<00:01:26.710> very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
as you can see the screen is very very

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.280 
as you can see the screen is very very
bright<00:01:27.100> because<00:01:27.490> I've<00:01:27.610> got<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:27.880> set<00:01:28.210> for<00:01:28.600> for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
bright because I've got it set for for

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.460 
bright because I've got it set for for
light<00:01:29.470> writing<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.720> if<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:31.990> can't<00:01:32.200> see<00:01:32.260> this

light writing so if you can't see this

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.620 
light writing so if you can't see this
very<00:01:32.530> well<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.520> looks<00:01:33.910> dark<00:01:34.180> because<00:01:34.480> the

that the camera let you do I've got my
aperture<00:01:43.900> all<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.200> way<00:01:44.320> down<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:45.190> I've<00:01:45.340> got

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
aperture all the way down and I've got

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.910 
aperture all the way down and I've got
my<00:01:45.640> eye<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.900> can't<00:01:47.230> control<00:01:47.440> my<00:01:47.620> ISO

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
my eye on so I can't control my ISO

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.370 
my eye on so I can't control my ISO
because<00:01:48.160> my<00:01:48.340> shutter<00:01:48.640> speed<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:49.300> all<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.260> way

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
because my shutter speed is all the way

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.680 
because my shutter speed is all the way
down<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.770> doesn't<00:01:50.920> let<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.190> do<00:01:51.370> now<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.210> lot<00:01:52.660> of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
down it doesn't let you do now a lot of

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.450 
down it doesn't let you do now a lot of
people<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.080> been<00:01:53.200> asking<00:01:53.380> about<00:01:53.860> something

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
people have been asking about something

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.830 
people have been asking about something
called<00:01:54.840> CD<00:01:56.070> HK<00:01:57.100> which<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.390> sounds<00:01:58.690> for

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
called CD HK which is it sounds for

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
called CD HK which is it sounds for
Canon<00:01:59.200> hack<00:01:59.920> development<00:02:00.790> kit<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:02.740> it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
Canon hack development kit and what it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.650 
Canon hack development kit and what it
does<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.400> install<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.940> on<00:02:04.000> your<00:02:04.240> camera

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
does is you install it on your camera

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.870 
does is you install it on your camera
and<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.500> unlocks<00:02:05.860> loads<00:02:06.190> of<00:02:06.460> other<00:02:06.610> options

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and it unlocks loads of other options

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.999 
and it unlocks loads of other options
that<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.570> use<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:08.379> reason<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.800> haven't

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
that you can use the reason I haven't

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.100 
that you can use the reason I haven't
used<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.640> yet<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.030> because<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.360> quite<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.899> to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
used it yet is because I quite like to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.600 
used it yet is because I quite like to
do<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.530> rest<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> videos<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.489> was

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
do the rest of the videos that I was

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.790 
do the rest of the videos that I was
planning<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.269> with<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.230> settings<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
planning to do with the settings that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.320 
planning to do with the settings that
everyone<00:02:15.250> will<00:02:15.400> get<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.670> camera<00:02:15.970> because

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
everyone will get on the camera because

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.700 
everyone will get on the camera because
not<00:02:16.540> everyone<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> going<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> install<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
not everyone is going to install that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.710 
not everyone is going to install that
and<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> don't<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.190> think<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.580> fair<00:02:18.790> to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
and I don't really think it's fair to

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.840 
and I don't really think it's fair to
so<00:02:19.810> options<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.560> not<00:02:20.710> everyone<00:02:21.100> can<00:02:21.280> use<00:02:21.520> so

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
so options that not everyone can use so

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.550 
so options that not everyone can use so
I<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.270> once<00:02:22.570> I've<00:02:22.780> done<00:02:22.960> everything<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
I think once I've done everything that I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.650 
I think once I've done everything that I
want<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.890> do<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.040> their<00:02:24.430> basic<00:02:24.880> set<00:02:25.090> up<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.420> will

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
want to do on their basic set up I will

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.350 
want to do on their basic set up I will
have<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.350> guy<00:02:26.590> installing<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.400> hack<00:02:27.700> kit

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
have a guy installing that hack kit

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.810 
have a guy installing that hack kit
because<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:29.560> feedback<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.220> really<00:02:30.250> good<00:02:30.700> on

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
because the feedback is really good on

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.280 
because the feedback is really good on
it<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.510> seems<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:31.960> something<00:02:32.230> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
it and it seems like something that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.620 
it and it seems like something that
would<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.890> worthwhile<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:34.150> what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
would be really worthwhile because what

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.360 
would be really worthwhile because what
it<00:02:34.750> would<00:02:34.840> do<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.230> let<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.500> do<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.950> longer

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it would do is it let you do a longer

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.440 
it would do is it let you do a longer
shutter<00:02:37.180> speed<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.730> unlocks<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.300> lot

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
shutter speed and it's a unlocks a lot

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.270 
shutter speed and it's a unlocks a lot
of<00:02:40.540> different<00:02:40.840> things<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.290> I'll<00:02:41.800> let<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.130> know

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
of different things so I'll let you know

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.490 
of different things so I'll let you know
if<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.910> decide<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.390> do<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.690> or<00:02:43.810> won't<00:02:44.170> probably

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
if I decide to do that or won't probably

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.060 
if I decide to do that or won't probably
make<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> video<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.620> I've<00:02:47.620> got<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
make a video on it so I've got it on a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.580 
make a video on it so I've got it on a
ten-second<00:02:48.670> timer<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.300> reason<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.440> it

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
ten-second timer a reason for that it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.050 
ten-second timer a reason for that it
gives<00:02:50.770> me<00:02:50.920> time<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.160> walk<00:02:51.430> away<00:02:51.550> from<00:02:51.880> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
gives me time to walk away from the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.870 
gives me time to walk away from the
camera<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.950> be<00:02:53.950> ready<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.640> start

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
camera and be ready for it to start

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.640 
camera and be ready for it to start
taking<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.360> picture<00:02:55.780> before<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.170> start<00:02:56.500> my

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
taking the picture before I start my

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.670 
taking the picture before I start my
light<00:02:56.890> writing<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.900> there's<00:02:59.140> two<00:02:59.290> ways<00:02:59.320> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
light writing so there's two ways that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.210 
light writing so there's two ways that
you<00:02:59.740> can<00:02:59.830> do<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.310> writing<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:01.360> can<00:03:01.740> write<00:03:02.740> or

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
you can do like writing you can write or

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.180 
you can do like writing you can write or
draw<00:03:03.670> whatever<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.390> want<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.630> write<00:03:04.840> or<00:03:04.990> draw

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
draw whatever you want to write or draw

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.010 
draw whatever you want to write or draw
as<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.400> you're<00:03:06.550> looking<00:03:06.940> at<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.540> write

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
as if you're looking at it so you write

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.560 
as if you're looking at it so you write
the<00:03:08.170> text<00:03:08.530> from<00:03:08.820> left<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.910> right<00:03:10.180> as<00:03:10.420> you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the text from left to right as you

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.150 
the text from left to right as you
normally<00:03:10.930> would<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.350> then<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:11.980> flip

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
normally would and then you can flip

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.420 
normally would and then you can flip
that<00:03:12.550> image<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.950> Photoshop<00:03:14.950> or<00:03:15.130> whatever

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.699 
I'm used to writing their letters
backwards<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.180> do<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.600> wrong<00:03:25.810> occasionally

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
backwards I do get it wrong occasionally

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:35.510 
backwards I do get it wrong occasionally
everyone<00:03:27.130> will

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.460 

so<00:03:36.520> I'm<00:03:36.610> just<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> living<00:03:37.270> room<00:03:37.690> I've<00:03:38.170> I've

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
so I'm just in the living room I've I've

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.050 
so I'm just in the living room I've I've
got<00:03:38.710> big<00:03:38.890> space<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:39.670> if<00:03:39.760> you're<00:03:39.910> too

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
got big space because if you're too

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.970 
got big space because if you're too
close<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.600> camera<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.530> tend<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.890> just

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
close to the camera you tend to just

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.370 
close to the camera you tend to just
sort<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.400> shine<00:03:42.820> too<00:03:43.120> much<00:03:43.390> on<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
sort of shine too much on the on the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.800 
sort of shine too much on the on the
lens<00:03:44.620> not<00:03:45.070> really<00:03:46.060> having<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.480> desired

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
lens not really having the desired

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.850 
lens not really having the desired
effect<00:03:46.900> because<00:03:47.290> you've<00:03:47.470> got<00:03:47.650> light

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
effect because you've got light

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.920 
effect because you've got light
spreading<00:03:48.310> everywhere<00:03:48.730> whereas<00:03:49.600> if<00:03:49.750> you're

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
spreading everywhere whereas if you're

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.540 
spreading everywhere whereas if you're
standing<00:03:50.200> quite<00:03:50.530> far<00:03:50.770> back<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.190> light's<00:03:51.400> not

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
standing quite far back the light's not

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.460 
standing quite far back the light's not
spreading<00:03:52.000> too<00:03:52.240> much<00:03:52.450> further<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.050> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
spreading too much further and the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.960 
spreading too much further and the
camera<00:03:53.770> can<00:03:53.920> focus<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.490> light<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> bit

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
camera can focus on the light a bit

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.570 
camera can focus on the light a bit
easier<00:03:55.330> also<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:57.070> need<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.310> take<00:03:57.460> your

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
easier also you need to take your

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.130 
easier also you need to take your
filters<00:03:57.970> off<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.330> you've<00:03:58.450> got<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> filter<00:03:58.930> on

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
filters off if you've got a filter on

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.390 
filters off if you've got a filter on
your<00:03:59.290> camera<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.560> need<00:03:59.710> to<00:03:59.830> take<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.100> off<00:04:00.220> for

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
your camera you need to take it off for

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.190 
your camera you need to take it off for
this<00:04:00.580> because<00:04:01.090> otherwise<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.660> light<00:04:01.870> shines

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
this because otherwise the light shines

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.050 
this because otherwise the light shines
onto<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.740> filter<00:04:02.980> before<00:04:03.520> it<00:04:03.580> gets<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.970> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
onto the filter before it gets to the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.690 
onto the filter before it gets to the
lens<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.570> kind<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:04.990> get<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.460> filter

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
lens and you kind of get the the filter

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.150 
lens and you kind of get the the filter
then<00:04:07.030> reflects<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.260> lens<00:04:08.470> I'll<00:04:08.800> show<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.040> a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
then reflects the lens I'll show you a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.880 
then reflects the lens I'll show you a
picture<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.730> here

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.950 

I've<00:04:13.190> got<00:04:13.640> my<00:04:13.730> camera<00:04:13.970> set<00:04:14.210> on<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.360> gorilla<00:04:14.690> pod

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
I've got my camera set on a gorilla pod

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.300 
I've got my camera set on a gorilla pod
now<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.290> don't<00:04:15.560> know<00:04:15.650> if<00:04:15.710> you've<00:04:15.890> ever<00:04:15.980> seen

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
now I don't know if you've ever seen

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.910 
now I don't know if you've ever seen
these<00:04:16.840> they<00:04:17.840> basically<00:04:18.140> they<00:04:18.350> have<00:04:18.470> legs<00:04:18.709> that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
these they basically they have legs that

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.520 
these they basically they have legs that
can<00:04:19.100> bend<00:04:19.430> this<00:04:20.000> throughput<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.930> far<00:04:21.320> too

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
can bend this throughput is far too

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.610 
can bend this throughput is far too
light<00:04:21.920> for<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.730> for<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.270> EMS<00:04:23.600> x40<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:24.500> it's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
light for the for the EMS x40 but it's

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.360 
light for the for the EMS x40 but it's
the<00:04:24.680> only<00:04:24.800> one<00:04:24.950> I've<00:04:25.130> got

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
the only one I've got

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.790 
the only one I've got
and<00:04:25.610> all<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.240> really<00:04:26.600> need<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> do<00:04:27.260> is<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and all I really need it to do is to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.860 
and all I really need it to do is to
allow<00:04:28.040> me<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.250> change<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.240> angle<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
allow me to change the angle of the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.560 
allow me to change the angle of the
camera<00:04:30.170> if<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:31.070> need<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.090> just<00:04:32.330> seeing

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
camera if I need to so I'm just seeing

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.460 
camera if I need to so I'm just seeing
it<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.740> TV<00:04:33.980> here<00:04:34.660> I've<00:04:35.660> got<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.020> screen

it on the TV here I've got the screen

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.000 
it on the TV here I've got the screen
flipped<00:04:36.890> out<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.490> means<00:04:38.060> that<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.740> use<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
flipped out it means that I can use the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.340 
flipped out it means that I can use the

controls from this way around I don't

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.230 
controls from this way around I don't

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
have to stand behind the TV to use it

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.370 
have to stand behind the TV to use it
what<00:04:44.540> I'm<00:04:44.630> going<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> do<00:04:44.930> I'm<00:04:45.050> going<00:04:45.169> to<00:04:45.230> have<00:04:45.350> a

small thing to write when you're on a 15
second<00:05:13.250> limit<00:05:13.580> but<00:05:13.820> I'm<00:05:13.970> going<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.150> try<00:05:14.390> my

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
second limit but I'm going to try my

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.040 
second limit but I'm going to try my
best<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:15.169> show<00:05:16.040> you<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.250> result<00:05:16.990> what<00:05:17.990> I'm

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
best and show you the result what I'm

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.210 
best and show you the result what I'm
going<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.200> do<00:05:18.350> I'm<00:05:18.590> going<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.770> press<00:05:19.010> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
going to do I'm going to press the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.190 
going to do I'm going to press the
button<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:19.880> would<00:05:20.000> do<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.150> 10-second<00:05:20.840> countdown

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
button it would do a 10-second countdown

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.350 
button it would do a 10-second countdown
on<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.650> timer<00:05:21.919> in<00:05:22.280> which<00:05:22.760> time<00:05:23.000> I'm<00:05:23.150> going<00:05:23.270> to

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
on the timer in which time I'm going to

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000 
on the timer in which time I'm going to
turn<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.720> camera<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.200> switch<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.800> light<00:05:24.979> off

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
turn the camera and switch the light off

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.000 
turn the camera and switch the light off
so<00:05:25.220> let's<00:05:25.700> hope<00:05:25.910> that<00:05:26.090> ia<00:05:26.440> move<00:05:27.440> fast<00:05:27.770> enough

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
so let's hope that ia move fast enough

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.280 
so let's hope that ia move fast enough
so<00:05:29.000> I'm<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.479> going<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.660> make<00:05:29.840> sure<00:05:29.960> that<00:05:30.140> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
so I'm just going to make sure that the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.880 
so I'm just going to make sure that the
timer<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.740> set<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:33.020> I've<00:05:33.110> just<00:05:33.169> set<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.650> self

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
timer is set so I've just set the self

00:05:33.890 --> 00:06:04.650 
timer is set so I've just set the self
time<00:05:34.100> into<00:05:34.370> 10<00:05:34.610> seconds<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.840> if<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.169> go

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.840 

so<00:06:05.290> hopefully<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:05.800> could<00:06:05.950> see<00:06:06.220> that<00:06:06.460> being

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
so hopefully you could see that being

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.790 
so hopefully you could see that being
written<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.600> don't<00:06:08.320> know<00:06:08.380> how<00:06:08.470> it's<00:06:08.620> going<00:06:08.710> to

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
written I don't know how it's going to

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.890 
written I don't know how it's going to
come<00:06:08.890> out<00:06:09.010> yet<00:06:09.220> I<00:06:09.430> think<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.480> did<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.660> end

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
come out yet I think I did the end

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.620 
come out yet I think I did the end
backwards<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.940> it<00:06:13.000> takes<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.300> little<00:06:13.420> while<00:06:13.570> to

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
backwards so it takes a little while to

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.660 
backwards so it takes a little while to
process<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.410> if<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.590> just<00:06:14.830> play<00:06:15.070> back<00:06:15.400> the

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
process it if I just play back the

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:23.840 
process it if I just play back the
result

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.920 

so<00:06:24.850> you<00:06:24.910> can<00:06:25.030> see<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:25.270> image<00:06:25.480> here<00:06:25.660> I<00:06:25.690> went<00:06:25.870> a

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
so you can see the image here I went a

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.260 
so you can see the image here I went a
little<00:06:25.960> bit<00:06:26.260> of<00:06:26.380> off-center<00:06:27.160> it's<00:06:27.940> not<00:06:28.150> as

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
little bit of off-center it's not as

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.060 
little bit of off-center it's not as
blue<00:06:28.510> as<00:06:28.660> it<00:06:28.810> looks<00:06:29.020> on<00:06:29.200> this<00:06:29.350> camera<00:06:29.740> I'll<00:06:29.860> put

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
blue as it looks on this camera I'll put

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.970 
blue as it looks on this camera I'll put
the<00:06:30.220> image<00:06:30.670> on<00:06:30.820> here<00:06:31.090> so<00:06:31.810> obviously<00:06:32.740> where<00:06:32.890> I'm

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
the image on here so obviously where I'm

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.680 
the image on here so obviously where I'm
using<00:06:33.190> a<00:06:33.370> light<00:06:33.610> that's<00:06:33.820> quite<00:06:34.120> bright<00:06:34.360> it's

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
using a light that's quite bright it's

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.150 
using a light that's quite bright it's
starting<00:06:35.050> to<00:06:35.200> light<00:06:35.350> up<00:06:35.590> the<00:06:35.710> room<00:06:35.890> so<00:06:35.920> you

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
starting to light up the room so you

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.250 
starting to light up the room so you
will<00:06:36.430> see<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.820> room<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.630> have<00:06:37.840> to<00:06:37.990> be<00:06:38.080> in<00:06:38.170> a

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
will see the room you have to be in a

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.760 
will see the room you have to be in a
pretty<00:06:38.470> featureless<00:06:39.280> room<00:06:39.610> in<00:06:40.450> order<00:06:40.900> to<00:06:41.170> do

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
pretty featureless room in order to do

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.170 
pretty featureless room in order to do
this<00:06:41.920> without<00:06:42.160> seeing<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.640> rest<00:06:42.790> of<00:06:42.880> the<00:06:42.970> room

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
this without seeing the rest of the room

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.930 
this without seeing the rest of the room
but<00:06:43.390> quite<00:06:43.720> often<00:06:44.200> people<00:06:44.920> like<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.550> have<00:06:45.700> that

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
but quite often people like to have that

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.760 
but quite often people like to have that
sort<00:06:46.720> of<00:06:46.780> image<00:06:47.020> I'm<00:06:47.170> going<00:06:47.230> to<00:06:47.380> try<00:06:47.560> and<00:06:47.680> do<00:06:47.740> a

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
sort of image I'm going to try and do a

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.770 
sort of image I'm going to try and do a
better<00:06:48.690> version<00:06:49.690> of<00:06:49.960> this<00:06:50.230> so<00:06:50.740> you<00:06:50.800> can<00:06:51.070> see<00:06:51.280> it

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
better version of this so you can see it

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.900 
better version of this so you can see it
in<00:06:52.780> its<00:06:52.960> glory<00:06:53.230> and<00:06:53.560> then<00:06:54.010> I'll<00:06:54.160> do<00:06:54.550> a<00:06:54.580> couple

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
in its glory and then I'll do a couple

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.940 
in its glory and then I'll do a couple
of<00:06:54.970> other<00:06:55.090> images<00:06:56.020> so<00:06:56.170> you<00:06:56.230> can<00:06:56.440> see<00:06:56.620> the<00:06:56.710> sort

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
of other images so you can see the sort

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.040 
of other images so you can see the sort
of<00:06:57.010> thing<00:06:57.100> that<00:06:57.220> like<00:06:57.400> writing<00:06:57.790> can<00:06:58.000> do<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.570> as

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
of thing that like writing can do and as

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.550 
of thing that like writing can do and as
I<00:06:59.200> said<00:06:59.260> I<00:06:59.470> would<00:06:59.860> like<00:07:00.040> to<00:07:00.220> try<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:00.490> the<00:07:01.210> hack

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
I said I would like to try the the hack

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.710 
I said I would like to try the the hack
Canon<00:07:02.560> hack<00:07:02.740> development<00:07:03.310> kit<00:07:03.580> so<00:07:04.240> that<00:07:04.270> I<00:07:04.420> can

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
Canon hack development kit so that I can

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.210 
Canon hack development kit so that I can
do<00:07:04.900> it<00:07:04.960> with<00:07:05.050> a<00:07:05.080> longer<00:07:05.320> shutter<00:07:05.560> speed<00:07:05.950> but<00:07:05.980> at

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
do it with a longer shutter speed but at

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.680 
do it with a longer shutter speed but at
the<00:07:06.340> moment<00:07:06.520> I<00:07:06.850> think<00:07:06.940> it's<00:07:07.240> important<00:07:07.660> that

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
the moment I think it's important that

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.870 
the moment I think it's important that
people<00:07:07.810> can<00:07:08.740> learn<00:07:08.860> how<00:07:09.040> to<00:07:09.070> do<00:07:09.340> these<00:07:09.550> things

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
people can learn how to do these things

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.000 
people can learn how to do these things
without<00:07:10.170> having<00:07:11.170> all<00:07:11.260> these<00:07:11.380> extra<00:07:11.800> features

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
without having all these extra features

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.550 
without having all these extra features
that<00:07:12.220> they<00:07:12.460> may<00:07:12.670> not<00:07:12.820> have<00:07:12.880> access<00:07:13.150> to<00:07:13.560> so

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
that they may not have access to so

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.230 
that they may not have access to so
that's<00:07:14.860> hard<00:07:15.070> to<00:07:15.190> do<00:07:15.310> light<00:07:15.490> writing<00:07:15.730> is<00:07:15.970> it's

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
that's hard to do light writing is it's

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.080 
that's hard to do light writing is it's
great<00:07:16.540> fun<00:07:16.950> the<00:07:17.950> exciting<00:07:18.670> thing<00:07:18.850> is<00:07:18.970> you

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
great fun the exciting thing is you

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.320 
great fun the exciting thing is you
don't<00:07:19.300> know<00:07:19.420> the<00:07:19.570> result<00:07:19.900> until<00:07:20.490> that<00:07:21.490> picture

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
don't know the result until that picture

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.450 
don't know the result until that picture
previews<00:07:22.780> back<00:07:22.990> so<00:07:23.380> I<00:07:23.710> hope<00:07:23.920> you<00:07:24.070> guys<00:07:24.250> have
