00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.260
 do not 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello very good everyone vibrates this 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.340
 gameplay of rising 3 in which I will teach 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.170
 how is the megaman suit in this 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.510
 new delivery and also how does it work 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 corresponding xv you and also 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 I will teach which is the best vehicle 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.000
 Fukushima the devourer so good 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.869
 we are nor are we staying in the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.759
 lost and good first thing is we close 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.280
 the shelters to come to equate us 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.570
 with said suit and weapons for those who do not 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.700
 know 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.390
 good the weapon and the suit first that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.370
 unlock it to unlock the suit 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 you need to complete the game let's say the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.400
 Normal mode of the game get the end 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 that is the best ending let's say and 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.600
 completing the entire half of the game if 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 you will reach the end that and the weapon will 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.769
 get to get to the end that but 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.210
 in nightmare mode 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.850
 so we have the weapon here in the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 weapons closet in the weapons section 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 of fire you have here 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.670
 x booster we can take all those that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 we want to fill the inventory is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.509
 say that at level 50 when we have 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.030
 the maximum skill each weapon has 200 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.830
 ammunition bullets and good you can come 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 to put everything you want here in the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 clothes closet we have the suit 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.920
 megaman x that I personally thought 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.300
 the best mega man in history 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.210
 really see if one day I'll do it again 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.360
 one like that and well here you have then 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 that is already the whole set with his 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 recognized the recognized sound of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 footprints that produces here I'm going to leave 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.870
 for you to see it is a little bit 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.490
 as the costume itself is to say that no 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.130
 is undoubtedly the best of the three 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.280
 deliveries in both design and 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.350
 power goes on everything is definitely better and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 well I'll show a little for that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.510
 the types of attacks you have 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.070
 here you have let's say the basic shot 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.450
 for those who do not know 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.580
 the moment of megamall history 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280
 this shooting team was called the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.800
 solar let's say you have those three types 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.750
 of power worth this would be the lowest 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.030
 of all here there is no second level in 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.680
 this game the games beat him if he 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 that yes you have this game is the most 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.120
 what destructive level 3 are you going to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.840
 check now simply by pressing 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.690
 the button and already I would use it and good 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.150
 here it is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.640
 as you see that explosion without a doubt the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.630
 convert 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.560
 in the most destructive weapon in the game 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.569
 that is to say, as you see, very attractive 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.400
 we got to the vans yes the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.890
 arrives to return others arrives destroy 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 as you have purchased now the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.180
 vehicles that are let's say bigger 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 with trucks or trucks the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 ideal junk 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.400
 where the work of cement and other does not 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.879
 can move 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:59.099
 and generates until superior and almost 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.930
 also small but very little but yes 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.389
 that tdt comes to you that knockout of 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.860
 throw yourself to the public good as said 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:10.460
 before there are 200 bullets for each arm 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.960
 but with its destructive power it's like 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.220
 writing right now is to say that 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.090
 during the game if you use the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.190
 psychopaths also die of very few 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.740
 shooting but of course you have to take 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.850
 notice that this suit is already unlocked 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.940
 a stage of the game and it would be for him more 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.160
 well a wink a low power because in 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.300
 have it complete or someone you want 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.850
 become a third mind 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.740
 and let's say the game to get a little 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.510
 of profit or simply to raise the 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.460
 last levels or you can even 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.930
 finish everything with games it is possible that 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.360
 greater than level 50 but well then nothing 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.920
 from here but to continue killing a 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.600
 little bit so you can see the best 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.340
 method to get game points 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.350
 very to vigo is this that you are seeing in 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.470
 screen you can put that you're going 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.700
 through the streets of the city they are killing 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.390
 to zombies and while you have the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.340
 combo counter rangel or point that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.650
 As you can see in the bar above, they go up to 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.450
 a speed we go incredible also 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.660
 warned that in the channel you will find the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.280
 step by step guide of that new nightmare 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.350
 It's like complicating the nightmare game 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.510
 with all sessions with turn 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.270
 rescued survivor like to take down 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.770
 all 5 parasites and well well 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.570
 if someone wants to see it in case someone 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.870
 have any questions or if someone has 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.510
 an achievement and how it is achieved in others 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.330
 videos in concrete is not worth for things of the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.940
 hospital because the principal the most 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.380
 I had thought better to do was to almost 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.200
 all the dishes could create all the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.320
 weapons and those things are trans indicates the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.850
 own game so I'm not going to do it and 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.430
 well here we have as I said to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.410
 principle the devourer the one who is without 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.260
 no doubt the best vehicle of the game 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.260
 you get let's say the plane or the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.150
 design is achieved in the first 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.370
 chapters of the game 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.670
 I will not say where but it is impossible 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.320
 losing the impossible not getting it and 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:10.310
 good as you see 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.720
 fast is super destructive and has 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.100
 also a secondary mode that I'll use 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.480
 Now that I'm waiting a little bit 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.920
 have a large group of zombies 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.260
 in a secondary attack with which 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.000
 let's say you can soften up there I am 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.350
 watching it softened in a little 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.760
 zombies as startup grabs a 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.180
 little bit of life since being run over 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:33.210
 so it would increase much more 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.750
 sports this method would be the course 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.819
 the best to achieve is the achievement of 104 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.680
 thousand dead but as you can see the points 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.990
 they are very few that something compensates 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.680
 the other part the point is the mega wrong 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.259
 and to kill this this vehicle so 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.370
 Nothing looks here, we are in another area 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.620
 of the city 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.380
 but good, I came to say goodbye 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.820
 all of you reflectors in this 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.880
 rocket store 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.140
 then it goes through them and they throw all 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.750
 your brains will see these fires 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.720
 artificial and good with it I say goodbye 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.160
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.650

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.870
 see megan al and of course I invite you 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.330
 to see that videoguías you will find inside 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.570
 of little here in the channel a greeting and we 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.570
 we see
