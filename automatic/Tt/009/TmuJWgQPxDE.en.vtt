00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.930
 hello welcome to my channel today we are going to 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.810
 make jelly with cream will 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.580
 use four gelatins of different 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.779
 flavors and color 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's use a measuring cup to a 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.120
 milkmaid and a half cream 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.719
 what are we going to do in our cup 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.719
 measurer 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.240
 is that we are going to die 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.880
 800 milliliters 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.909
 let's put the 900 what we want 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 is that our gelatin 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.500
 I was a little harder 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.580
 then it is the liter are 900 milliliters 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.380
 of water we are going to let it boil and go 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.980
 to start preparing all our 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.980
 jellies 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.100
 good for our jellies we are going to 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:44.740
 use 4 long refractories 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.740
 and we are going to add a few drops of oil 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.360
 with a napkin 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 we started putting it in all our 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.320
 refractory 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.930
 this is so that our gelatin does not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 hit us and it's going to be easier 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.090
 take out the jelly pieces 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.480
 we will do this procedure 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 with all the reflectors 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.300
 Well, the water is already boiling 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.300
 we go 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.620
 and let's add that as well as manager 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.190
 we are going to undo it very well from below 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.610
 because when they cool down all 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 the ones that buildings us goes to the bottom and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.769
 it is very hard 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.550
 the truth is unpleasant when I already 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.270
 we're 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.550
 so 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.550
 blood is all very well out 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.580
 If you have any questions, you can do it 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.580
 they leave it and as soon as I see it 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.550
 and it is very yielding 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.670
 and so we're going to do away with all the 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.580
 jellies and we're going to put them in 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.200
 refrigerator and when they're ready 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.200
 we start with the preparation 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.340
 good what we are going to do with the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.340
 Jellies is to start cutting 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.189
 the squares are many points at stake 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:57.119
 and then with the help of a ladle the 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.119
 we started to drop 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.140
 ah 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.869
 and fame when in a refractory 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:21.869
 big 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.270
 We are going to do this with all the 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.139
 latinas 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.629
 Y 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.629
 well let's add in our creams 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.620
 ah 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.680
 and now we are going to add 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.850
 the can 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.850
 of condensed milk 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.840
 two 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.840
 and so much 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.159
 ah 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.680
 good so the legend to gelatin 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.229
 with cream 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.660
 you know if they liked a little finger up 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.660
