and possibly a little bit sick of how
the<00:02:16.310> government's<00:02:16.880> intervened<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.630> how<00:02:17.780> that

biggest piece of advice that I would

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.350 
biggest piece of advice that I would

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
with life is to try and find what it is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.370

they need to start to accept themselves

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.160 
they need to start to accept themselves
and<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.100> love<00:02:34.130> themselves<00:02:34.489> because<00:02:35.180> that's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and to love themselves because that's

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.860 
and to love themselves because that's
where<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.470> think<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.829> all<00:02:36.950> starts<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.910> if<00:02:38.600> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
where I think it all starts and if you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.850 
where I think it all starts and if you
can<00:02:39.160> make<00:02:40.160> efforts<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:41.620> understand<00:02:42.620> your<00:02:42.829> own

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
can make efforts to understand your own

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.000 
can make efforts to understand your own
self-worth<00:02:43.660> which<00:02:44.660> we<00:02:44.810> all<00:02:44.989> have<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.470> all<00:02:45.500> have

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
self-worth which we all have we all have

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.860 
self-worth which we all have we all have
a<00:02:46.040> hundred<00:02:46.459> percent<00:02:46.549> self-worth<00:02:47.239> sometimes

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
a hundred percent self-worth sometimes

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.890 
a hundred percent self-worth sometimes
it's<00:02:48.079> just<00:02:48.140> difficult<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.799> see<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:50.720> you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
it's just difficult to see that if you

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.229 
it's just difficult to see that if you
can<00:02:51.079> start<00:02:51.380> from<00:02:51.620> there<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.280> learn<00:02:52.880> how<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
can start from there and learn how to

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.270 
can start from there and learn how to
love<00:02:53.570> yourself<00:02:53.720> then<00:02:54.620> everything<00:02:54.890> else<00:02:55.130> will

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
love yourself then everything else will

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.449 
love yourself then everything else will
fall<00:02:55.519> into<00:02:55.730> place<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.980> as<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> young

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
fall into place I think as a young

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.449 
fall into place I think as a young
person<00:02:58.489> if<00:02:59.269> you've<00:02:59.690> if<00:03:00.140> you're<00:03:00.680> committing

person if you've if you're committing
yourself<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.750> best<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.440> be

yourself to be the best that you can be

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.330 
yourself to be the best that you can be
then<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.450> should<00:03:05.660> never<00:03:05.989> ever<00:03:06.350> listen<00:03:07.130> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
then you should never ever listen to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.610 
then you should never ever listen to
anything<00:03:07.459> that<00:03:08.180> anybody<00:03:08.540> else<00:03:08.930> says<00:03:09.200> don't

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
anything that anybody else says don't

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.550 
anything that anybody else says don't

people are whether wrong and they're

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.750 
people are whether wrong and they're
from<00:03:18.050> Victoria<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.860> they<00:03:19.070> walked<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:19.520> land

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
from Victoria and they walked this land

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.880 
from Victoria and they walked this land
long<00:03:20.120> before<00:03:20.480> anybody<00:03:20.870> else<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.380> did<00:03:21.590> and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
long before anybody else here did and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.520 
long before anybody else here did and
for<00:03:22.160> me<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:23.330> gives<00:03:23.600> me<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.900> sense<00:03:24.230> of

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
for me that gives me a sense of

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.490 
for me that gives me a sense of
connection<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.910> think<00:03:26.420> White<00:03:27.290> Australia

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
connection that I think White Australia

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.200 
connection that I think White Australia
is<00:03:28.870> unfortunate<00:03:29.870> not<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.160> from<00:03:31.910> that

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
is unfortunate not to have and from that

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.020 
is unfortunate not to have and from that
basis<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:33.080> would<00:03:33.620> say<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.160> when<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.580> go<00:03:34.850> out

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
basis I would say that when you go out

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.130 
basis I would say that when you go out
into<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.360> world<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:38.000> need<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.480> feel

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.860 
into the world you just need to feel
good<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.920> proud<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.400> strong<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.420> yourself

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
good and proud and strong in yourself

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
and in your skin and know that you have

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.690

a hundred percent worth and so much to

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.360 
a hundred percent worth and so much to
offer<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.270> when<00:03:48.230> mum<00:03:48.470> always<00:03:48.710> is<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.040> say

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
offer and when mum always is to say

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.610 
offer and when mum always is to say
there's<00:03:49.700> always<00:03:50.330> somebody<00:03:50.660> out<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.470> world

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
there's always somebody out in the world

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.310 
there's always somebody out in the world
looking<00:03:52.460> for<00:03:52.730> exactly<00:03:53.090> what<00:03:53.510> you've<00:03:53.780> got<00:03:54.110> and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
looking for exactly what you've got and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.010 
looking for exactly what you've got and
that<00:03:54.410> applies<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.280> everyone<00:03:55.820> and<00:03:56.210> I<00:03:56.480> think

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
that applies to everyone and I think

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.500 
that applies to everyone and I think
that's<00:03:57.470> what<00:03:57.770> generation<00:03:58.250> one<00:03:58.610> is<00:03:58.970> all<00:03:59.150> about
