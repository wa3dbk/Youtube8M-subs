against<00:00:11.690> Adrian<00:00:12.170> Peterson<00:00:12.559> kind<00:00:13.040> of<00:00:13.099> an

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
against Adrian Peterson kind of an

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.560 
against Adrian Peterson kind of an
interesting<00:00:13.370> matchup<00:00:13.790> two<00:00:14.120> totally

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
interesting matchup two totally

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.940 
interesting matchup two totally
different<00:00:14.750> positions<00:00:15.259> and<00:00:15.380> ways<00:00:15.589> of<00:00:15.740> thinking

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
different positions and ways of thinking

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.400 
different positions and ways of thinking
I'm<00:00:16.580> going<00:00:16.820> with<00:00:16.939> Adrian<00:00:17.300> Peterson<00:00:17.720> here<00:00:17.960> he's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
I'm going with Adrian Peterson here he's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.109 
I'm going with Adrian Peterson here he's
probably<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.040> best<00:00:19.189> all-around<00:00:19.489> back<00:00:19.849> in<00:00:20.029> the

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
probably the best all-around back in the

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.819 
probably the best all-around back in the
league<00:00:20.300> we've<00:00:20.540> seen<00:00:20.720> him<00:00:20.840> dominate<00:00:21.169> at<00:00:21.560> times

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:21.829 
league we've seen him dominate at times

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.429 
league we've seen him dominate at times
and<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.579> just<00:00:22.759> think<00:00:22.939> positionally<00:00:23.599> a<00:00:23.750> running

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
and I just think positionally a running

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.139 
and I just think positionally a running
back<00:00:24.590> is<00:00:24.770> such<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.070> game<00:00:25.430> breaker<00:00:25.700> and<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:26.000> make

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:26.149 
back is such a game breaker and can make

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.729 
back is such a game breaker and can make
such<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.419> difference<00:00:26.509> on<00:00:26.869> any<00:00:27.140> given<00:00:27.380> play

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
such a difference on any given play

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.190 
such a difference on any given play
that's<00:00:28.250> my<00:00:28.399> guy<00:00:28.579> I<00:00:28.849> would<00:00:29.630> rather<00:00:29.840> have<00:00:30.169> a

that's my guy I would rather have a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.109 
that's my guy I would rather have a
defensive<00:00:30.860> tackle<00:00:31.279> who<00:00:31.430> is<00:00:31.610> completely

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
defensive tackle who is completely

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.980 
Peterson yeah he may have played four
years<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.610> what's<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.329> lifespan<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.840> a

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
years but what's the lifespan of a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.080 
years but what's the lifespan of a
running<00:00:51.260> back<00:00:51.410> these<00:00:51.620> three<00:00:51.800> years<00:00:52.460> but<00:00:52.970> how

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
running back these three years but how

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.420 
running back these three years but how
many<00:00:53.150> impact<00:00:53.660> plays<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.560> defensive<00:00:55.040> tackle

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
many impact plays is a defensive tackle

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.830 
many impact plays is a defensive tackle
going<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.610> have<00:00:55.760> during<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.120> game<00:00:56.300> versus<00:00:56.810> a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
going to have during a game versus a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.660 
going to have during a game versus a
running<00:00:57.170> back<00:00:57.320> when<00:00:57.500> they<00:00:57.590> touch<00:00:57.770> it<00:00:57.950> 30<00:00:58.310> times

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
running back when they touch it 30 times

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.370 
running back when they touch it 30 times
the<00:00:58.820> game<00:00:58.970> and<00:00:59.149> Peterson<00:00:59.810> yet<00:00:59.989> he's<00:01:00.200> been

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
the game and Peterson yet he's been

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.440 
the game and Peterson yet he's been
dinged<00:01:00.620> up<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:00.980> times<00:01:01.220> he's<00:01:01.730> only<00:01:01.880> played<00:01:02.180> four

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
dinged up at times he's only played four

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.580 
dinged up at times he's only played four
years<00:01:02.480> it<00:01:02.810> seems<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.110> he's<00:01:03.230> been<00:01:03.260> around

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
years it seems like he's been around

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.020 
years it seems like he's been around
forever<00:01:03.890> he<00:01:04.250> never<00:01:04.430> led<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.850> league<00:01:04.970> in

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
forever he never led the league in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030 
forever he never led the league in
caries<00:01:05.540> or<00:01:05.659> anything<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.110> when<00:01:06.890> he

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
caries or anything like that when he

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.649 
caries or anything like that when he
does<00:01:07.280> play<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:07.880> think<00:01:08.120> now<00:01:08.300> that<00:01:08.360> he

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
does play and I think now that he

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.180 
does play and I think now that he
doesn't<00:01:09.110> have<00:01:09.290> Brett<00:01:09.620> Favre<00:01:09.860> kind<00:01:10.100> of

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
doesn't have Brett Favre kind of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.860 
doesn't have Brett Favre kind of
stealing<00:01:10.580> plays<00:01:10.760> from<00:01:11.030> him<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.360> think<00:01:11.780> he's

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
stealing plays from him I think he's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.330 
stealing plays from him I think he's
gonna<00:01:11.990> play<00:01:12.260> well<00:01:12.440> at<00:01:12.620> work<00:01:12.830> he<00:01:13.040> played<00:01:13.220> his

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
gonna play well at work he played his

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.770 
gonna play well at work he played his
best<00:01:13.520> years<00:01:13.790> with<00:01:13.940> Gus<00:01:14.150> for<00:01:14.390> rot<00:01:14.570> at

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
best years with Gus for rot at

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.940 
best years with Gus for rot at
quarterback<00:01:15.080> yeah<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:15.710> he's<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
quarterback yeah but I think he's a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.440 
quarterback yeah but I think he's a
one-dimensional<00:01:16.700> player<00:01:16.820> very<00:01:17.180> good

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450
