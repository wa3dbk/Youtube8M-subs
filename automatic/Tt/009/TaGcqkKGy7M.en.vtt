we'll do another shot out here at night
with<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:48.700> recording<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.870> night

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
with the recording of just the night

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.940 
with the recording of just the night
vision<00:02:51.410> part<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.870> does<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> zoom<00:02:54.620> feature

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
vision part it does have a zoom feature

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.400 
vision part it does have a zoom feature
on<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.490> I<00:02:55.670> did<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.420> did<00:02:56.600> notice<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.200> zoom

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
on it I did I did notice that the zoom

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.100 
on it I did I did notice that the zoom
feature<00:02:58.810> will<00:02:59.810> makes<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.620> pix<00:03:00.830> elated<00:03:02.110> when

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
feature will makes it pix elated when

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.610 
feature will makes it pix elated when
you<00:03:03.230> try<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.530> zoom<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.870> at<00:03:05.990> night<00:03:06.170> vision<00:03:06.200> you

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
you try the zoom you at night vision you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.550 
you try the zoom you at night vision you
just<00:03:06.800> cannot<00:03:07.400> use<00:03:08.240> that<00:03:08.450> at<00:03:08.600> all<00:03:08.720> because<00:03:09.350> it's

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
just cannot use that at all because it's

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.130 
just cannot use that at all because it's
just<00:03:09.620> way<00:03:09.860> too<00:03:09.920> pixelated<00:03:10.720> night<00:03:11.720> vision<00:03:12.050> I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
just way too pixelated night vision I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.000 
just way too pixelated night vision I
would<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.530> recommend<00:03:12.650> doing<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.340> standard

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
would just recommend doing the standard

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.390 
would just recommend doing the standard
all<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.430> way<00:03:16.520> zoomed<00:03:16.790> out<00:03:16.970> version<00:03:18.400> okay

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
all the way zoomed out version okay

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.430 
all the way zoomed out version okay
that's<00:03:19.820> just<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:20.090> shot<00:03:20.300> showing<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.200> what<00:03:21.350> it

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
that's just a shot showing you what it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.930 
that's just a shot showing you what it
looks<00:03:21.470> like

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.040 

during<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.750> regular<00:03:28.110> vision<00:03:28.950> here<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.460> right

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
during the regular vision here all right

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.090 
during the regular vision here all right
test<00:03:31.050> over<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.070> here<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:33.530> video<00:03:34.530> with<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
test over here so here is video with the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.860 
test over here so here is video with the
LED<00:03:35.820> are<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.630> infrared<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.390> stock<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
LED are the infrared on the stock of the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.290 
LED are the infrared on the stock of the
camera<00:03:40.320> right<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:40.550> hip<00:03:41.550> just<00:03:41.790> somethings

clothes out there and you can see it's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
clothes out there and you can see it's
got<00:03:45.210> pretty<00:03:45.570> good<00:03:45.920> night<00:03:46.920> vision<00:03:48.350> thanks<00:03:49.350> from

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
got pretty good night vision thanks from

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:59.080 
got pretty good night vision thanks from
afar<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.980> kind<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.580> hard<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.910> see<00:03:54.270> right<00:03:58.040> here

whoa look at that that blasted it out so
having<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.630> extra<00:04:16.049> IR<00:04:16.890> light<00:04:18.739> really

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
having that extra IR light really

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.130 
having that extra IR light really
brightens<00:04:21.269> things<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:24.650> ok<00:04:25.650> there's<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:27.140> extra

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
brightens things up ok there's the extra

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.930 
brightens things up ok there's the extra
IR<00:04:28.470> light<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:29.990> now<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.169> off<00:04:31.490> can<00:04:32.490> hardly<00:04:32.580> see

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
IR light on now it's off can hardly see

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.159 
IR light on now it's off can hardly see
that<00:04:33.120> tree

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
that tree

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.980 
that tree
turn<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.039> extra<00:04:36.279> ir<00:04:36.550> light<00:04:36.699> on<00:04:36.879> on<00:04:37.029> and<00:04:37.330> Wow

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
turn the extra ir light on on and Wow

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.920 
turn the extra ir light on on and Wow
comes<00:04:38.800> up<00:04:39.240> nice<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.270> bright<00:04:42.479> see<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.599> corner

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
comes up nice and bright see the corner

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.269 
comes up nice and bright see the corner
of<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.080> yard<00:04:44.199> there<00:04:44.469> with<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.740> extra<00:04:45.009> ir

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
of the yard there with the extra ir

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.869 
of the yard there with the extra ir
light<00:04:45.550> on<00:04:45.870> take<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.900> off<00:04:47.460> really<00:04:48.460> can't<00:04:48.669> see

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
light on take it off really can't see

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.959 
light on take it off really can't see
much<00:04:49.029> in<00:04:49.090> there<00:04:49.539> so<00:04:50.529> the<00:04:50.949> verdict<00:04:51.279> is<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.759> that

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
much in there so the verdict is is that

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.390 
much in there so the verdict is is that
you<00:04:52.719> know<00:04:52.810> just<00:04:53.740> doc<00:04:55.830> infrared<00:04:56.830> light<00:04:57.069> will<00:04:57.249> do

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
you know just doc infrared light will do

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.909 
you know just doc infrared light will do
good<00:04:57.759> for<00:04:57.789> up<00:04:58.180> close<00:04:58.210> stuff<00:04:58.900> but<00:04:59.560> if<00:04:59.650> you<00:04:59.740> want

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
good for up close stuff but if you want

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.730 
good for up close stuff but if you want
to<00:04:59.979> get<00:05:00.039> any<00:05:00.189> kind<00:05:00.460> of<00:05:00.520> distance<00:05:01.650> having<00:05:02.650> this

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to get any kind of distance having this

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.999 
to get any kind of distance having this
additional<00:05:03.900> ir<00:05:06.300> light<00:05:07.300> boom<00:05:08.139> just<00:05:08.589> lights<00:05:08.830> up

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
additional ir light boom just lights up

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:16.900 
additional ir light boom just lights up
the<00:05:09.159> whole<00:05:09.810> area

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.520 

really<00:05:17.630> bright<00:05:19.480> now<00:05:20.480> let's<00:05:20.630> try<00:05:20.840> this<00:05:20.900> i<00:05:21.320> tri

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
really bright now let's try this i tri

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.050 
really bright now let's try this i tri
pointe<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:21.980> up<00:05:22.100> at<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:23.000> moon<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:25.490> can<00:05:25.670> see<00:05:25.910> the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
pointe it up at the moon you can see the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.720 
pointe it up at the moon you can see the
moon<00:05:26.740> jupiter<00:05:27.740> right<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:28.690> okay<00:05:29.690> here's<00:05:30.260> a
