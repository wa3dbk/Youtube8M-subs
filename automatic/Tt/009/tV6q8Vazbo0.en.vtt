00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
characters of the story will be the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
has offspring as well who knows I think

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.520 
has offspring as well who knows I think
that's<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.110> need<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.440> because

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's the way they need to go because

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.270 
that's the way they need to go because
what<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.860> tells<00:02:11.099> me<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.580> there

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
what this tells me is if there

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920 
what this tells me is if there
already<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.730> script<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.330> then<00:02:13.600> they<00:02:13.720> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
already in the script and then they can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.290 
already in the script and then they can
be<00:02:13.959> written<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:15.550> tells<00:02:15.850> me<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
be written out that tells me that the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.630 
be written out that tells me that the
role<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.600> Han<00:02:17.050> Leia<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.470> Luke<00:02:17.530> isn't<00:02:17.920> huge<00:02:18.370> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
role of Han Leia and Luke isn't huge and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.340 
role of Han Leia and Luke isn't huge and
that's<00:02:19.240> good<00:02:19.540> news<00:02:19.720> because<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.050> don't<00:02:20.200> think

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
that's good news because I don't think

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.840 
that's good news because I don't think
this<00:02:20.530> movie<00:02:20.800> needs<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.040> be<00:02:21.130> about<00:02:21.370> them<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
this movie needs to be about them I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.430 
this movie needs to be about them I
think<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.630> continuation<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
think we have the continuation of the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.010 
think we have the continuation of the
story<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.800> Star<00:02:24.010> Wars<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.630> time
