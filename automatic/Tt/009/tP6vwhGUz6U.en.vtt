00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
thing we do I usually like to come in

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.640 
thing we do I usually like to come in
and<00:00:45.339> mow<00:00:45.430> it<00:00:45.610> my<00:00:46.570> thoughts<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:47.110> you<00:00:47.320> know<00:00:47.440> get

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
and mow it my thoughts is you know get

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.229 
and mow it my thoughts is you know get
as<00:00:47.710> much<00:00:47.890> grass<00:00:48.220> out<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.910> there<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.210> know

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
as much grass out of there you know

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.729 
as much grass out of there you know
guess<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.870> don't<00:00:49.930> want<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.199> start<00:00:50.350> off<00:00:50.500> with

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
guess you don't want to start off with

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.280 
guess you don't want to start off with
it<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:52.300> mowing<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.690> for<00:00:52.809> two<00:00:52.930> days<00:00:53.110> and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
it not mowing it for two days and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.689 
it not mowing it for two days and
something<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.650> we<00:00:53.739> always<00:00:53.890> know<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.220> first<00:00:54.460> and

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
something so we always know it first and

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.130 
something so we always know it first and
then<00:00:54.790> we<00:00:54.909> mark<00:00:55.180> our<00:00:55.269> irrigation<00:00:55.449> heads<00:00:55.930> and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
then we mark our irrigation heads and

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.920 
then we mark our irrigation heads and
then<00:00:56.289> just<00:00:57.280> start<00:00:57.489> verdict<00:00:57.789> Cody<00:00:57.969> will

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
then just start verdict Cody will

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.619 
then just start verdict Cody will
vertical<00:00:59.350> one<00:00:59.530> direction<00:01:00.300> pretty<00:01:01.300> much<00:01:01.449> will

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
vertical one direction pretty much will

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.599 
vertical one direction pretty much will
usually<00:01:01.809> drag<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.530> clippings<00:01:03.190> just<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.430> knock

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
usually drag the clippings just a knock

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.630 
usually drag the clippings just a knock
off<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.940> sand<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.680> any<00:01:05.680> excess<00:01:06.130> debris<00:01:06.340> so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
off the sand and any excess debris so

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.130 
off the sand and any excess debris so
we're<00:01:06.759> not<00:01:06.820> picking<00:01:07.060> all<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.450> stuff<00:01:07.690> up<00:01:07.930> and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
we're not picking all that stuff up and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.510 
we're not picking all that stuff up and
then<00:01:08.880> we'll<00:01:09.880> we'll<00:01:10.720> sweep<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.170> up<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.619> we'll

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
then we'll we'll sweep it up and we'll

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.120 
then we'll we'll sweep it up and we'll
make<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.670> judgment<00:01:13.090> call<00:01:13.830> sometimes<00:01:14.830> we'll<00:01:15.009> say

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
make a judgment call sometimes we'll say

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.200 
make a judgment call sometimes we'll say
let's<00:01:15.250> go<00:01:15.429> ahead<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.670> go<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:15.910> second

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
let's go ahead and go to that second

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.180 
let's go ahead and go to that second
direction<00:01:16.690> there's<00:01:17.200> other<00:01:17.380> times<00:01:17.619> where<00:01:17.890> one

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
direction there's other times where one

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.719 
direction there's other times where one
is<00:01:18.369> sufficient<00:01:18.940> we<00:01:19.690> came<00:01:19.929> in<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.399> top<00:01:21.399> dressed

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
is sufficient we came in and top dressed

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.400 
is sufficient we came in and top dressed
it<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.119> now<00:01:22.390> we're<00:01:22.630> going<00:01:22.780> back<00:01:22.899> with<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> solid

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
it and now we're going back with a solid

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.060 
it and now we're going back with a solid
tide<00:01:24.750> usually<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.259> we'll<00:01:26.440> do<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.770> just

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
tide usually you know we'll do that just

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.559 
tide usually you know we'll do that just
to<00:01:27.130> try<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.310> get<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.640> sin<00:01:27.850> really<00:01:28.090> down<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
to try to get the sin really down in the

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.740 
to try to get the sin really down in the
profile<00:01:29.020> i<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.880> just<00:01:31.090> feel<00:01:31.390> like<00:01:31.509> when<00:01:31.660> we

just got back from a conference and we

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.970 
just got back from a conference and we
toured<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.850> research<00:04:31.630> facility<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.139> has<00:04:32.800> some

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
toured a research facility that has some

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.409 
toured a research facility that has some
in-depth<00:04:33.310> trials<00:04:33.610> with<00:04:33.700> some<00:04:33.820> new<00:04:33.940> grasses

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
in-depth trials with some new grasses

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.570 
in-depth trials with some new grasses
and<00:04:34.570> stuff<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.260> I<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:36.010> able<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.220> pick<00:04:36.430> out

and stuff and and I was able to pick out

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.550 
and stuff and and I was able to pick out
celebration<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.240> was<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.419> darkest<00:04:37.780> one<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.169> them

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
celebration it was a darkest one of them

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.500 
celebration it was a darkest one of them
all<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.040> I<00:04:39.280> went<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.090> when<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.270> was<00:04:40.389> like

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
all so I went to that when I was like

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.879 
all so I went to that when I was like
what's<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:40.840> plot<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.320> sure<00:04:41.530> enough<00:04:41.560> he'll

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
what's this plot and sure enough he'll

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.659 
what's this plot and sure enough he'll
to<00:04:41.979> celebration<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.680> it's<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.770> good<00:04:44.979> good<00:04:45.370> color

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
to celebration so it's a good good color

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.510 
to celebration so it's a good good color
and<00:04:46.030> like<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.660> said<00:04:47.130> when<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.220> manage<00:04:48.400> your

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
and like I said when you manage your

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.090 
and like I said when you manage your
thatch<00:04:48.850> its<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.930> brings<00:04:50.320> on<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> texture<00:04:50.860> that

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
thatch its it brings on the texture that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.460 
thatch its it brings on the texture that
that<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.310> really<00:04:51.580> like<00:04:52.290> personally<00:04:53.290> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
that I really like personally the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.800 
that I really like personally the
cutting<00:04:53.950> height<00:04:54.210> once<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.360> reach<00:04:55.570> over

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
cutting height once you reach over

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.180 
cutting height once you reach over
three-quarters<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.680> an<00:04:56.889> inch

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
three-quarters of an inch

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.710 
three-quarters of an inch
I<00:04:57.280> feel<00:04:57.910> like<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.120> takes<00:04:58.300> on<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.479> little<00:04:58.630> bit

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
I feel like it takes on a little bit

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.300 
I feel like it takes on a little bit
more<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.020> characteristic<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.889> I<00:04:59.919> don't

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
more of that characteristic that I don't

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.260 
more of that characteristic that I don't
wipe<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.790> little<00:05:00.820> bit<00:05:01.090> thinner<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.830> I've<00:05:03.430> we<00:05:04.150> use

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
wipe a little bit thinner so I've we use

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.850 
wipe a little bit thinner so I've we use
the<00:05:04.389> straw<00:05:04.570> for<00:05:04.750> season<00:05:05.050> around<00:05:05.229> 1/2<00:05:05.530> an<00:05:05.740> inch

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the straw for season around 1/2 an inch

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.940 
the straw for season around 1/2 an inch
and<00:05:06.820> then<00:05:07.090> we'll<00:05:07.419> work<00:05:07.630> it<00:05:07.780> up<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.169> maybe<00:05:08.650> 5

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
and then we'll work it up to maybe 5

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.890 
and then we'll work it up to maybe 5
eighths<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.430> maybe<00:05:10.240> just<00:05:10.450> a<00:05:10.510> little<00:05:10.750> above

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
eighths and maybe just a little above

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.430 
eighths and maybe just a little above
maybe<00:05:11.110> 650<00:05:11.620> buddy<00:05:12.100> by<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.520> end<00:05:12.760> of<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.910> season

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
maybe 650 buddy by the end of the season
