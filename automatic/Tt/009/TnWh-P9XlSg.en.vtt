00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.219
 welcome to learn by doing 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.039
 My name is Juan Pablo Rivers Chestnut Center Instructor for training 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.460
 road I never thought 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.909
 today we are going to learn 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.589
 How to make a planter and care to maintain 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.939
 to establish a planter 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.189
 we need first then all the plants 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.279
 bushehr outdoor plants or indoor plants indoor silver as its 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.550
 purpose is the mental are the leaves the outdoor plants their purpose 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.440
 rosenthal are the flowers we need a flowerpot 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 from 60 to new 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.100
 a substrate of 100 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.250
 which has three components 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.089
 an organic fertilizer a black earth 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.550
 i a rose husk as filling material 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.740
 we also need 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.080
 a watering can a garden kit a pair of pruning shears and a fertilizer 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.130
 chemical 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.360
 in this opportunity we select to plant to earn money pakistan chis 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.770
 Nanos of lauros as it is commonly known 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.770
 we started preparing the substrate always 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 For each stroke of organic matter we use two shovels of black earth and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.160
 two rice husk shovels the amount depends on the container that 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.280
 We are going to use 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.670
 to prevent the substrate hi roots 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 plug the drain holes we use waste tt we can do 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.299
 we deposit the substrate in the pot until 50% of it is removed 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.690
 the container of the plants selected for planting 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.320
 arranging in the largest in the center and the smallest ones towards 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 extremes 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.610
 continue adding the substrate in the pot up to one centimeter below 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 from the edge 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 so that the plants are firm we press with the tips of the fingers 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.240
 the substrate of 100 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.409
 to complement the planting, add moss 4 grams of fertilizer per each 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.120
 plan 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.310
 this should be done in the form of a retreating crescent burst to not burn 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.799
 to finish the hydrata moss and so our gardener is ready 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.159
 the plants whose mental return are the flowers 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.339
 we must locate the places covered but with very good light and very good there 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.159
 he saw action to make him maintenance lengthened was we should water it 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.499
 minimum three times a week 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.290
 fertilize once a month and add organic fertilizer every six 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:38.419
 months permanently had to remove dry leaves and wilted flowers I hope 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.479
 that have learned to establish a gardener 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.479
