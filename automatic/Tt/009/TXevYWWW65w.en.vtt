00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
wish I'd have known this when I was you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.889 
wish I'd have known this when I was you
know<00:00:05.549> started<00:00:05.940> working<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.270> these<00:00:06.420> things<00:00:06.660> is

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
know started working on these things is

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.160 
know started working on these things is
two<00:00:07.500> string<00:00:07.890> sweeps<00:00:08.719> and<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.990> really

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
two string sweeps and this is really

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.780 
two string sweeps and this is really
good<00:00:10.380> fun<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.800> let's<00:00:10.950> check<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.219> out

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
good fun so let's check this out

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.360 
good fun so let's check this out
we'll<00:00:12.300> do<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.450> around<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.870> twelfth<00:00:13.200> fret<00:00:13.370> and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we'll do it around the twelfth fret and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.950 
we'll do it around the twelfth fret and
we'll<00:00:14.519> take<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.059> standard<00:00:15.450> kind<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> major

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
we'll take the standard kind of major

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.470 
we'll take the standard kind of major
arpeggio<00:00:16.470> sound<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.369> across<00:00:17.640> two<00:00:17.880> strings<00:00:18.210> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
arpeggio sound but across two strings so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.830 
arpeggio sound but across two strings so
we're<00:00:19.109> gonna<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.410> pull<00:00:19.740> off<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.039> 15<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> 12

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
we're gonna do pull off from 15 to 12

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
we're gonna do pull off from 15 to 12
and<00:00:21.840> then<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.619> note<00:00:22.859> thirteenth<00:00:23.519> fret

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and then one other note thirteenth fret

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.259 
and then one other note thirteenth fret
on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> second<00:00:24.150> string<00:00:25.460> one<00:00:26.460> two<00:00:26.640> three<00:00:26.970> four

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
on the second string one two three four

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
on the second string one two three four
so<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.599> really<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> sixteenth<00:00:28.470> note

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so it's really like a sixteenth note

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380 
so it's really like a sixteenth note
patent<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.340> picked<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.939> it'll

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
patent so if I picked all that it'll

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.410 
patent so if I picked all that it'll
sound<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.720> okay<00:00:35.059> even<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> pull

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
sound like this okay even with a pull

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.660 
sound like this okay even with a pull
off

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.730 

now<00:00:43.670> if<00:00:43.760> Sun<00:00:43.970> was<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.150> really<00:00:44.600> fantastic<00:00:45.080> picker

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
now if Sun was a really fantastic picker

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.880 
now if Sun was a really fantastic picker
they<00:00:45.860> can<00:00:45.980> get<00:00:46.130> that<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:46.520> know<00:00:46.880> pretty<00:00:47.150> fast

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
they can get that you know pretty fast

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.170 
they can get that you know pretty fast
sounding<00:00:48.890> good<00:00:49.040> but<00:00:49.310> it's<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.580> lot<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.850> work<00:00:50.000> in

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
sounding good but it's a lot of work in

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.030 
sounding good but it's a lot of work in
the<00:00:50.240> right<00:00:50.420> hand<00:00:50.720> if<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.290> do<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.500> as<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.650> sweep

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
the right hand if you do it as a sweep

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.360 
the right hand if you do it as a sweep
what<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.880> do<00:00:52.970> is<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.180> start<00:00:53.390> on<00:00:53.570> an<00:00:53.630> upstroke

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
what you do is you start on an upstroke

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.270 
what you do is you start on an upstroke
off<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:57.080> then<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.380> next<00:00:57.440> two<00:00:57.830> notes

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
off and then the next two notes

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:12.670 
off and then the next two notes
downs<00:01:09.910> you<00:01:10.910> got<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.330> get<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.140> timing<00:01:12.440> of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
downs you got to get the the timing of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.500 
downs you got to get the the timing of
the<00:01:12.800> two<00:01:12.950> hands<00:01:13.370> really<00:01:13.940> locked<00:01:14.150> in<00:01:14.270> that's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
the two hands really locked in that's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.330 
the two hands really locked in that's
the<00:01:14.600> hardest<00:01:14.900> bit<00:01:14.990> about<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:16.070> so

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the hardest bit about it but it's so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.880 
the hardest bit about it but it's so
much<00:01:16.550> less<00:01:17.000> effort<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:18.200> get<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.500> pattern

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
much less effort to get that pattern

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.960 
much less effort to get that pattern
it's<00:01:19.010> just<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.250> really<00:01:20.500> tight<00:01:21.550> sort<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:22.700> sound

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
it's just a really tight sort of a sound

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.630 
it's just a really tight sort of a sound
so<00:01:23.390> then<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.500> move<00:01:24.650> that<00:01:24.830> through<00:01:25.280> an

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
so then you can move that through an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.910 
so then you can move that through an
abundance<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.330> different<00:01:26.690> shapes<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.229> kind

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
abundance of different shapes and kind

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:41.110 
abundance of different shapes and kind
of<00:01:27.979> different<00:01:28.310> sequences<00:01:28.490> such<00:01:29.060> as<00:01:29.119> this

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.730 

okay<00:01:42.120> wasn't<00:01:42.390> played<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.660> well<00:01:42.870> you<00:01:43.440> get<00:01:43.620> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
okay wasn't played that well you get the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.630 
okay wasn't played that well you get the
general<00:01:43.920> gist<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.300> think<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> maybe<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
general gist of it I think so maybe the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
general gist of it I think so maybe the
next<00:01:47.790> shape<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.230> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
next shape to do would be one of the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.140 
next shape to do would be one of the
minor<00:01:49.940> patterns<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.890> 17th<00:01:52.890> fret<00:01:53.100> pull<00:01:53.880> off<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
minor patterns so 17th fret pull off to

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.200 
minor patterns so 17th fret pull off to
the<00:01:54.240> 13th<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.250> 15th<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.910> second

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the 13th and then 15th on the second

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.350 
the 13th and then 15th on the second
string<00:01:57.650> so<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.729> between<00:02:05.820> those<00:02:06.119> two

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
string so just going between those two

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.390 
string so just going between those two
we<00:02:06.540> looked<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.800> great<00:02:13.950> thing<00:02:14.100> about<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
we looked at the great thing about the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.040 
we looked at the great thing about the
two<00:02:14.550> note<00:02:14.730> ones<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> only<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.450> alter<00:02:15.870> one

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
two note ones the only if the alter one

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.900 
two note ones the only if the alter one
note<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.530> pattern<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.070> you'll<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.670> doing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
note in that pattern and you'll be doing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.760 
note in that pattern and you'll be doing
a<00:02:18.000> completely<00:02:18.510> different<00:02:18.720> appear<00:02:19.050> oh<00:02:19.320> so<00:02:19.590> for

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
a completely different appear oh so for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.220 
a completely different appear oh so for
example<00:02:20.190> after<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.239> last<00:02:21.540> one<00:02:21.870> which<00:02:22.080> was

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
example after that last one which was

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.400 
example after that last one which was
the<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.709> major<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.720> change<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.350> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
the the major if we change it so that it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.440 
the the major if we change it so that it
was<00:02:25.500> 15<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> 12<00:02:26.489> on<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> first<00:02:26.970> string<00:02:27.209> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
was 15 to the 12 on the first string and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.650 
was 15 to the 12 on the first string and
then<00:02:28.140> twelfth<00:02:28.530> fret<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> second<00:02:29.660> we've

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
then twelfth fret on the second we've

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.880 
then twelfth fret on the second we've
now<00:02:30.810> moved<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.350> different<00:02:31.410> minor

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
now moved into a different minor

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.149 
now moved into a different minor
inversion<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.229 

okay<00:02:42.159> so<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.640> easy<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.940> come<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.180> with

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
okay so it's really easy to come up with

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.000 
okay so it's really easy to come up with
different<00:02:43.390> shapes<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.500> different<00:02:44.560> patterns

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
different shapes and different patterns

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.860 
different shapes and different patterns
so<00:02:45.519> you're<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.849> string<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.180> edgy<00:02:46.330> O's<00:02:46.480> that's<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so you're to string up edgy O's that's a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.059 
so you're to string up edgy O's that's a
whole<00:02:47.019> lot<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> fun

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
whole lot of fun

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.910 
whole lot of fun
another<00:02:48.640> cool<00:02:48.819> thing<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.650> basically<00:02:50.650> anything

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
another cool thing is basically anything

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.229 
another cool thing is basically anything
that<00:02:51.159> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.340> play<00:02:51.519> on<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.730> first<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that you can play on that first and

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.320 
that you can play on that first and
second<00:02:52.629> string<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.830> be<00:02:53.860> mirrored<00:02:54.370> exactly<00:02:55.000> on

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
second string can be mirrored exactly on

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.559 
second string can be mirrored exactly on
the<00:02:55.930> third<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.620> fourth<00:02:56.890> strings<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.489> also<00:02:58.450> on

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
the third or fourth strings and also on

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.899 
the third or fourth strings and also on
the<00:02:58.659> fifth<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:58.989> sixth<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:00.760> take

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
the fifth and sixth so you could take

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.839 
the fifth and sixth so you could take
that<00:03:00.940> exact<00:03:01.360> same<00:03:01.510> pattern<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:03.280> move<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.700> down

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
that exact same pattern and move it down

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.580 
that exact same pattern and move it down
an<00:03:04.000> octave<00:03:04.090> or<00:03:04.480> even<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.019> exactly<00:03:05.440> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
an octave or even just in exactly the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.009 
an octave or even just in exactly the
same<00:03:05.620> frets<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:07.269> just<00:03:07.450> take<00:03:07.599> those<00:03:07.750> same

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
same frets and just take those same

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.110 
same frets and just take those same
shapes<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.739> same<00:03:08.980> same<00:03:09.879> same<00:03:09.909> same

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
shapes you get the same same same same

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.750 
shapes you get the same same same same
same<00:03:10.329> idea
