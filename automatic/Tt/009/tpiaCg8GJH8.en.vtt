suddenly started turning French to the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.620 
suddenly started turning French to the
English<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.950> this<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.280> lots<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:02.940> kind

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
English so this was really lots of kind

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.590 
English so this was really lots of kind
of<00:01:03.750> confusion<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.339> further<00:01:06.030> problem

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of confusion and then further problem

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
of confusion and then further problem
that<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> realised<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.470> wasn't<00:01:07.649> like<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
that I realised I wasn't like all the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
that I realised I wasn't like all the
other<00:01:08.640> boys<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.329> because<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.659> didn't

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
other boys around me because I didn't

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.770 
other boys around me because I didn't
really<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.170> football<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.969> wasn't<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.540> kind

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really like football and I wasn't a kind

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.649 
really like football and I wasn't a kind
of<00:01:12.869> typical<00:01:13.079> rough<00:01:13.770> English<00:01:14.430> schoolboy<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
of typical rough English schoolboy I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.530 
of typical rough English schoolboy I
wanted<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> sit<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.740> read<00:01:16.890> poetry<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
wanted to sit and read poetry so this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.630 
wanted to sit and read poetry so this
was<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.960> strange<00:01:19.350> thing<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.430> well

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
was a bit of a strange thing as well

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
was a bit of a strange thing as well
then<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.030> realised<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.510> I<00:01:21.750> didn't<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.440> go

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
then I realised that I didn't want to go

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.170 
then I realised that I didn't want to go
and<00:01:22.710> work<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> banker<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.820> City<00:01:24.090> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
London even though most of the men in my

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.880 
London even though most of the men in my
family<00:01:26.640> had<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> business<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.290> realized

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
family had been in business I realized

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
family had been in business I realized
that<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.040> wasn't<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.820> hopeless<00:01:30.270> at

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that I wasn't I was be hopeless at

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
that I wasn't I was be hopeless at
business<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.260> I<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.920> was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
business so what was I going to do I was

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
business so what was I going to do I was
going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> become<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.700> writer<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.540> no<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:33.930> had

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going to become a writer so no one had

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
going to become a writer so no one had
ever<00:01:34.229> been<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> writer<00:01:34.770> anywhere<00:01:35.310> near<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.729> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
ever been a writer anywhere near me so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.010 
ever been a writer anywhere near me so
that<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.690> really<00:01:36.990> strange<00:01:37.310> identity<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
that was a really strange identity so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
that was a really strange identity so
constant<00:01:40.020> identity<00:01:40.860> crises<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:43.260> constant

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
constant identity crises and constant

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.310 
constant identity crises and constant
feeling<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.640> quite<00:01:44.909> being<00:01:45.119> normal<00:01:46.110> or

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
feeling of not quite being normal or

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.050 
feeling of not quite being normal or

fitting in one of the great solutions of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
fitting in one of the great solutions of
writing<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.780> create<00:01:52.170> your

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
writing is that you can create your

writing is that you can create your
identity<00:01:53.159> through<00:01:54.150> words<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.590> nowadays<00:01:55.770> when

identity through words so nowadays when

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.880 
identity through words so nowadays when
people<00:01:56.400> say<00:01:56.549> who<00:01:57.030> are<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:58.259> best<00:01:58.500> answer<00:01:58.860> is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
people say who are you my best answer is
