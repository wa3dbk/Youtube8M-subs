it's<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.720> nice<00:00:39.899> speaker<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.449> think<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
it's very nice speaker and I think it

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.819 
it's very nice speaker and I think it
can<00:00:43.019> work<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.589> different

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can work in a lot of different

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
can work in a lot of different
applications<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> alnico<00:00:45.750> characteristics

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
applications the alnico characteristics

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.960 
applications the alnico characteristics
that<00:00:46.710> people<00:00:46.769> like<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.400> chime<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.909> the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
that people like with the chime and the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.119 
that people like with the chime and the
compression<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:48.659> you<00:00:48.750> crank<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.409> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
compression when you crank it up and I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.579 
compression when you crank it up and I
think<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.150> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> good<00:00:51.839> new<00:00:52.170> offering<00:00:52.559> from

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
think it's it's a good new offering from

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
on the trouble pickup and so we're gonna

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.540 
play through the same speaker and see
what<00:01:04.559> would<00:01:04.649> come<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.160> with

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
what would come out with with

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
characteristics of that this will be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:32.300 
characteristics of that this will be
pretty<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.190> on<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.399> clean<00:01:08.610> setting

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
okay let's turn off the gate on the app

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.570 
okay let's turn off the gate on the app
a<00:01:34.390> little<00:01:34.660> bit<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.990> get<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> little<00:01:35.740> natural<00:01:36.430> -

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
okay here we are with the preamp gain

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.889 
okay here we are with the preamp gain
all<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.430> way<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.509> what<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.720> thing

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
again turn it up the compression steps

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.729 
again turn it up the compression steps
in<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.370> highs<00:02:44.520> are<00:02:44.760> still<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.739> ringing
