hello everyone what a top requests I get
is<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> build<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.650> strawberry<00:00:14.070> tower<00:00:14.280> this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
is how to build a strawberry tower this

video will display all the necessary

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.300 
video will display all the necessary
steps<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.490> build<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:18.029> own<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.830> first<00:00:20.070> step

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
steps to build your own the first step

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.700 
steps to build your own the first step
is<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.880> place<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.270> mark<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.750> each<00:00:22.140> end<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
is to place a mark on each end of the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150 
is to place a mark on each end of the
pipe<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.760> rotate<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> 180<00:00:24.750> degrees<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.710> Mark

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
pipe then rotate it 180 degrees and Mark

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
pipe then rotate it 180 degrees and Mark
the<00:00:26.310> other<00:00:26.490> end<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.539> snap<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> line<00:00:28.289> down<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the other end then snap a line down the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.130 
the other end then snap a line down the
entire<00:00:29.039> length<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> pipe<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.150> could<00:00:30.990> also

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
entire length of the pipe you could also

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.810 
entire length of the pipe you could also
use<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> straight<00:00:31.830> edge<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.009> mark<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.669> line

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
use a straight edge to mark your line

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.670 
use a straight edge to mark your line
but<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> find<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> chalk<00:00:34.020> line<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.500> much

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
but I find the chalk line to be much

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.670 
but I find the chalk line to be much
more<00:00:34.920> accurate<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.579> easier<00:00:36.320> turn<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> pipe

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
more accurate and easier turn the pipe

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.490 
more accurate and easier turn the pipe
over<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.250> snap<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.670> second<00:00:39.030> line<00:00:42.290> along<00:00:43.290> each

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
over and snap a second line along each

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
over and snap a second line along each
line<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.219> place<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> series<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> marks

the bottom pocket should not be filled

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.830 
the bottom pocket should not be filled
with<00:05:37.310> anything<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.150> can<00:05:38.360> clean<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.690> base

strong support filling each pocket can
be<00:06:19.040> a<00:06:19.070> challenge<00:06:19.550> so<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.060> made<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.390> trade<00:06:20.900> type

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
be a challenge so I made a trade type

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.770 
be a challenge so I made a trade type
funnel<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:21.919> speed<00:06:22.190> up<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.400> process<00:06:22.880> take<00:06:23.750> a

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
funnel to speed up the process take a

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.690 
funnel to speed up the process take a
section<00:06:24.110> of<00:06:24.320> pipe<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.800> do<00:06:24.980> a<00:06:25.010> cut<00:06:25.310> down<00:06:25.460> its

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
section of pipe and do a cut down its

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.210 
section of pipe and do a cut down its
length<00:06:25.910> heat<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.870> entire<00:06:27.200> piece<00:06:27.560> so<00:06:27.950> it<00:06:28.070> can

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
length heat the entire piece so it can

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.700 
length heat the entire piece so it can
be<00:06:28.310> flattened<00:06:28.790> then<00:06:29.270> bend<00:06:29.600> up<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:29.930> edges<00:06:30.290> so

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
be flattened then bend up the edges so

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.370 
be flattened then bend up the edges so
it<00:06:30.860> forms<00:06:31.280> a<00:06:31.430> v-shape

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:47.010 

I<00:06:44.550> created<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.700> crosscut<00:06:45.970> section<00:06:46.690> so<00:06:46.930> you

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
I created a crosscut section so you

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.200 
I created a crosscut section so you
could<00:06:47.170> see<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.530> inside<00:06:47.680> of<00:06:48.010> the<00:06:48.070> tower<00:06:48.280> please

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
could see the inside of the tower please

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.730 
could see the inside of the tower please
note<00:06:49.450> that<00:06:49.480> the<00:06:49.720> sample<00:06:49.930> is<00:06:50.170> done<00:06:50.410> with<00:06:50.560> black

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.220 
note that the sample is done with black
ABS<00:06:51.250> so<00:06:51.700> you<00:06:51.790> can<00:06:51.970> see<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.240> various<00:06:52.630> surfaces

easier<00:06:53.710> each<00:06:54.490> pocket<00:06:55.060> will<00:06:55.180> hold<00:06:55.360> about<00:06:55.480> five

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
easier each pocket will hold about five
