 all these beautiful movies 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.580
 you come back with a film of abel ferrara 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.220
 called mary mary special price the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.370
 jury at the last festival of venice with 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.950
 so matthew modine forest whitaker

 marion cotillard is you who is our 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.580
 invited tonight 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 so 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.730
 marie is the story of an actress who 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.459
 plays the role of marie madeleine and who 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.189
 eventually leave everything to continue his 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.849
 quest for spirituality is who marries 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.019
 madeleine first big puzzles of 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.930
 study a prostitute for the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.060
 gospels not for those who have translated 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.280
 the gospel that is when we go 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.760
 to the origins of the demos ie the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.530
 Greek 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.180
 she was never prostituted she 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.069
 was considered a sinner but to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.530
 the sin era could very well 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.439
 to say a woman who was not Jewish married 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.239
 and who had no children is what we 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.409
 know of her it's pretty mysterious we've 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.040
 different points of view because there are 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.359
 different gospel sound documents 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.169
 very few sound documents unless 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:16.560
 our language the laws and we discovered 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:18.389
 in 1945 there was a gospel she 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.639
 had written and that was found in 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.209
 egypt beneath the sands hide as 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:26.430
 philippe's and one can read in 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.349
 feast that she was an insider and she 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 was also initiator she has in addition to 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.519
 a direct teaching of jesus she the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.079
 finds transcribed in his gospel and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.269
 she was there when Jesus 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.419
 turned into light we call 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.889
 that the resurrection and she was chosen 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.810
 she had the opportunity to see him and 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.329
 to announce it is actually the skin of 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.310
 apostles so this is an iconoclastic film 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.560
 therefore since it is based not on 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.629
 traditional gospels but on 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.229
 the gospel to the benefit of marie madeleine 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.750
 this is my daughter 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.750
 ok I work I kiss you 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.750
 House 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.510
 his daughter then she is fine very well 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.390
 the backs everything is fine we range 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.040
 then evaluation of marie madeleine in 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.109
 this movie because in religion in 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.049
 does the only female figure this is the 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.670
 virgin and that is to say on the street in 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.169
 Christian religions are the virgin 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.270
 so symbolized by marie and there is the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.180
 prostitute prostitutes is not the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.380
 woman and fall the archetype of the woman 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 she stokes definitely pushed because 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.699
 that it's embarrassing because the body rhymes 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.800
 with guilt in the in the 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.060
 religion in a general way then 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.580
 that there may be way to see it 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.770
 otherwise this film to seven ministers a 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.050
 German have totally but feminine I 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.680
 would say it goes beyond party 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.680
 taken this is it puts back in place the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.599
 feminine to be able to be masculine because 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.190
 that if there is no other side there is 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.080
 no balance is the first time 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.180
 in addition that a woman speaks of Jesus with 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.940
 men who would be of a woman this 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.009
 extraordinary of a building says that I 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.620
 am catholic trend marie madeleine 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.539
 - so marie madeleine is someone 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.250
 who throw themselves at the feet of Jesus and who 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.960
 follow it to the end because it's 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.550
 someone who surely needed 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.470
 of absolute who was in a big 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.470
 despair story yeah that's this 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.139
 experience has left a mark on you 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.780
 spiritual plan non juliette life me 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.430
 tired of all the ways but what 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.590
 I like it back to questions 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.490
 fundamental of the child why I 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.310
 am here what am I doing here 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.849
 who am I why what is watching me 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.849
 like that 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:42.689
 to the street and finally instead of 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.339
 shut yourself in a form that could 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.599
 to call oneself religion but ultimately if one 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.519
 returns to the original text 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.119
 it allows to have a new look and 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:52.919
 to make his own his own way 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:54.209
 here you think that spiritual is the 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.559
 only thing that can get us out of 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:59.249
 shit in which we are today 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:00.449
 love love so let's look at 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.679
 what does it look like look at your camera 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.149
 Juliette you will say magneto serge 

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:05.149
 it's super simple magneto
