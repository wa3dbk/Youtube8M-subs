00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 In this hospital, some patients are being treated for watercourses such as kalura 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 This girl drank unhealthy water from the Malawi River and is now suffering 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 I live near the river, and I know that the water there is unclean but sometimes when 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 There was a scarcity of water forced to go there and brought diamonds for cooking and washing 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Quoting WHO and UNICEF, more than one billion people can not afford safe water 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 This is the cause of suffering 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 In February, at Korakurter Hospital, chlorinated disease killed 16 people 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Worldwide, 3 million people die every year from diseases caused by unclean water 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Increasing access to wastewater is a major challenge in Third World countries 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 But a watercourse called WaterCone could help millions of people make potable water 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 L all the time 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 "Water Cone" is a plastic funnel based on sunlight to make potable water 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Eng. Hans Drus works in German factories showing us how the machine works 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Firstly 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Place a quantity of salt water in a dish and then cover it with a capillary lid 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Because of the heat of the sun, water evaporates and condenses on the dish from the inside 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Intensive water is usable water 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 The water drips after it condenses into where it collects on the edges of the repression 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Slowly the water condenses on the sides 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Lift the repressive cover where the potable water is collected on the repression 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 By way of an exit from the funnel you can pour water into a glass or gallon 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 You can produce 6 to 7 cups like this in 24 hours 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 As you can see the quality of water 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Its taste is good
