 I think it 's creative it's clear we have 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.420
 what to look for in these stickers 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 from the supra where they are very good is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.820

 he likes you and you know what we're talking about 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.219
 whenever they can have an exit 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.420
 labor that is important and on the other 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.490
 side that is easy to do because of course 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.700
 I just will encourage me to do so Martin 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.530

 they listen good artísimas thanks of the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.549
 throat yes good let's get to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.880
 work to the half sir you take a 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.409
 tecito and it gets better and what do you think 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.420
 If I tell you what materials we are going to 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.819
 work we will work with the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.520
 ultra transparent bars of supra 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.799
 gone are the famous hotmail that 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.140
 he always named them go to the hardware store to 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.119
 the bookstores or the hypermarkets and there 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.549
 they get them without any problem and 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.729
 obviously the gun also of his 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.560
 proclaim that whenever I use it sometimes I 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.239
 forgot to tell you today had not agreed to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.310
 tell them that it is important to have this 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.170
 type of guns and not any of the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 that one buys that sometimes they are from some 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 place that we do not know well and are not 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.200
 under the rules were essential because 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's not forget that this kind of 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.710
 jobs that we are going to do 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.330
 are connected to electricity 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.520
 we touch with our hands and sometimes we have 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.380
 hands wet or a little wet and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.970
 we can have a problem then 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.740
 when we buy tools elements 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.810
 any kind of tool always 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.800
 pay attention to buy good quality because 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.430
 it's something that we're going to use in 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.710
 home 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.470
 said this then let's work 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.810
 on a glass the allowance in this case 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.850
 is working on a block quoted from 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.070
 metal can be a fish tank or on the table 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.080
 of home is without any problem and what 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.820
 let's do is the following for 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.280
 start decorating and we're going to put it together 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.220
 let's decorate let's make small 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.209
 downloads look how easy in it 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.880
 place I do not touch with the tip of the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.980
 gun the metal or the countertop of your house 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.860
 I do not touch, look how I'm doing 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.450
 downloads and I'm leaving 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.610
 that goes well working look how easy 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.080
 that movement that I do at the end is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.090
 so that the thread is this last lithium 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 stay there and not be anywhere other than 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.819
 after annoying come so let's go 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.730
 doing several downloads is important 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.470
 here that you leave that hot 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.160
 then the gun so that the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.500
 material have good output 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.450
 because if it's not going to cost more and it's not going 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
 to stay with this gem type shape 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.940
 look at how much we can do 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.290
 see that as I go working 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.140
 begins to solidify a little 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.580
 because I do not give him time to go 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.590
 heating then what are we going to go 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.240
 doing is spinning he sent several and we're going 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.130
 waiting for all this to work for 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.350
 to be able to take them out as nothing because I 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.450
 It works super fast and it remains super part 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.340
 crystal clear so look at me I already know them 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.110
 play a costadito and here I have armed 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.420
 these that are already dry see how 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.520
 they look are very transparent 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.440
 they are super transparent they are very 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.450
 easy to remove because I knew right away 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.400
 they immediately work without any problem and 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.630
 I 'm going to show you another detail that I made 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.540
 also these that I already have here 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.880
 it's good that I'm going away randomly what I'm going 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.770
 to do is the following I will place a 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.129
 little dot like that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.969
 and I'm going to place 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.969
 in this way 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.640
 these three so that to arm these 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.290
 little flowers that are going to see that in a place 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.600
 I already put them as to decorate 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.950
 then I hold it there is a little bit and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.410
 this way we are going to put together these 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.700
 little flowers that I have here well then 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.140
 to give a different touch we are going to 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.580
 put gems on one side and on the other 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.890
 side these little flowers that we put together with 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.140
 three gems and a little bit of adhesive 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.240
 once we have several of these 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.130
 armed we will then take the piece 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.690
 of glass which can be the piece of 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.760
 glass that you have girls 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.740
 I say more if you have some glass 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.600
 broken a broken vase that was shaved and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.280
 they want him very much he made a knot and I stick it 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.620
 but when I hit it you can see the crack 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.840
 good is a good way to get it back 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.790
 and having that old vase in the house 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.260
 you have love and somehow what 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.810
 We recycle what we're going to start 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.000
 do then it 's very easy with the same 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.070
 gun we are putting a little bit of 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.780
 material do not exaggerate and let's go 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.660
 placing then all the Semites 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.840
 one next to the other is very, very, very 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.100
 simple there is nothing else of the other world a 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.780
 Once they dry, they remove it 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.030
 these little tricks that are generated with 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.650
 the same material so nothing happens and 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.310
 what we can do is also go 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.780
 insert 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.310
 with these little flowers that we put together 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.220
 they are super cute then out there 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.020
 we put two and one flower or we can 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.630
 put all flowers on one side this is the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.460
 that was laid come and in this way 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.340
 then let's go working here here 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.930
 I have one that goes a little bit to 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.790
 that you see how we are playing 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.700
 in this case I was putting all the 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.370
 flowers around and then I'm generating 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.530
 the drawing that I want once you 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.330
 they put together the drawing they want, I'm going 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.790
 show a normite detail so you can see 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.530
 smaller half told me and how is this 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.450
 part here and something half as silver 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.700
 pewter something like that good that's what 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.590
 what I did I took graphite 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.570
 that we always use graphite because it's 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.880
 super good a little finger in the 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.700
 Norite graphite and what we are going to do 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.400
 is to look at how easy it is with your finger 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.530
 well the graphite 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.120
 what attack will drag I do not have to paint 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.740
 because they saw that sometimes they charge 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.500
 too much after enchastrar is a 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.570
 little bit like that with the graphite and then the 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.000
 graphite brush looks in the form of 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.250
 Paint is common is a powder is a powder 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.020
 I clear that it is well light 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.720
 then once we go through where 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.340
 we want it seems that there is not also I know 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.590
 what needs to be done must be fixed 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.720
 so it does not get out more then as 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.539
 fixed it with brush I grab the brush 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.039
 the ones bought same shoe brush and 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:03.550
 with brush notice how you are going to 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:05.380
 be metallized alcoa linda then 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.240
 with this we are metallized and we 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.370
 we put together that effect that we did in 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.350
 some flowers on the part of the demon and 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.660
 so let's go placing intensity that 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:18.130
 we want and we're decorating super fast 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:22.449
 super fast do not stop doing it out 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.430
 work calculation that is beautiful value 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:29.280
 added awesome because for your 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.280
 very expensive vase they saw that there is clear 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.180
 these decoration houses 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.120
 every time there is no price anymore for things 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:42.070
 but really this is beautiful 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.220
 this also the little one is also left 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:49.590
 super cute because the quotes more 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.590
 tiny and lovely 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:02.110
 thank you tomorrow we continue with the 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:07.440
 godfroid mónica teacher who paints 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.440
 on leprechaun flowers in a sillero bowl
