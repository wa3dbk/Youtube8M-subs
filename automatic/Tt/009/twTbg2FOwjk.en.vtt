00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it do this over and over again near the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.590 
it do this over and over again near the
walls<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.990> sometime<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> might<00:01:19.290> freeze<00:01:19.590> up

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
walls and sometime you might freeze up

really easily but while you're in it no
matter<00:02:11.420> what<00:02:11.660> move<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.110> try<00:02:13.210> almost<00:02:14.210> it's

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
matter what move you try almost it's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.550 
matter what move you try almost it's
like<00:02:14.720> one<00:02:15.050> of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:16.120> emus<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.630> web<00:02:18.230> moves

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
like one of the emus like web moves

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250 
like one of the emus like web moves
whatever<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:20.240> can't<00:02:20.510> really<00:02:20.750> break<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.140> when

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
whatever you can't really break you when

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.540 
whatever you can't really break you when
you're<00:02:21.410> inside<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.700> when<00:02:22.820> you're<00:02:22.940> outside

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
you're inside it but when you're outside

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.040 
you're inside it but when you're outside
it's<00:02:25.550> pretty<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:27.560> dead<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:29.780> it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
it's pretty like dead it's really it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's pretty like dead it's really it
work<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.500> practically<00:02:31.010> any<00:02:31.190> box<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:34.160> any

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
work with practically any box like any

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.510 
work with practically any box like any
wooden<00:02:34.850> box<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.530> was<00:02:36.860> my<00:02:37.040> favorite<00:02:37.400> is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
wooden box but that was my favorite is

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.650 
wooden box but that was my favorite is
easiest<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:40.360> yeah

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
easiest so yeah

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.309 
easiest so yeah
second<00:02:42.170> glitch

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.740 

okay<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:49.400> for<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> last<00:02:49.970> which<00:02:50.300> which<00:02:50.720> is

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
okay and for the last which which is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.610 
okay and for the last which which is
probably<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.830> easiest<00:02:52.069> one<00:02:52.810> when<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.930> climb

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
probably the easiest one when you climb

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.479
