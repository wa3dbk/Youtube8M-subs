00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
pegging point around the temp there are

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
pegging point around the temp there are
some<00:00:57.420> ventilation<00:00:57.719> panels<00:00:58.229> on<00:00:58.319> the<00:00:58.440> end<00:00:58.559> but

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
some ventilation panels on the end but

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.559 
some ventilation panels on the end but
they'll<00:00:59.159> be<00:00:59.190> easier<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.729> see<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> inside
