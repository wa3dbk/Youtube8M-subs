ebo<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.590> technical<00:02:32.860> part<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.460> the

ebo this is the technical part and the

intact<00:02:34.690> IG<00:02:35.590> LP<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.100> was<00:02:36.790> 298<00:02:37.690> percent<00:02:38.080> higher

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
intact IG LP one was 298 percent higher

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.150 
in the way group than the placebo itself
again<00:02:41.170> great<00:02:41.440> way<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.620> controlling<00:02:41.980> blood

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
again great way of controlling blood

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.680 
again great way of controlling blood
sugar<00:02:42.220> whey<00:02:42.970> protein<00:02:43.510> before<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.320> meal<00:02:44.500> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
sugar whey protein before the meal and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.460 
sugar whey protein before the meal and
much<00:02:46.690> better<00:02:46.900> control<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.290> your<00:02:47.350> blood

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
much better control of your blood

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.640 
much better control of your blood
