camera<00:02:28.900> settings<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:29.500> can<00:02:29.620> actually<00:02:29.770> see<00:02:30.190> that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
camera settings we can actually see that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.970 
camera settings we can actually see that
this<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.120> where<00:02:31.300> HTC<00:02:31.930> has<00:02:32.050> given<00:02:32.350> much<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
this is where HTC has given much of the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.730 
this is where HTC has given much of the
focus<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.060> really<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.660> rewarding<00:02:35.230> that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
focus and it really is rewarding that

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.070 
focus and it really is rewarding that
second<00:02:36.220> sensor<00:02:36.610> adds<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:37.000> lot<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.330> data<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.870> as

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
second sensor adds a lot of data and as

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.110 
second sensor adds a lot of data and as
a<00:02:38.110> result<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> lot<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.460> very<00:02:39.820> cool

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
a result you can do a lot of very cool

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.480 
a result you can do a lot of very cool
effects<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.900> free<00:02:41.620> loaded<00:02:41.920> one<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.310> images

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
effects I free loaded one of the images

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.690 
effects I free loaded one of the images
here<00:02:42.970> which<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.600> took<00:02:43.990> earlier<00:02:44.530> today<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:45.550> we

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
here which I I took earlier today and we

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.790 
here which I I took earlier today and we
can<00:02:45.820> see<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.180> some<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.870> addition<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.590> taking

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
can see that some in addition to taking

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.110 
can see that some in addition to taking
really<00:02:48.130> fast<00:02:48.580> snaps<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:50.880> foreground<00:02:51.880> and

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
really fast snaps the foreground and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.560 
really fast snaps the foreground and
background<00:02:53.040> subjects<00:02:54.040> are<00:02:54.220> manipulable<00:02:55.120> so

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
background subjects are manipulable so

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.010 
background subjects are manipulable so
for<00:02:56.170> example<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.890> them<00:02:57.480> with<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.900> new

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
for example with them with the new

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.790 
for example with them with the new
foreground<00:03:02.020> or<00:03:02.880> option<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.480> actually

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
foreground or option you can actually

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.790 
foreground or option you can actually
add<00:03:05.800> effects<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.760> defocus<00:03:07.690> option<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
add effects and the defocus option you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.580 
add effects and the defocus option you
can<00:03:09.070> selectively<00:03:10.110> refocus<00:03:11.110> an<00:03:11.260> image

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
can selectively refocus an image

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.120 
can selectively refocus an image
depending<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.870> four<00:03:14.170> or<00:03:14.320> background<00:03:14.860> so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
depending on your four or background so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.890 
depending on your four or background so
it's<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.970> interesting<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.720> is

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
it's really interesting and this is

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900 
it's really interesting and this is
actually<00:03:17.080> using<00:03:17.650> data<00:03:18.100> from<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.520> second

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
actually using data from the second

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.640 
actually using data from the second
sensor<00:03:19.210> it's<00:03:19.330> not<00:03:19.480> just<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.870> software<00:03:20.350> tweak

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
sensor it's not just a software tweak

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.290 
sensor it's not just a software tweak
the<00:03:21.580> D<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:23.050> foreground<00:03:23.980> er<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.370> mostly<00:03:25.030> just

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
the D the foreground er is mostly just

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.240 
the D the foreground er is mostly just
gimmicky<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.020> adds<00:03:26.170> some<00:03:26.320> really<00:03:26.650> cool<00:03:26.830> 3d

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
gimmicky but it adds some really cool 3d

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.830 
gimmicky but it adds some really cool 3d
effects<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.030> lot<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.450> people<00:03:28.720> are

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
effects that a lot of people are

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.600 
effects that a lot of people are
actually<00:03:28.990> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:29.830> I<00:03:29.890> i<00:03:30.130> really

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
actually going to like and I i really

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually going to like and I i really
think<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.150> people<00:03:31.750> are<00:03:31.840> going<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.110> share

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
think that people are going to share

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
think that people are going to share
differently<00:03:33.040> with<00:03:33.730> these<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.690> know<00:03:34.780> HTC

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
differently with these you know HTC

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.510 
differently with these you know HTC
added<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:35.830> bunch<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.280> flourishes<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
added a bunch of flourishes to the the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.570 
added a bunch of flourishes to the the
the<00:03:39.520> HTC<00:03:40.090> one<00:03:40.270> last<00:03:40.540> year<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.430> which

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
the HTC one last year and one of which

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.930 
the HTC one last year and one of which
was<00:03:42.760> HTC<00:03:43.420> Zoe<00:03:43.690> shot<00:03:44.470> which<00:03:44.770> takes<00:03:45.370> photos<00:03:45.670> and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
was HTC Zoe shot which takes photos and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.750 
was HTC Zoe shot which takes photos and
videos<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:46.390> those<00:03:47.290> were<00:03:47.590> not<00:03:47.980> really<00:03:48.370> well

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
videos but those were not really well

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.070 
videos but those were not really well
received<00:03:48.970> now<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.020> age<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.440> selfies

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
received now on this age of selfies

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.540 
received now on this age of selfies
these<00:03:53.080> effects<00:03:53.830> are<00:03:53.950> actually<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.460> be

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
these effects are actually going to be

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.630 
these effects are actually going to be
quite<00:03:55.510> quite<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.170> lot<00:03:56.320> nicer<00:03:56.500> here<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.340> can<00:03:57.460> see

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
quite quite a lot nicer here you can see

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.080 
quite quite a lot nicer here you can see
some<00:03:57.670> real-time<00:03:58.510> 3d<00:03:59.050> effects<00:03:59.440> added

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
some real-time 3d effects added

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.740 
some real-time 3d effects added
obviously<00:04:01.650> some<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.770> them<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.550> this<00:04:03.940> tilt<00:04:04.330> 3d

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
obviously some of them like this tilt 3d

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.050 
obviously some of them like this tilt 3d
effect<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.350> quite<00:04:06.070> cool<00:04:06.460> I<00:04:06.700> mean<00:04:06.850> it's<00:04:06.970> a

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
effect is quite cool I mean it's a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.090 
effect is quite cool I mean it's a
technology<00:04:07.390> demo<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.380> sense<00:04:08.650> use<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
technology demo in a sense use the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.910 
technology demo in a sense use the
accelerometer<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.970> show<00:04:10.209> different<00:04:10.920> data

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
accelerometer to show different data

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.580 
accelerometer to show different data
from<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.340> various<00:04:12.670> sensors<00:04:13.420> but<00:04:13.660> again<00:04:14.380> it's

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
from the various sensors but again it's

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.280 
from the various sensors but again it's
nothing<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.400> haven't<00:04:15.700> seen<00:04:15.910> before

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
nothing that you haven't seen before

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.530 
nothing that you haven't seen before
it's<00:04:17.290> just<00:04:17.590> done<00:04:17.799> better<00:04:18.070> now<00:04:18.970> comparing<00:04:19.480> it

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
it's just done better now comparing it

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.810 
it's just done better now comparing it
to<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.690> HTC<00:04:20.140> One<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.070> can<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.580> it's<00:04:21.729> a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
to the HTC One you can see that it's a

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.700 
to the HTC One you can see that it's a
little<00:04:22.060> bit<00:04:22.180> taller<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.660> little<00:04:22.810> bit<00:04:23.140> wider<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
little bit taller a little bit wider and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.730 
little bit taller a little bit wider and
it's<00:04:24.280> darker<00:04:25.000> but<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:26.020> not<00:04:26.169> until<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.530> pick

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
it's darker but it's not until you pick

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.000 
it's darker but it's not until you pick
it<00:04:26.860> up

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
it up

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.600 
it up
and<00:04:27.100> actually<00:04:27.250> hold<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:28.470> where<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:30.220> notice

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
and actually hold it where you notice

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.120 
and actually hold it where you notice
that<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.880> changes<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:32.170> new<00:04:32.380> HTC<00:04:32.740> One

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that the changes to the all new HTC One

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.850 
that the changes to the all new HTC One
are<00:04:33.690> significant<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.050> build<00:04:35.290> quality<00:04:35.530> is

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
are significant the build quality is
