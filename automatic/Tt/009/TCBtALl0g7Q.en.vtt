00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 welcome to a program presentation 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.929
 which allows you to watch a video 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 make that out wind doki yes and that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.699
 polanski often wanted to visit here 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 which I now explain in the big one 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.850
 Oranges one point could be the whole thing 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 stickman move 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:32.040
 after all, first here our template 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.219
 bigger seems a little red dots 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.219
 can you move your limbs 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 you can do that back and forth the size 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.250
 could change here and the color here 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.199
 appointment blue human and human here 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.460
 just like the one from our place to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 transport 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.320
 one enters here on centers flip the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.190
 we see now is marked I show 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.480
 even better since turned the simple to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 edit there could be a little bit 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.780
 For example, you can change giant trees here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780
 Add 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:29.229
 so do something then I could here 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.329
 new classic man alone open new 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.770
 animation right after the safe so the 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 memory expensive animation loud background 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.929
 background then you just open 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.929
 picture you have on the computer 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.020
 Size ratio fits perfectly is just 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:55.780
 a perfect pictures are and can here 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.450
 you then come to the window you can 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.280
 you completely new things exhibit it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.479
 It's easy, I can do it again 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.390
 show you always have the points 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.709
 on the other hand, that's where the water comes from 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.930
 ever having made such estimates 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:19.359
 Something yes the money needed 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.470
 actually never does not need at all 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.340
 he can forget that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.310
 to do now to create an animation 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.590
 Move that a bit for that 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.400
 Sometimes rice could be studied 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.380
 Make a frame here then you see 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.190
 this is the last frame here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.120
 moved makes so next the next 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.880
 So picture for picture best squeezes 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.880
 yes always changed uncomplicated 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.030
 Do you already have a few pictures of that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.310
 reports his feet that it is still 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.909
 times could be repeated here on repeat 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.159
 then it has to go through once 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.109
 stops if you just have a long time 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.030
 that he can just stop here 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.959
 You can give it your speed 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.959
 to adjust 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.750
 but so knows very slowly making 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:29.290
 stops that pleased even if you have the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.359
 According to Fischer then theirs could 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.659
 library from the program 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.870
 and then you can do that here 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.819
 I add an elephant and now 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.799
 that he shows right away with flip 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.900
 So turn around counter 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.379
 exactly in the other direction come that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.599
 the overrun but we do 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.989
 I could not be a stone now 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.709
 I already said unfortunately only one 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.019
 everyone knows band 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.989
 I've been here before 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.129
 prepared 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.129
 yes, it is not good though 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.359
 So it's really fun to do 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.609
 that's about halfway up now 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.210
 takes half an hour up here sees your 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.070
 frames we've already done all 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.360
 It is really only very small angle 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.040
 for example, if now a liquid 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.110
 movement is likely to have but because of 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.330
 if now networks liquid out so that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.470
 makes a lot of things 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.150
 the faster it runs the smoother 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.870
 Of course, it looks like I'm sitting, too 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.150
 as if it now so it looks from 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.860
 unpacks but yes anyone can do that for 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.840
 decide how to do it fast 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.310
 want 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.780
 there are already one here 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:05:02.570
 prefabricated not can you first 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.570
 many but if you crash 16 now 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.889
 hermann thiemann and his horse 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.889
 rises and out of the giants 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:32.050
 Here you see what you have everything with you 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.099
 on fx can add new and 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.060
 You can get new ones up here 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:38.159
 Foreign shows now that we are exactly 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.190
 to bring the middle 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.539
 Give it to the center and it was 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.199
 in fact, if you are 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.539
 have questions write in the comments it 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.550
 is really fun and it is 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.360
 I will free you downloadlink 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:09.449
 description of course and that's it 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:09.449
 then bye chris matches
