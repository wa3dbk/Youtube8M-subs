Kemal Lebanese style I'm going to show
you<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.290> way<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.560> I<00:00:29.740> like<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:30.130> measure<00:00:30.370> flour

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
you the way that I like to measure flour

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.770 
you the way that I like to measure flour
and<00:00:31.150> prepare<00:00:31.990> dough<00:00:32.290> made<00:00:32.590> from<00:00:32.800> scratch<00:00:33.780> have

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
and prepare dough made from scratch have

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.540 
and prepare dough made from scratch have
you<00:00:34.899> ever<00:00:34.989> mixed<00:00:35.320> dough<00:00:35.679> and<00:00:36.039> then<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.309> next

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
you ever mixed dough and then the next

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.979 
you ever mixed dough and then the next
time<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:36.850> make<00:00:36.999> it<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:37.239> seems<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.629> come<00:00:37.809> out<00:00:37.839> a

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
time you make it it seems to come out a

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.720 
time you make it it seems to come out a
little<00:00:38.260> bit<00:00:38.469> differently<00:00:38.920> well<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.609> can

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
little bit differently well you can

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.160 
little bit differently well you can
always<00:00:39.879> tweak<00:00:40.300> dough<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.539> little<00:00:40.839> bit<00:00:41.019> by

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
always tweak dough a little bit by

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.349 
always tweak dough a little bit by
adding<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.620> little<00:00:41.769> flour<00:00:42.100> if<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.940> need<00:00:43.120> more

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
adding a little flour if you need more

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.849 
adding a little flour if you need more
but<00:00:43.600> what<00:00:43.749> I<00:00:43.780> like<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.260> do<00:00:44.409> it's<00:00:44.620> how<00:00:44.800> you

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
but what I like to do it's how you

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.590 
but what I like to do it's how you
measure<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.519> flour<00:00:45.730> I<00:00:45.879> think<00:00:46.149> initially<00:00:46.359> that

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
measure the flour I think initially that

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.619 
measure the flour I think initially that
really<00:00:46.989> sort<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.679> gives<00:00:47.859> you<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:49.089> upper<00:00:49.210> hand

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
really sort of gives you the upper hand

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.649 
really sort of gives you the upper hand
so<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:51.399> rule<00:00:51.609> of<00:00:51.760> thumb<00:00:52.030> when<00:00:52.300> I'm<00:00:52.449> measuring

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
so my rule of thumb when I'm measuring

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.200 
so my rule of thumb when I'm measuring
flours<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.379> always<00:00:53.530> like<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.769> scoop<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:55.179> flour

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
flours I always like to scoop the flour

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.529 
flours I always like to scoop the flour
into<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.260> measuring<00:00:56.469> cup<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.940> if<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.179> plunge

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
into the measuring cup now if you plunge

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.979 
into the measuring cup now if you plunge
the<00:00:58.870> cup<00:00:59.129> into<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:01.059> flour<00:01:01.420> you're<00:01:01.780> going<00:01:01.929> to

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
the cup into the flour you're going to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.569 
the cup into the flour you're going to
get<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.139> different<00:01:02.649> amount<00:01:02.889> of<00:01:03.100> flour<00:01:03.309> in<00:01:03.489> the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
get a different amount of flour in the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.460 
get a different amount of flour in the
cup<00:01:03.760> each<00:01:03.999> time<00:01:04.300> because<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:05.110> know<00:01:05.199> you'll<00:01:05.350> be

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
cup each time because you know you'll be

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.110 
cup each time because you know you'll be
making<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.950> dense<00:01:06.190> you'll<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:06.550> packing<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:07.030> in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
making it dense you'll be packing it in

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.340 
making it dense you'll be packing it in
this<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.360> really<00:01:07.509> don't<00:01:07.719> want<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.899> pack<00:01:08.079> it<00:01:08.110> in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
this you really don't want to pack it in

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.679 
this you really don't want to pack it in
you<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.070> want<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.310> measure<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:10.060> split<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.540> in

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
you just want to measure it split it in

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.789 
you just want to measure it split it in
and<00:01:10.899> then<00:01:11.350> take<00:01:11.530> any<00:01:11.710> straightedge<00:01:12.250> knife<00:01:12.670> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and then take any straightedge knife and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.950 
and then take any straightedge knife and
just<00:01:16.740> level<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.829> off<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.299> that's<00:01:19.479> one<00:01:19.780> cup

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
just level it off then that's one cup

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.569 
just level it off then that's one cup
now<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.170> recipe<00:01:20.409> we're<00:01:20.829> doing<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.219> from<00:01:21.430> the

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
now the recipe we're doing is from the

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.920 
now the recipe we're doing is from the
book<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:21.939> it's<00:01:22.030> going<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.180> be<00:01:22.299> three<00:01:22.539> cups<00:01:22.780> of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
book so it's going to be three cups of

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.499 
book so it's going to be three cups of
flour<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:24.490> I'm<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:24.610> letting<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.090> sort<00:01:25.390> of

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
flour see I'm just letting it sort of

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.350 
flour see I'm just letting it sort of
fall<00:01:25.810> where<00:01:26.049> where<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.619> goes<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.759> then<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> sort

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
fall where where it goes and then I sort

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.649 
fall where where it goes and then I sort
of<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.630> level<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.110> off<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.329> two<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:34.539> then

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
of just level it off it's two and then

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.289 
of just level it off it's two and then
we'll<00:01:34.780> put<00:01:34.930> our<00:01:34.960> third<00:01:35.439> cup<00:01:35.799> so<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:36.430> think<00:01:37.090> if

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
we'll put our third cup so I think if

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.209 
we'll put our third cup so I think if
you<00:01:37.420> stick<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.899> this<00:01:38.049> if<00:01:38.469> you<00:01:38.710> measure<00:01:38.920> flour

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
you stick to this if you measure flour

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.560 
you stick to this if you measure flour
each<00:01:39.490> time<00:01:39.789> like<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.149> should<00:01:40.329> have<00:01:40.420> pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
each time like this should have pretty

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.889 
each time like this should have pretty
much<00:01:40.840> kept<00:01:41.289> consistent<00:01:42.180> results<00:01:43.180> but<00:01:43.780> by

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
much kept consistent results but by

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.080 
much kept consistent results but by
plunging<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.530> or<00:01:44.710> like<00:01:44.920> you<00:01:45.159> know<00:01:45.369> filling<00:01:45.939> it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
plunging it or like you know filling it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.819 
plunging it or like you know filling it
and<00:01:46.179> packing<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.899> there<00:01:47.079> I<00:01:47.289> think<00:01:47.679> each

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
and packing it in there I think each

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.999 
and packing it in there I think each
time<00:01:47.859> you'll<00:01:48.250> get<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.969> different<00:01:49.869> result<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
time you'll get a different result so

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.209 
time you'll get a different result so
that's<00:01:51.509> three<00:01:52.509> now<00:01:53.380> what<00:01:53.530> we've<00:01:53.679> done<00:01:53.829> is<00:01:54.070> I've

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
that's three now what we've done is I've

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.209 
that's three now what we've done is I've
already<00:01:54.759> put<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> yeast<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.770> lukewarm

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
already put the yeast in the lukewarm

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.800 
already put the yeast in the lukewarm
water<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:57.969> what<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.359> want<00:01:58.539> some

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
water and this is what you want some

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.340 
water and this is what you want some
toast

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
toast

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.249 
toast
it's<00:01:59.799> bubbled<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:00.429> nicely<00:02:00.969> enough<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
it's bubbled up nicely enough with the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.910 
it's bubbled up nicely enough with the
water<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.310> east<00:02:03.490> and

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
water and the east and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.440 
water and the east and
a<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.310> sugar<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:04.790> that's<00:02:04.970> actually

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
a bit of sugar so that's actually

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.749 
a bit of sugar so that's actually
perfect<00:02:06.080> we're<00:02:06.830> ready<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.159> use<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.640> what

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
perfect we're ready to use that so what
