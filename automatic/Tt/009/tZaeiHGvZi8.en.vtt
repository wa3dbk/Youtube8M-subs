00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.120 
about everything but after a while your
body<00:02:14.400> gets<00:02:15.400> into<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> certain<00:02:16.390> rhythm<00:02:16.570> which

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
body gets into a certain rhythm which

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.740 
body gets into a certain rhythm which
allows<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.490> drive<00:02:19.060> without<00:02:19.450> really

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750

allows you to just drive without really
thinking<00:02:19.840> all<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.400> same<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.640> with

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
thinking all right so the same is with

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.780 
thinking all right so the same is with
guitar<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:23.290> whole<00:02:23.860> idea<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
guitar so the whole idea of this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.490 
guitar so the whole idea of this
exercise<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.660> your<00:02:25.840> left<00:02:26.050> hand<00:02:26.320> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
exercise is to get your left hand and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.730 
exercise is to get your left hand and
your<00:02:26.650> right<00:02:26.680> hand<00:02:28.170> coordinating<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
your right hand coordinating so that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.110 
your right hand coordinating so that
they're<00:02:29.920> used<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> movement<00:02:30.880> all<00:02:31.000> right

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
they're used to the movement all right

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.380 
they're used to the movement all right
so<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.630> really<00:02:31.990> basic<00:02:32.730> strumming<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
so this is a really basic strumming and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
so this is a really basic strumming and
you<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.780> play<00:02:35.080> some<00:02:35.320> decent<00:02:35.680> songs<00:02:35.920> just

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
you can play some decent songs just

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.120 
you can play some decent songs just
using<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> symbol<00:02:37.540> downstroke<00:02:38.050> alright<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
using the symbol downstroke alright so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.440 
using the symbol downstroke alright so
don't<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:39.790> granted<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:40.150> think<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
alright so and as a beginner you really

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.940 
alright so and as a beginner you really
have<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.690> get<00:02:50.960> a<00:02:50.990> grasp<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> fundamentals

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
have to get a grasp of the fundamentals

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.150 
have to get a grasp of the fundamentals
of<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.150> practice<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.070> practice<00:02:55.070> this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
of this so practice this practice this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.220 
of this so practice this practice this
exercise<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:56.030> stop<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.420> know<00:02:56.540> come<00:02:56.870> on

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
exercise and just stop you know come on

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.680 
exercise and just stop you know come on
strong<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.740> counting<00:02:58.130> out<00:02:58.250> loud<00:02:58.280> one<00:02:59.150> two

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
strong and counting out loud one two

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.580 
strong and counting out loud one two
three<00:03:00.290> four<00:03:00.800> one<00:03:01.310> two<00:03:01.850> three<00:03:01.880> four<00:03:02.390> one<00:03:03.290> two

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
three four one two three four one two

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.240 
three four one two three four one two
three<00:03:04.190> four<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:06.140> then<00:03:06.200> stop<00:03:06.560> building<00:03:06.890> up<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
three four and then stop building up the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.800 
three four and then stop building up the
number<00:03:07.520> of<00:03:07.610> strokes<00:03:07.880> as<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.420> get<00:03:08.600> more

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
number of strokes as you get more

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.440 
number of strokes as you get more
confident<00:03:09.320> alright<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.330> the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
confident alright so that is for the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.060 
confident alright so that is for the
four<00:03:11.660> count<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.500> other<00:03:12.620> one<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:12.950> two

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
four count and the other one is two

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.550 
four count and the other one is two
three<00:03:13.280> count<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.210> one<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.840> same<00:03:15.140> you

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
three count so that one is the same you

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.050 
three count so that one is the same you
do<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.070> same<00:03:16.280> way<00:03:16.430> as<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.760> would<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
do it the same way as you would the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.820 
do it the same way as you would the
previous<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.810> basically<00:03:18.590> all<00:03:18.710> you're

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
previous one and basically all you're

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.050 
previous one and basically all you're
doing<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.130> instead<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.460> counting<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.730> four

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
doing is instead of counting the four

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.730 
doing is instead of counting the four
you<00:03:20.210> just<00:03:20.360> counting<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> three<00:03:21.020> so<00:03:21.650> you're

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
you just counting to three so you're

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:45.160 
you just counting to three so you're
going

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.480 

all<00:03:46.170> right<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.530> one's<00:03:46.740> a<00:03:46.830> bit<00:03:47.040> trickier

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
all right so this one's a bit trickier

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.480 
all right so this one's a bit trickier
than<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.700> fourth<00:03:48.030> one<00:03:48.210> because<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.080> goes<00:03:49.490> one

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
than the fourth one because it goes one

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.440 
than the fourth one because it goes one
two<00:03:50.520> three<00:03:51.420> one<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.460> two<00:03:53.460> three<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.420> two

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
two three one one two three one two

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.950 
two three one one two three one two
three<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.710> two<00:03:56.190> three<00:03:56.310> one<00:03:57.000> two<00:03:57.270> three

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
three one two three one two three

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.770 
three one two three one two three
don't<00:03:59.120> don't<00:04:00.300> dum-dum-dum<00:04:01.110> dum-dum-dum<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
don't don't dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.300 
don't don't dum-dum-dum dum-dum-dum and
this<00:04:04.440> would<00:04:04.590> take<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> little<00:04:05.040> bit<00:04:05.160> more

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
this would take a little bit more

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
this would take a little bit more
practice<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.060> once<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.110> rhythm

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
practice but once you can get the rhythm

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.850 
practice but once you can get the rhythm
of<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.990> would<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.380> really<00:04:10.620> help

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
of it it this would really really help

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.500 
of it it this would really really help
you<00:04:11.010> improve<00:04:11.640> your<00:04:11.700> your<00:04:12.240> strumming

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
you improve your your strumming

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.960 
you improve your your strumming
coordination<00:04:13.260> alright<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:13.890> starting<00:04:14.850> with

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
coordination alright so starting with

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.360 
coordination alright so starting with
one<00:04:15.420> two<00:04:15.870> three<00:04:19.609> build<00:04:20.609> up<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.970> one<00:04:21.959> two<00:04:22.590> three

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
one two three build up to one two three

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.840 
one two three build up to one two three
one<00:04:24.030> two

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.060 

three<00:04:27.390> one<00:04:28.110> two<00:04:28.680> three<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.930> big<00:04:30.930> one<00:04:31.230> on<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
three one two three one big one on the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.700 
three one two three one big one on the
on<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.610> next<00:04:32.880> quad<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.420> one<00:04:33.720> two<00:04:36.320> let's<00:04:37.320> switch

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
on the next quad so one two let's switch

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.560 
on the next quad so one two let's switch
courts<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:40.640> switch<00:04:41.640> parts<00:04:42.090> one<00:04:42.630> two<00:04:43.110> three

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
courts and switch parts one two three

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.490 
courts and switch parts one two three
four<00:04:45.570> one<00:04:46.320> two<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:48.090> once<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.840> feel<00:04:49.050> confident

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
four one two and once you feel confident

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.260 
four one two and once you feel confident
that<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.890> start<00:04:50.130> being<00:04:50.280> up<00:04:50.460> speed<00:04:50.730> then<00:04:51.180> you

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that you start being up speed then you

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:17.969 
that you start being up speed then you
can<00:04:51.510> segue

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.369 

once<00:05:18.979> you<00:05:19.129> can<00:05:19.449> once<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.539> used<00:05:20.779> to<00:05:20.930> though<00:05:21.080> the

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
once you can once you used to though the

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.989 
once you can once you used to though the
four<00:05:21.650> beat<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.069> three<00:05:22.370> beat<00:05:22.550> patterns

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:22.999 
four beat and the three beat patterns

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:24.760 
four beat and the three beat patterns
what<00:05:23.479> you<00:05:23.599> can<00:05:23.749> actually<00:05:23.900> do<00:05:24.199> is<00:05:24.319> instead<00:05:24.710> of

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
what you can actually do is instead of

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.800 
what you can actually do is instead of
just<00:05:24.830> playing<00:05:25.159> three<00:05:25.639> or<00:05:25.939> four<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.629> can

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
just playing three or four you can

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.580 
just playing three or four you can
actually<00:05:26.990> extend<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:27.830> multiples<00:05:28.819> of<00:05:28.939> eight

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
actually extend it to multiples of eight

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.469 
actually extend it to multiples of eight
like<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:30.680> you're<00:05:30.800> playing<00:05:30.830> for<00:05:31.310> bid<00:05:31.550> or<00:05:31.759> six<00:05:32.270> if

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
like if you're playing for bid or six if

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:44.490 
like if you're playing for bid or six if
you're<00:05:32.629> playing<00:05:32.810> like<00:05:33.110> 3b<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.219> be<00:05:34.430> like

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.980 

three

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.600 

which<00:05:50.990> actually<00:05:51.350> sounds<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:52.010> lot<00:05:52.100> better<00:05:52.160> it

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
which actually sounds a lot better it

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.870 
which actually sounds a lot better it
doesn't<00:05:53.000> sound<00:05:53.120> this<00:05:53.300> fastest

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.520 

all<00:06:01.880> right<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.300> same<00:06:02.510> goes<00:06:02.810> for<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:03.230> four

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
all right the same goes for the four

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.230 
all right the same goes for the four
four<00:06:04.010> bits<00:06:04.220> where<00:06:04.550> you<00:06:04.850> going

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:38.319 

you<00:06:10.240> can<00:06:10.389> actually<00:06:10.540> go<00:06:11.400> another<00:06:12.400> bottle<00:06:12.820> on<00:06:12.910> go

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:38.329 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:43.009 

all<00:06:39.329> right<00:06:39.919> so<00:06:40.919> okay<00:06:41.519> with<00:06:42.209> that

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:43.019 
all right so okay with that
