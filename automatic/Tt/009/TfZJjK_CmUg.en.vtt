the<00:00:44.470> case<00:00:44.589> in<00:00:44.769> this<00:00:44.890> one<00:00:45.070> as<00:00:45.190> well<00:00:45.370> and

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
the case in this one as well and

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.579 
the case in this one as well and
basically<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.839> whole<00:00:46.930> struggle<00:00:47.199> in<00:00:47.500> the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
basically the whole struggle in the

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.170 
basically the whole struggle in the
story<00:00:47.860> centers<00:00:48.100> around<00:00:48.280> four<00:00:48.670> elemental

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
story centers around four elemental

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.960 
story centers around four elemental
masks<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:50.160> basically<00:00:51.160> crash<00:00:51.460> wants<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.850> get

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
masks and basically crash wants to get

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.210 
masks and basically crash wants to get
the<00:00:52.059> masks<00:00:52.449> before<00:00:52.800> cortex<00:00:53.800> can<00:00:53.980> get<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
the masks before cortex can get the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.670 
the masks before cortex can get the
masks<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.930> animate<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.960> creature<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:56.500> he's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
masks to animate a creature that he's

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.560 
masks to animate a creature that he's
created<00:00:56.890> called<00:00:57.160> crunch<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:58.180> basically<00:00:58.449> that

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
created called crunch so basically that

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.880 
created called crunch so basically that
as<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.050> go<00:00:59.260> through<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.530> game<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.829> you

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
as you go through the game and you

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.430 
as you go through the game and you
defeat<00:01:00.160> bosses<00:01:00.610> yield<00:01:00.940> you'll<00:01:01.300> defeat<00:01:02.260> or

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
defeat bosses yield you'll defeat or

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.380 
defeat bosses yield you'll defeat or
destroy<00:01:02.859> one<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.160> the<00:01:03.309> elemental<00:01:03.760> masks<00:01:04.210> and

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
destroy one of the elemental masks and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.090 
destroy one of the elemental masks and
that's<00:01:04.809> basically<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.199> whole<00:01:05.440> premise<00:01:05.800> it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
that's basically the whole premise it

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.400 
that's basically the whole premise it
drives<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.729> game<00:01:06.970> as<00:01:07.720> far<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.080> gameplay

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
drives the game as far as the gameplay

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.410 
drives the game as far as the gameplay
is<00:01:08.530> concerned<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.430> wrath<00:01:09.550> of<00:01:09.700> cortex<00:01:09.910> is<00:01:10.240> just

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
is concerned the wrath of cortex is just

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.060 
is concerned the wrath of cortex is just
like<00:01:10.539> every<00:01:11.050> other<00:01:11.080> Crash<00:01:11.470> Bandicoot<00:01:11.500> game

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
like every other Crash Bandicoot game

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.800 
like every other Crash Bandicoot game
before<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.970> what<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> mean<00:01:13.270> by<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.450> is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
before it and what I mean by that is

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510 
before it and what I mean by that is
that<00:01:13.840> instead<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.770> being<00:01:15.009> a<00:01:15.100> free-roaming

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
that instead of being a free-roaming

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.980 
that instead of being a free-roaming
game<00:01:15.880> where<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:16.360> wherever<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.660> want

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
game where you can go wherever you want

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.200 
game where you can go wherever you want
basically<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.860> play<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.190> game<00:01:18.280> on<00:01:18.460> Rails<00:01:18.759> so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
basically you play the game on Rails so

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.359 
basically you play the game on Rails so
you<00:01:19.300> have<00:01:19.570> let's<00:01:20.200> say<00:01:20.320> an<00:01:20.410> imaginary<00:01:20.890> tunnel

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
you have let's say an imaginary tunnel

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.620 
you have let's say an imaginary tunnel
that<00:01:21.460> you're<00:01:21.610> forced<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.119> go<00:01:22.240> down<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.539> you're

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
that you're forced to go down and you're

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.850 
that you're forced to go down and you're

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
always forced to go in that one

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.560 
always forced to go in that one
direction<00:01:24.039> now<00:01:24.880> granted<00:01:25.210> there<00:01:25.360> are<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.450> couple

you also get to quit control cocoa which
is<00:01:50.380> his<00:01:50.530> sister<00:01:50.800> now<00:01:51.520> crashes<00:01:52.060> levels<00:01:52.390> are

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
is his sister now crashes levels are

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.660 
is his sister now crashes levels are
typical<00:01:53.440> crash<00:01:53.739> fair<00:01:54.069> basically<00:01:54.489> you<00:01:54.580> have

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
typical crash fair basically you have

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.180 
typical crash fair basically you have
your<00:01:54.789> spin<00:01:55.090> yet<00:01:55.330> your<00:01:55.450> jump<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.190> basically

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
your spin yet your jump and basically

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.770 
your spin yet your jump and basically
the<00:01:57.340> whole<00:01:57.459> game<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:57.940> laid<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.179> as<00:01:58.450> far<00:01:58.660> as

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
the whole game is laid out as far as

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.510 
the whole game is laid out as far as
like<00:01:58.959> how<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.259> proceed<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.069> trial<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
like how you proceed is the trial and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.580 
like how you proceed is the trial and
error<00:02:00.759> system<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:01.899> basically<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.319> come

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
error system so basically you come

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.800 
error system so basically you come
through<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:03.250> know<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.369> set<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.970> portion<00:02:04.750> of

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
through you know a set of the portion of

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.479 
through you know a set of the portion of
the<00:02:04.869> level<00:02:05.289> you'll<00:02:05.890> figure<00:02:06.069> out<00:02:06.160> how<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.369> get

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
the level you'll figure out how to get

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
the level you'll figure out how to get
through<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.700> you'll<00:02:06.910> get<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.179> one<00:02:07.360> enemy

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
through it you'll get to this one enemy

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.180 
through it you'll get to this one enemy
who<00:02:07.750> will<00:02:07.869> kill<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.259> soon<00:02:08.739> as<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.920> die<00:02:09.129> you

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
who will kill you soon as you die you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.350 
who will kill you soon as you die you
realize<00:02:09.759> how<00:02:09.879> you're<00:02:10.000> supposed<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.209> get

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
realize how you're supposed to get

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.850 
realize how you're supposed to get
through<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.569> next<00:02:11.319> time<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.590> go<00:02:11.709> through

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
through it next time you go through

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
through it next time you go through
level<00:02:12.190> you'll<00:02:12.580> make<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.849> through<00:02:12.879> that<00:02:13.090> enemy

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
level you'll make it through that enemy

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.610 
level you'll make it through that enemy
and<00:02:13.599> then<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.810> come<00:02:13.930> up<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.020> another<00:02:14.349> hard

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and then you come up to another hard

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.800 
and then you come up to another hard
enemy<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.069> you'll<00:02:15.280> die<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.790> hard<00:02:16.390> platform

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
jump and you'll die and then you have to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.860 
jump and you'll die and then you have to
go<00:02:18.670> back<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.120> go<00:02:19.239> through<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.690> things

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
go back you go through all the things

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.089 
go back you go through all the things
that<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.110> learn<00:02:20.230> before<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.010> get

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
that you learn before and then you get

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.979 
that you learn before and then you get
past<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.459> one<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.270> basically<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.720> trial

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
past that one and basically that trial

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.570 
past that one and basically that trial
and<00:02:23.110> error<00:02:23.230> gameplay<00:02:23.650> which<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.099> present<00:02:24.520> in

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
and error gameplay which was present in

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.130 
and error gameplay which was present in
all<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> previous<00:02:25.000> crash<00:02:25.360> games<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.900> also

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
all the previous crash games is also

present in this one and to be honest

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.850 
present in this one and to be honest
with<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.879> starting<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.390> get<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> bit<00:02:28.660> old<00:02:28.930> as

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
with you is starting to get a bit old as

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.199 
with you is starting to get a bit old as
far<00:02:30.099> as<00:02:30.129> cocos<00:02:30.520> levels<00:02:30.819> are<00:02:30.910> concerned

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
far as cocos levels are concerned

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.069 
far as cocos levels are concerned
they're<00:02:31.360> definitely<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.780> lot<00:02:31.900> more

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
they're definitely a lot more

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.539 
they're definitely a lot more
straightforward<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.799> far<00:02:32.950> as<00:02:33.040> platforming

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
straightforward as far as platforming

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.280 
straightforward as far as platforming
games<00:02:33.790> go<00:02:34.030> basically<00:02:34.510> you're<00:02:34.780> doing<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.109> lot

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
games go basically you're doing a lot

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.020 
games go basically you're doing a lot
less<00:02:35.620> attacking<00:02:36.189> and<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.730> lot

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
less attacking and a lot

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.120 
less attacking and a lot
more<00:02:37.120> jumping<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.500> top<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
more jumping and on top of it all the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.860 
more jumping and on top of it all the
camera<00:02:39.459> also<00:02:39.700> makes<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.120> game<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.270> lot<00:02:40.569> harder

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
camera also makes a game a lot harder

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.540 
camera also makes a game a lot harder
than<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.140> should<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.560> there<00:02:42.100> are<00:02:42.190> many<00:02:42.310> times

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
than it should be there are many times

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.250 
than it should be there are many times
we<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> very<00:02:43.240> simple<00:02:43.600> platform<00:02:44.080> jump

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
we have a very simple platform jump

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.750 
we have a very simple platform jump
you're<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.590> jumping<00:02:44.740> from<00:02:45.100> one<00:02:45.250> platform<00:02:45.490> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
you're just jumping from one platform to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.970 
you're just jumping from one platform to
the<00:02:45.880> next<00:02:46.360> because<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.200> camera<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.650> kind<00:02:47.860> of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the next because the camera is kind of

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.100 
the next because the camera is kind of
off<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.400> cockeyed<00:02:48.819> view<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.660> maybe<00:02:49.930> there's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
off in a cockeyed view and maybe there's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.870 
off in a cockeyed view and maybe there's
a<00:02:50.200> pole<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.830> front<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.280> obscuring

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
a pole in front of it just obscuring

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
a pole in front of it just obscuring
your<00:02:51.910> view<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.300> can't<00:02:52.480> see<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.720> makes

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
your view that you can't see that makes

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.660 
your view that you can't see that makes
it<00:02:52.959> impossible<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.650> make<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> jump<00:02:54.280> without

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it impossible to make the jump without

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.780 
it impossible to make the jump without
dying<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.209> few<00:02:55.360> times<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.720> experimenting<00:02:56.380> so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
dying a few times and experimenting so

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.430 
dying a few times and experimenting so
like<00:02:57.790> pass<00:02:58.060> crash<00:02:58.420> games<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.959> whole<00:02:59.110> game<00:02:59.319> of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
centers around trial and error and it

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.479 
centers around trial and error and it
may<00:03:01.780> have<00:03:01.900> been<00:03:02.020> okay<00:03:02.380> back<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.709> 1998<00:03:03.280> when<00:03:03.400> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
may have been okay back in 1998 when the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.680 
may have been okay back in 1998 when the
franchise<00:03:03.850> de<00:03:04.030> beauté<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.420> they<00:03:04.480> were<00:03:04.600> just

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
franchise de beauté and they were just

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.090 
franchise de beauté and they were just
kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.959> getting<00:03:05.110> their<00:03:05.260> heads<00:03:05.470> around<00:03:05.590> 3d

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
kind of getting their heads around 3d

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.699 
kind of getting their heads around 3d
but<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:07.090> really<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.900> inacceptable<00:03:08.350> and

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
but now really this is inacceptable and

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.530 
but now really this is inacceptable and
hopefully<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.760> next<00:03:09.880> crash<00:03:10.300> game

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
hopefully for the next crash game

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.820 
hopefully for the next crash game
they'll<00:03:10.750> actually<00:03:10.900> work<00:03:11.170> around<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
they'll actually work around this and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.070 
they'll actually work around this and
bring<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.700> series<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.480> rest<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
bring the series up to the rest of the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.320 
bring the series up to the rest of the
games<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.320> its<00:03:14.500> genre<00:03:14.709> as<00:03:15.700> far<00:03:15.850> as<00:03:15.940> graphics

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
games in its genre as far as graphics

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.810 
games in its genre as far as graphics
are<00:03:16.480> concerned<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:18.010> kind<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.280> crazy<00:03:18.459> because

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
are concerned it's kind of crazy because

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.880 
are concerned it's kind of crazy because
when<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.209> look<00:03:19.390> at<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> xbox<00:03:20.080> version<00:03:20.440> of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
when you look at the xbox version of

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.160 
when you look at the xbox version of
Crash<00:03:21.130> Bandicoot<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:22.269> wrath<00:03:22.420> of<00:03:22.569> cortex<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
Crash Bandicoot the wrath of cortex and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.270 
Crash Bandicoot the wrath of cortex and
then<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.350> look<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.650> PlayStation<00:03:23.860> 2

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
then you look at the PlayStation 2

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.550 
then you look at the PlayStation 2
version<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.819> virtually<00:03:25.690> impossible<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.410> tell

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
version is virtually impossible to tell

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.140 
version is virtually impossible to tell
the<00:03:26.590> difference<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:27.100> fact<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.459> don't<00:03:27.880> know<00:03:28.000> that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
the difference in fact I don't know that

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.759 
the difference in fact I don't know that
I<00:03:28.180> would<00:03:28.360> be<00:03:28.480> able<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.050> play<00:03:29.260> both<00:03:29.530> games

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
I would be able to and I play both games

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.340 
I would be able to and I play both games
at<00:03:30.040> length<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:31.180> basically<00:03:31.810> along<00:03:32.140> with<00:03:32.260> that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
at length so basically along with that

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.900 
at length so basically along with that
comes<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.680> good<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.280> bad<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.850> good

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
comes the good and the bad and the good

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.540 
comes the good and the bad and the good
is<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.480> crash<00:03:35.019> looks<00:03:35.260> great<00:03:35.530> definitely<00:03:36.459> the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
is that crash looks great definitely the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.770 
is that crash looks great definitely the
best<00:03:36.700> he's<00:03:36.910> ever<00:03:36.970> looked<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:37.390> any<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.660> his

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
best he's ever looked in any of his

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
best he's ever looked in any of his
games<00:03:38.019> his<00:03:38.680> curves<00:03:38.950> are<00:03:39.100> nice<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.430> flowing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
games his curves are nice and flowing

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.940 
games his curves are nice and flowing
his<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.300> animation<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.870> nice<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.260> smooth<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
his the animation is nice and smooth and

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.620 
his the animation is nice and smooth and
he<00:03:42.100> he's<00:03:42.549> caught<00:03:42.760> he<00:03:42.910> comes<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.209> life<00:03:43.360> in<00:03:43.510> this

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
he he's caught he comes to life in this

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.000 
he he's caught he comes to life in this
game<00:03:43.810> more<00:03:43.989> than<00:03:44.019> any<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.470> his<00:03:44.500> games<00:03:44.739> before

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
game more than any of his games before

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.280 
game more than any of his games before
this<00:03:45.340> one<00:03:45.549> but<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> negative<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.079> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
this one but the negative is that the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.509 
this one but the negative is that the
game<00:03:47.470> was<00:03:47.560> originally<00:03:47.709> designed<00:03:48.190> for<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
game was originally designed for the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.819 
game was originally designed for the
PlayStation<00:03:49.030> 2<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> lot<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.380> enemies<00:03:50.709> in

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
PlayStation 2 so a lot of the enemies in

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.259 
PlayStation 2 so a lot of the enemies in
the<00:03:50.920> environments<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.489> kind<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.700> low<00:03:51.940> poly

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
the environments are kind of low poly

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.509 
the environments are kind of low poly
there<00:03:53.019> are<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.260> really<00:03:53.500> fleshed<00:03:53.890> out<00:03:54.130> there

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
there are not really fleshed out there

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.310 
there are not really fleshed out there
kind<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.700> crude<00:03:55.000> looking<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
kind of crude looking and the the

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.229 
kind of crude looking and the the
textures<00:03:56.709> are<00:03:56.860> flatly<00:03:57.250> shaded<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.910> granted

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
textures are flatly shaded and granted

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.520 
textures are flatly shaded and granted
that<00:03:58.360> does<00:03:58.540> give<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> kind<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.170> cartoon

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
that does give it kind of that cartoon

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.590 
that does give it kind of that cartoon
look<00:03:59.829> now<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.640> PlayStation<00:04:01.150> 2<00:04:01.269> version<00:04:01.299> of

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
look now the PlayStation 2 version of

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.330 
look now the PlayStation 2 version of
the<00:04:01.660> game<00:04:01.750> wasn't<00:04:01.959> exactly<00:04:02.260> ugly<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:02.980> did<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.310> a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
the game wasn't exactly ugly it did do a

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.560 
the game wasn't exactly ugly it did do a
lot<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.579> things<00:04:03.820> well<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.209> had<00:04:04.329> nice

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
lot of things well it had nice

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.599 
lot of things well it had nice
reflections<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.590> had<00:04:05.739> nice<00:04:05.950> environmental

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
reflections it had nice environmental

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.729 
reflections it had nice environmental
mapping<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.510> had<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> nice<00:04:07.810> particle<00:04:08.350> effects

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
mapping it had a nice particle effects

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.770 
mapping it had a nice particle effects
and<00:04:09.070> even<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.640> physics<00:04:09.970> system<00:04:10.269> for<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.630> game

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and even the physics system for the game

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.470 
and even the physics system for the game
was<00:04:10.930> pretty<00:04:11.049> decent<00:04:11.620> but<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.640> an<00:04:12.730> xbox<00:04:13.030> game

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
was pretty decent but for an xbox game

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.259 
was pretty decent but for an xbox game
it<00:04:14.109> definitely<00:04:14.590> falls<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.250> little<00:04:15.489> short<00:04:15.640> of

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
it definitely falls a little short of

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.460 
it definitely falls a little short of
average<00:04:16.750> or<00:04:16.870> maybe<00:04:17.019> just<00:04:17.079> right<00:04:17.350> around

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
average or maybe just right around

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.259 
average or maybe just right around
average<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.549> has<00:04:18.700> all<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:18.970> things<00:04:19.209> that

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
average it has all the things that

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.880 
average it has all the things that
PlayStation<00:04:19.750> 2<00:04:19.870> version<00:04:19.900> has<00:04:20.289> but<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.799> has

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
PlayStation 2 version has but it has

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.710 
PlayStation 2 version has but it has
nothing<00:04:21.100> extra<00:04:21.700> so<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:22.419> you're<00:04:22.539> kind<00:04:22.690> of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
nothing extra so if you're kind of

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.960 
nothing extra so if you're kind of
deciding<00:04:23.200> between<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.560> two<00:04:23.710> games<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.610> you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
deciding between the two games and you

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.000 
deciding between the two games and you
have<00:04:25.210> crash<00:04:25.900> for<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.169> Xbox<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.919> have

crashed for the ps2 in the bargain bin

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.420 
crashed for the ps2 in the bargain bin
definitely<00:04:29.260> pick<00:04:29.410> up<00:04:29.500> crash<00:04:29.710> for<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:29.979> ps2<00:04:30.250> in

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
definitely pick up crash for the ps2 in

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.650 
definitely pick up crash for the ps2 in
the<00:04:30.490> bargain<00:04:30.850> bin<00:04:30.880> because<00:04:31.330> there's<00:04:31.479> really

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
the bargain bin because there's really

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.080 
the bargain bin because there's really
no<00:04:31.870> difference<00:04:31.900> between<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.560> two<00:04:32.680> games<00:04:33.090> if
