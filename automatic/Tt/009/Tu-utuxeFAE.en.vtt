I'm starting to review some of these

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm starting to review some of these
maps<00:00:38.180> I'd<00:00:39.180> probably<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> anyways<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
maps I'd probably do it anyways but I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860 
maps I'd probably do it anyways but I
know<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.370> guess<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:42.329> supposed<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> be

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
know and I guess this supposed to be

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.819 
know and I guess this supposed to be
like<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> back<00:00:43.379> path<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:45.829> yeah

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like the back path thing they take yeah

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.979 
like the back path thing they take yeah
yeah<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:48.030> wouldn't<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.050> honest<00:00:50.989> my

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
yeah I wouldn't know to be honest my

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.639 
yeah I wouldn't know to be honest my
memory<00:00:52.350> no<00:00:53.870> not<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> best<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.320> stuff

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
memory no not the best with that stuff

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:07.640 
memory no not the best with that stuff
so<00:01:03.110> okay<00:01:04.309> just<00:01:05.750> does<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> religious<00:01:07.320> thing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
so okay just does a religious thing

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.880 
so okay just does a religious thing
whenever<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> volume<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.619> guess

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
whenever and the volume up so I guess
