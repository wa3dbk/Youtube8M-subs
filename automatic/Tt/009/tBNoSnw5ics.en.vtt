00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello guys and girls finally another 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 video here in vitonic before anything 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.090
 I want to thank you for following me 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.460
 here on youtube I am your German coach 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 favorite that the hoop is in this channel 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 you're not going to see all the garbage that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 you better see on the web I do not know what you 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.260
 they want to sell supplements or the pill 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 magic for your problems or to win 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 muscle mass is simply not there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 the videos here that I do will always have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.359
 the best resources 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 based on science this is very 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.449
 important to me personally in this 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.399
 video I want to talk about a very subject 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 important related to training 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.640
 but what is a routine today I want to talk 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.620
 of two very important topics 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.190
 directly related to your success in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 the gym first determination and second 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 persistence at the beginning this is a no 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 I know very boring but what I see day to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 day 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.000
 in the gym they are not always the same 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.559
 faces in reverse I always see people 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.340
 different sure that you too 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.410
 you know at the beginning of the year the gym is 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 full of people but two or three weeks 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 afterwards you do not see anyone of the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.230
 first days the reason is simple the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.070
 people 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.000
 does not pursue its goals constantly with 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.100
 determination so the factor number 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.010
 one for exit energy in my opinion is 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.200
 persistence you should just go no 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.330
 excuses working with my clients there 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.790
 only so much that I can teach you 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.950
 they must put the effort and the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.650
 work do not buy supplements no 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.720
 buy another tutorial ebook or book that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.150
 they teach you new techniques or something 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.110
 different simply go to the easy gym 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.030

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.400

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.190
 determination to achieve your goals 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.230
 constantly number one get yourself a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.750
 partner or responsibility partner 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.460
 someone who has the same goals as 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
 had someone in the gym to follow you 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.440
 go ahead with someone who will pick you up 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.600
 when you fall on someone who screams for 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.710
 that you can give the last network that you 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.410

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 reminding you of your commitment to go to 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.459
 gym day to day number two to have goals 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.990
 clear 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.360
 I have a notebook with my goals 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.860
 x kilograms in three months or I want 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.020
 lose five kilograms in two months 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 these are concrete goals and the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.240
 you need to succeed do not say today 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 because I want a weight loss is not 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.680
 enough write the goals on a sheet 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.020
 and hang fabric in an area always in your 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.210
 where you work where you sleep is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.520
 where you live in all the places this you 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.120
 helps you focus on your goals and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.370
 reach them number 3 celebrate your successes 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.370
 regularly it is super important 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 celebrate what you have achieved but 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 celebrates its achievements because to achieve them in 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.850
 first place does not make sense gives you 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.270
 same if you buy something nice you're not going to 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.290
 have a good dinner with your boyfriend or girlfriend 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.990
 Number 4 does not document your progress this 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.910
 type because it is related a bit with 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.680
 the number 2 to maintain the motivation 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.170
 to go to the gym for years 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.200
 you need to document your progress not 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.960
 it matters how you do it with pencil and paper 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.600
 an iphone application or on a table 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.780
 of excel but the tool that you used 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.740
 must allow to see the progress 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.380
 constantly and regularly 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.810
