00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.910
 Welcome to the first meeting of the 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.980
 group list in the combat against load to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.449
 sharp car that will not serve as an entrance 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.400
 of the new bands I have the others 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.050
 on off we will discuss the strategy for 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.520
 the normal and heroic modes of this 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.930
 I will meet and we will see all your 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.359
 skills to defeat him more 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.859
 easily combat against load 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.869
 will have a place in a sand of the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.000
 city works where we will have to deal 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.339
 with this orc war chief and the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.320
 crowd of the stands we will begin 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.780
 with the position of the band as soon as 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.180
 let's start the fight the tanks place 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.090
 a load in the middle and the band should 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.800
 spread around the whole arena 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.660
 separated from each other the reason 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.120
 main of this is because of the skill 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.949
 called leaf dance what will make 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.020
 charge random players every little 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.570
 time hurting everyone who is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.039
 7 meters find another target 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.170
 point of the position of the band that 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.660
 we should keep in mind are the moats 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.339
 of the beasts a gate that will open and 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.860
 if we fall into it we will be devoured 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.210
 also throughout the fight also 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.490
 we must take into account the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.110
 called pillars of fire that as we see 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.759
 they are represented by four 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.460
 skulls around the center of the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.570
 sand these pillars of fire will rise 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.940
 throughout the combat of form 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.549
 random and we should avoid being inside 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.680
 of your damage zone will explain the position 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.619
 of the band we will go to the fight itself 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.330
 starting with the tanks load alone 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.970
 it will make a really annoying skill 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.740
 for the tanks called impaling what 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.600
 will make it in sarthe to the main tank and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.210
 inflicts a large amount of damage 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.950
 every second for eight seconds if 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.180
 we survived that of course 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.979
 we will have to do it 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.600
 the tank receive a damage of the year 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.729
 increased from next to stop during 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.070
 two minutes a moment that we will use to 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.660
 change of tank we continue with the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.050
 combat with the function of the band in 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.700
 general charge every so often fix to 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.250
 a player or random with the skill 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.009
 called rabid charge what will make you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.090
 move without stopping to your goal 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.330
 damaging everything that crosses its 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.060
 path obviously no one should cross 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.970
 or go ahead and suffer much 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.640
 damage your movement speed and damage 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.650
 done will increase every two seconds of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.470
 cumulative form so we shall 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.750
 be very careful the only way to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.800
 interrupt this rabid charge is the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.960
 following 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.570
 load must hit a pillar 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.790
 of active fire what will destroy it and 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.470
 will calm to load returning to the center of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.750
 the room with the tank that you had in 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.720
 that moment is crucial to do well 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 cargo must not accumulate many brands of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.340
 rabid charge or it will go so fast that by 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.680
 where it happens will also devastate the player 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 which is fixed by this skill should 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.640
 be careful not to spend it uselessly 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.940
 by means of the other companions of 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 band or it will kill us in addition charges should 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.110
 really hit the pillar of fire or 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.510
 will pass by without making any effect 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.160
 in it we continue with the other events of the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.380
 combat that the band should know that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.330
 will come from the sand bleachers the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.950
 first it's the bruising beer that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.930
 will throw us throws us drunk bile 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.790
 from the stands and that will form some 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 green channels of damage that we will have 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.600
 time to dodge and not step on and the 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.220
 second are the bombs of the horde of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.900
 iron that will hit players 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 randomly leaving them harm in the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.890
 time easily assumable by the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.330
 senators and since we talk about the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.160
 tiers let's go to the last skill 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.800
 main load called the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.510
 chain launch loaded along 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.380
 of the fight in return on the ground with 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.840
 curtis we will leave 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.360
 orders a few meters back moments 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.190
 then load will be chained to the five 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.840
 players closest to him and the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.610
 will throw up the stands 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.320
 This group should be formed by a 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.450
 tank if possible in which he has received 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.880
 impaling the damage so that gives 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.460
 time until three fish disappear and 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.960
 a healer obviously the players I 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.640
 they should wait a little bit for 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.410
 link those five players to 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.990
 approaching it is possible that you throw them 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.060
 they once thrown in the stands 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.700
 our mission will be to eliminate the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.650
 as many enemies as possible 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.830
 the time that we will have to carry out 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.560
 this task will be 45 seconds or until 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.330
 that a player reaches 30% of life what 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.970
 that will cause him to be expelled from the stands 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.560
 automatically in the stands we 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.020
 we will find three types of enemies 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.239
 he throws them drunken viles 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.400
 bombers of the iron horde and the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.350
 brutes of the iron horde our 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.570
 mission is to end all the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.400
 launches vile drunks and bombers of 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.040
 the iron horde before finishing the 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.900
 time since their actions will reverberate 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.300
 in the sand as we discussed with 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.770
 zones of damage and damage over time in 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.389
 random players 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.360
 the tank will grab them and they will leave 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.580
 killing do not have much life but every 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.889
 one makes special abilities the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.560
 throws vile drunks will make vile breath 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.090
 a frontal breath that will take damage 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.009
 the bombers of the iron horde 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.169
 they will leave fire bombs with a 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.479
 timer of a few seconds of the 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.400
 that we must separate ourselves and the fruits of 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.069
 the iron horde would only slow us down 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.900
 have passed the time they will throw us out of 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.240
 new to the arena and we will continue the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.610
 combat 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.410
 summarizing everything a bit basically this 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.229
 combat will be based on doing correctly 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.729
 the tank changes in each word 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.620
 managed to interrupt the rabid charge 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.360
 against the pillar of fire and be 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.729
 separated to avoid the dance of leaves 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.310
 zone of fire pillar damage and so on 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.380
 the use of heroism or bloodlust what 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.120
 we will do nothing else start the fight already 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.460
 that we will not have a special phase or 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.660
 impoverishment or anything like that so 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.699
 it will be when we most take advantage of it 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.139
 hopefully you have found it helpful 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.270
 this guide on the first meeting of 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.650
 propolis against load to sharp face and 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.900
 see you in the next guide the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.669
 butcher to be aware of them 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.380
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.539
 Any doubt about the combat do not hesitate 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.780
 in comment a greeting and luck in this 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.780
 band
