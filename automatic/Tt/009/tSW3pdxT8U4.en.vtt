00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
that in that it has got a bigger sensor

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.890 
that in that it has got a bigger sensor
than<00:00:53.650> most<00:00:53.830> cameras<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:55.150> that<00:00:55.180> if<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.630> time

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
than most cameras so that if I have time

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.710 
than most cameras so that if I have time
I<00:00:56.260> can<00:00:56.350> sit<00:00:56.800> down<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.160> be<00:00:57.280> quite<00:00:57.490> measured<00:00:57.940> get

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
I can sit down and be quite measured get

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.300 
I can sit down and be quite measured get
quite<00:00:58.990> noise<00:00:59.230> chela<00:00:59.470> depth<00:00:59.680> of<00:00:59.829> field<00:01:00.070> but

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
quite noise chela depth of field but

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.010 
quite noise chela depth of field but
similarly<00:01:00.880> if<00:01:01.060> something<00:01:01.540> is<00:01:01.630> happening

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
similarly if something is happening

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.840 
similarly if something is happening
that's<00:01:02.170> very<00:01:02.440> kinetic<00:01:02.740> it's<00:01:03.220> unrepeatable

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
that's very kinetic it's unrepeatable

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.930 
that's very kinetic it's unrepeatable
where<00:01:04.720> i'm<00:01:04.930> having<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.409> not<00:01:06.370> only<00:01:06.490> watch<00:01:06.700> my

personal safety then it's a very

personal safety then it's a very
ergonomic<00:01:11.800> camera<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> 200<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:12.970> can

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
switch it to automatic functions if I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.950 
switch it to automatic functions if I
need<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.670> one<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.420> things<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:16.630> really<00:01:16.659> liked

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
very moment when a jet flew overhead

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.679 
very moment when a jet flew overhead
which<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:01.039> terrifying<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.880> provided

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
which was terrifying and that provided

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.649 
which was terrifying and that provided
an<00:02:03.259> incredible<00:02:03.880> starting<00:02:04.880> point<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.539> of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
an incredible starting point for one of

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.789 
an incredible starting point for one of
the<00:02:05.750> most<00:02:05.929> dramatic<00:02:06.079> scenes<00:02:06.590> I've<00:02:06.770> ever

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the most dramatic scenes I've ever

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.160 
the most dramatic scenes I've ever
filmed<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.460> was<00:02:08.330> getting<00:02:08.569> ready<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.929> off<00:02:09.019> and

filmed I was getting ready to go off and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.540 
filmed I was getting ready to go off and
do<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:09.319> serial<00:02:09.830> film<00:02:10.009> which<00:02:10.160> was<00:02:10.340> kind<00:02:10.519> of

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
do this serial film which was kind of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.250 
do this serial film which was kind of
five<00:02:10.819> weeks<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.480> quite<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> difficult

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
five weeks in quite a difficult

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.100 
five weeks in quite a difficult
environment<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.180> needed<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.540> pretty<00:02:14.930> solid

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
environment and I needed a pretty solid

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
environment and I needed a pretty solid
camera<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.590> did<00:02:15.739> have<00:02:15.890> another<00:02:16.190> another<00:02:16.880> pretty

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
camera I did have another another pretty

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.809 
camera I did have another another pretty
well-known<00:02:17.599> camera<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.920> when<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> 200<00:02:19.730> was

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
well-known camera but when the 200 was

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.490 
well-known camera but when the 200 was
announced<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.360> had<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.900> other<00:02:21.049> camera<00:02:21.410> on

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
announced I had that other camera on

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.559 
announced I had that other camera on
eBay<00:02:21.830> within<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.370> three<00:02:22.640> hours<00:02:22.790> simply

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
eBay within about three hours simply

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.930 
eBay within about three hours simply
because<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.200> was<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.590> gonna<00:02:24.709> give<00:02:24.950> me<00:02:25.160> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
because it was just gonna give me just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940 
because it was just gonna give me just
that<00:02:26.120> bit<00:02:26.330> more<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.290> needed<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.799> was<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
that bit more that I needed it was a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.039 
that bit more that I needed it was a
slightly<00:02:28.250> bigger<00:02:28.549> sensor<00:02:29.090> which<00:02:29.510> not<00:02:29.840> only

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
slightly bigger sensor which not only

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.690 
slightly bigger sensor which not only
men<00:02:30.200> better<00:02:30.709> shallow<00:02:31.069> depth-of-field

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
men better shallow depth-of-field

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.610 
men better shallow depth-of-field
if<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:31.970> wanted<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.900> operates<00:02:33.140> much

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
if I wanted it but it operates much

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.229 
if I wanted it but it operates much
better<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.220> low<00:02:34.340> light<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.730> mean<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:34.970> good<00:02:35.120> in

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
better in low light I mean it's good in

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.610 
better in low light I mean it's good in
low-light<00:02:35.569> there<00:02:35.810> was<00:02:35.900> there<00:02:36.110> are<00:02:36.170> two<00:02:36.319> scenes

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
low-light there was there are two scenes

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.319 
low-light there was there are two scenes
in<00:02:36.829> particular<00:02:37.099> in<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.489> Syria<00:02:37.790> film<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.090> really

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
in particular in the Syria film I really

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.720 
in particular in the Syria film I really
wouldn't<00:02:38.599> have<00:02:38.630> got<00:02:39.160> without<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.370> slightly

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
wouldn't have got without that slightly

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.880 
wouldn't have got without that slightly
bigger<00:02:40.940> sensor<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.989> it<00:02:42.079> just<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.530> lighter

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
bigger sensor and it just it's lighter

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.250 
bigger sensor and it just it's lighter
and<00:02:43.310> it's<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:43.790> robust<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.660> really<00:02:44.930> felt

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
and it's more robust so it really felt

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.470 
and it's more robust so it really felt
like<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.069> right<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.579> get<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.299> thing

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
like that the right one to get the thing

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.670 
like that the right one to get the thing
that<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.660> think<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.870> surprising<00:02:48.290> most<00:02:48.440> about

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that I think the surprising most about

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.380 
that I think the surprising most about
that<00:02:48.859> camera<00:02:49.100> was<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.819> pictures<00:02:50.150> really

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that camera was that the pictures really

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.140 
that camera was that the pictures really
scrubbed<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.109> well<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> grade<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.760> I'm<00:02:52.910> just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
scrubbed up well in a grade so I'm just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.449 
scrubbed up well in a grade so I'm just
a<00:02:53.239> human<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.690> I'm<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> shooting<00:02:54.709> director<00:02:55.250> I've

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
a human and I'm a shooting director I've

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.629 
a human and I'm a shooting director I've
been<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.970> Gaza<00:02:56.319> Zimbabwe<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.620> most<00:02:58.280> recently

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
been to Gaza Zimbabwe and most recently

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.370

to Kashmir wherever you are and whatever

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.809 
to Kashmir wherever you are and whatever
you're<00:03:00.709> doing<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.220> still<00:03:01.430> want<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.609> make<00:03:01.760> sure

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
you're doing you still want to make sure

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.090 
you're doing you still want to make sure
that<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.930> grab<00:03:03.230> your<00:03:03.260> bag<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.590> run<00:03:03.950> if

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
that you can grab your bag and run if

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.680 
that you can grab your bag and run if
you<00:03:04.190> need<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.519> when<00:03:04.940> you're<00:03:05.120> going<00:03:05.450> into

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you need to when you're going into

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.780 
you need to when you're going into
extreme<00:03:05.959> environments<00:03:06.709> but<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.310> that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
extreme environments but you know that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.729 
extreme environments but you know that
that<00:03:08.239> you're<00:03:08.389> not<00:03:08.420> actually<00:03:08.780> doing<00:03:09.440> something

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
that you're not actually doing something

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.729 
that you're not actually doing something
that<00:03:09.980> goes<00:03:10.250> against<00:03:11.019> what's<00:03:12.019> expected<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.590> you

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
that goes against what's expected of you

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.860 
that goes against what's expected of you
then<00:03:13.010> then<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> would<00:03:13.880> move<00:03:14.060> more<00:03:14.600> into<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
then then I would move more into a

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.259 
then then I would move more into a
camera<00:03:15.109> such<00:03:15.350> as<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.590> pnw<00:03:16.130> 200<00:03:16.639> for<00:03:17.000> me<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
camera such as the pnw 200 for me the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.840 
camera such as the pnw 200 for me the
pmw<00:03:17.780> 200<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.350> fantastic<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.250> many<00:03:19.670> regards

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
pmw 200 is fantastic in many regards

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.229 
pmw 200 is fantastic in many regards
it's<00:03:20.389> it's<00:03:21.109> still<00:03:21.470> small<00:03:22.280> enough<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:23.030> it's

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
it's it's still small enough then it's
