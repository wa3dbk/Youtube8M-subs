00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

hi<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.870> under<00:00:01.199> wolf<00:00:01.380> in<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.159> I'm

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hi this is under wolf in this video I'm

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.860 
hi this is under wolf in this video I'm
going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.730> talking<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.389> structures

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
going to be talking about the structures

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.960 
going to be talking about the structures
of<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.200> airway<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.160> want<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.520> talk<00:00:05.700> about

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
of the airway now I want to talk about

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.909 
of the airway now I want to talk about
sort<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.270> an<00:00:06.390> underlying<00:00:06.629> concept<00:00:07.410> here<00:00:07.680> there

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
sort of an underlying concept here there

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.580 
sort of an underlying concept here there
are<00:00:08.160> really<00:00:08.189> sort<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> two<00:00:09.000> basic<00:00:09.590> categories

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
are really sort of two basic categories

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.190 
are really sort of two basic categories
of<00:00:10.639> Airways<00:00:11.670> when<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.420> think<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
of Airways when we think about the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.790 
of Airways when we think about the
functional<00:00:13.740> units<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.940> lung<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.870> really

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
functional units of the lung so really

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.790 
functional units of the lung so really
the<00:00:17.220> function<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> lung<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.439> have

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
the function of the lung is to have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.840 
the function of the lung is to have
oxygen<00:00:20.640> brought<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.750> from<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.109> air<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.850> then

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
oxygen brought in from the air and then

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.420 
oxygen brought in from the air and then
to<00:00:24.180> cross<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.930> alveolar<00:00:25.380> membrane<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
to cross the alveolar membrane into the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.349 
to cross the alveolar membrane into the
blood<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.570> far<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:27.900> bringing<00:00:28.289> oxygen<00:00:29.359> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
blood so as far as bringing oxygen to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.229 
blood so as far as bringing oxygen to
the<00:00:30.539> bloodstream<00:00:33.380> there<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.969> these<00:00:35.969> are

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the bloodstream there are these are

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.860 
the bloodstream there are these are
called<00:00:37.040> exchange<00:00:38.040> units<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.750> are

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
called exchange units or the they are

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
called exchange units or the they are
the<00:00:40.020> functional<00:00:40.530> exchange<00:00:41.430> units<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the functional exchange units of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.040 
the functional exchange units of the
lungs<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.660> these<00:00:46.079> exchange<00:00:46.620> units<00:00:47.010> include

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
lungs and these exchange units include

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
lungs and these exchange units include
the<00:00:50.390> alveoli<00:00:52.489> which<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:54.800> little<00:00:55.800> air<00:00:56.070> sacs

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the alveoli which are little air sacs

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.500 
the alveoli which are little air sacs
which<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:59.300> microscopic<00:01:00.300> air

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
which you can see here microscopic air

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.250 
which you can see here microscopic air
sacs<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:02.760> end<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
sacs that are at the very end of the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.250 
sacs that are at the very end of the
bronchioles<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:06.020> respiratory<00:01:07.970> bronchioles

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.700 

now<00:01:14.570> sort<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> getting<00:01:15.780> ahead<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> myself<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
now sort of getting ahead of myself a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
now sort of getting ahead of myself a
little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.630> get<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.780> sort

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
little bit but I want to get this sort

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.880 
little bit but I want to get this sort
of<00:01:19.650> broad<00:01:19.860> categorization<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> way

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
of broad categorization out of the way

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
of broad categorization out of the way
so<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> functional<00:01:24.270> exchange

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so these are the functional exchange

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.310 
so these are the functional exchange
units<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:27.090> lung<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.689> piece<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
units of the lung in this piece of the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
units of the lung in this piece of the
only<00:01:28.530> places<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.750> gas<00:01:30.750> exchange<00:01:31.430> occurs<00:01:32.430> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
only places that gas exchange occurs to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.310 
only places that gas exchange occurs to
the<00:01:33.299> bloodstream<00:01:33.890> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.369> Airways

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
the bloodstream all the other Airways

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.060 
the bloodstream all the other Airways
from<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:38.430> mouth<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.909> nose<00:01:39.380> down<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.920> way

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
from the mouth and nose down all the way

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:50.149 
from the mouth and nose down all the way
down<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:47.220> these<00:01:47.540> functional<00:01:48.770> alveoli<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
down to these functional alveoli and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.910 
down to these functional alveoli and
respiratory<00:01:51.030> bronchials<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:52.189> what's<00:01:53.189> called

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
respiratory bronchials is what's called

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.080 
respiratory bronchials is what's called
anatomic<00:01:55.920> dead<00:01:56.219> space<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.909> called

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
anatomic dead space and it's called

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
anatomic dead space and it's called
anatomic<00:02:00.659> dead<00:02:00.869> space<00:02:02.119> because<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.799> terms

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
anatomic dead space because in in terms

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.010 
anatomic dead space because in in terms
of<00:02:05.689> gas<00:02:06.689> exchange<00:02:07.550> it<00:02:08.550> has<00:02:08.759> no<00:02:08.970> role<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of gas exchange it has no role at all it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
of gas exchange it has no role at all it
is<00:02:10.259> inert<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> dead<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.270> anatomic<00:02:12.930> dead<00:02:13.110> space

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
is inert and dead so anatomic dead space

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
is inert and dead so anatomic dead space
and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.850 
and
means<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.460> these<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:15.410> parts<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.650> lung

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
means that these are parts of the lung

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.660 
means that these are parts of the lung
in<00:02:17.130> which<00:02:18.000> no<00:02:18.360> gas<00:02:18.600> exchange<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:20.040> occur<00:02:20.340> so

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
in which no gas exchange can occur so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.210 
in which no gas exchange can occur so
the<00:02:20.700> air<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.810> are<00:02:21.840> passive<00:02:22.680> conduits

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the air just they are passive conduits

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.930 
the air just they are passive conduits
of<00:02:23.580> air<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:25.590> are<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> pipes<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
of air they are just the pipes in a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.810 
of air they are just the pipes in a
plumbing<00:02:30.209> system<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:34.500> get<00:02:34.770> air<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.640> these

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
plumbing system to get air to these

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
plumbing system to get air to these
active<00:02:36.450> exchange<00:02:37.020> units<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> let's<00:02:39.600> talk

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
active exchange units so let's talk

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.320 
active exchange units so let's talk
about<00:02:39.900> what<00:02:40.380> those<00:02:40.950> structures<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
about what those structures of the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.229 
about what those structures of the
passes<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.230> these<00:02:43.410> passive<00:02:43.830> conduits<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:44.520> it

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
passes of these passive conduits are it

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.440 
passes of these passive conduits are it
really<00:02:45.320> starts<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.400> mouth<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
really starts with the mouth the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.290 
really starts with the mouth the
cavities<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.350> nasal<00:02:49.590> cavity<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.940> oral

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
cavities the nasal cavity in the oral

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.710 
cavities the nasal cavity in the oral
cavity<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:53.250> from<00:02:53.700> there<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.600> gonna

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
cavity and then from there I'm gonna

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.930 
cavity and then from there I'm gonna
move<00:02:55.230> down<00:02:55.440> here<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.489> picture<00:02:56.820> actually

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
move down here to to a picture actually

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.040 
move down here to to a picture actually
this<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> cutaway<00:02:57.750> from<00:02:58.080> Grey's<00:02:58.350> Anatomy

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
this is a cutaway from Grey's Anatomy

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.880 
this is a cutaway from Grey's Anatomy
which<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> classic<00:03:02.250> anatomic<00:03:02.820> textbook

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
which is a classic anatomic textbook

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.199 
which is a classic anatomic textbook
that<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.100> actually<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.580> public<00:03:05.880> domain<00:03:06.030> so

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
that is actually in the public domain so

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.850 
that is actually in the public domain so
we<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:06.840> free<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.140> use<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.630> air<00:03:10.290> travels

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
we are all free to use it so air travels

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.890 
we are all free to use it so air travels
in<00:03:11.480> through<00:03:12.480> either<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:14.010> nose<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.870> mouth

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
in through either the nose or the mouth

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.300 
in through either the nose or the mouth
and<00:03:17.209> then<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.390> travels<00:03:18.630> through<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.980> nasal

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and then it travels through the nasal

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.180 
and then it travels through the nasal
pharynx<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:22.130> oral<00:03:23.130> pharynx<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:25.190> laryngeal

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
pharynx and oral pharynx and laryngeal

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.990 
pharynx and oral pharynx and laryngeal
pharynx<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:28.019> these<00:03:28.200> are<00:03:28.410> all<00:03:28.560> part<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:29.579> the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
pharynx so these are all part of the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.940 
pharynx so these are all part of the
pharynx<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.720> pharynx<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.290> divided<00:03:34.799> up

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
pharynx so the pharynx is divided up

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.990 
pharynx so the pharynx is divided up
into<00:03:36.739> sort<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.769> three<00:03:38.010> parts<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.730> nasal

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
into sort of three parts the nasal

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.600 
into sort of three parts the nasal
pharynx<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.950> oral<00:03:41.489> pharynx<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:43.610> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
pharynx the oral pharynx and the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.870 
pharynx the oral pharynx and the
laryngeal<00:03:46.790> pharynx<00:03:48.019> okay<00:03:49.019> now<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.700> look

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
laryngeal pharynx okay now if you look

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.430 
laryngeal pharynx okay now if you look
here<00:03:53.360> there<00:03:54.360> is<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.900> piece<00:03:55.049> of<00:03:55.079> tissue

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
here there is a little piece of tissue

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.240 
here there is a little piece of tissue
here<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> very<00:03:58.680> important<00:03:59.100> piece

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
here and this is a very important piece

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.910 
here and this is a very important piece
of<00:03:59.280> tissue<00:03:59.610> because<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.480> called<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
of tissue because this is called the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.660 
of tissue because this is called the
epiglottis

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
epiglottis

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.810 
epiglottis
now<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.450> epiglottis<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.620> piece<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.489> tissue

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
now the epiglottis is a piece of tissue

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:13.610 
now the epiglottis is a piece of tissue
that<00:04:06.150> flaps<00:04:07.370> across<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:10.049> larynx<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:13.290> close

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
that flaps across the larynx to close

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.659 
that flaps across the larynx to close
off<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.519> airway<00:04:14.970> when<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.720> swallow<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:17.100> if<00:04:17.430> we

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
off the airway when we swallow so if we

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.270 
off the airway when we swallow so if we
are<00:04:17.700> taking<00:04:18.299> in<00:04:18.630> food<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.200> not<00:04:19.410> air<00:04:19.739> if<00:04:20.130> we

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
are taking in food and not air if we

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360 
are taking in food and not air if we
take<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.700> bolus<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.150> food<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.720> not<00:04:22.560> air<00:04:22.860> then

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
take in a bolus of food and not air then

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.260 
take in a bolus of food and not air then
this

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
this

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.749 
this
the<00:04:24.360> glottis<00:04:24.720> is<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.199> fault<00:04:25.680> unfold<00:04:26.610> is

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
the glottis is going to fault unfold is

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.600 
the glottis is going to fault unfold is
going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.090> close<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.620> bolus<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.069> food<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
going to close and the bolus of food is

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.710 
going to close and the bolus of food is
going<00:04:29.849> to<00:04:30.030> go<00:04:30.150> down<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.840> esophagus<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.360> not

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
going to go down the esophagus and not

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.249 
going to go down the esophagus and not
the<00:04:33.870> airway<00:04:34.430> okay<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.210> we're<00:04:39.990> talking

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
the airway okay so that is we're talking

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.119 
the airway okay so that is we're talking
about<00:04:40.349> food<00:04:40.710> there

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
about food there

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.200 
about food there
now<00:04:41.810> here<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:44.159> larynx<00:04:44.639> which

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
now here we have the larynx which

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:54.989 
now here we have the larynx which
includes<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.710> vocal<00:04:47.129> folds

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.039 

and<00:04:55.709> within<00:04:56.999> the<00:04:57.999> space<00:04:58.299> in<00:04:58.569> between<00:04:58.749> the

00:04:59.039 --> 00:04:59.049 
and within the space in between the

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.059 
and within the space in between the
vocal<00:04:59.349> folds<00:05:00.099> is<00:05:00.249> called<00:05:01.179> the<00:05:02.079> glottis<00:05:02.559> so

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
vocal folds is called the glottis so

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.429 
vocal folds is called the glottis so
that<00:05:03.219> is<00:05:03.399> actually<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.939> space<00:05:04.629> in<00:05:04.869> between<00:05:04.899> so

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
that is actually the space in between so

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.909 
that is actually the space in between so
we<00:05:05.469> have<00:05:05.739> the<00:05:06.519> vocal<00:05:06.969> folds<00:05:07.389> here<00:05:07.629> so<00:05:08.619> this<00:05:08.739> is

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
we have the vocal folds here so this is

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.779 
we have the vocal folds here so this is
the<00:05:09.039> larynx<00:05:09.429> we<00:05:10.389> have<00:05:10.509> the<00:05:10.659> vocal<00:05:11.019> folds<00:05:11.789> and

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
the larynx we have the vocal folds and

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:20.279 
the larynx we have the vocal folds and
it<00:05:13.539> is<00:05:13.689> this<00:05:13.959> space<00:05:15.209> in<00:05:16.209> between<00:05:19.079> that<00:05:20.079> is

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
it is this space in between that is

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.379 
it is this space in between that is
called<00:05:20.559> the<00:05:21.239> glottis<00:05:23.639> so<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.759> glottis<00:05:25.119> isn't

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
called the glottis so the glottis isn't

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.809 
called the glottis so the glottis isn't
really<00:05:25.569> a<00:05:25.599> structure<00:05:26.199> it's<00:05:26.469> a<00:05:26.679> space<00:05:27.489> in

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
really a structure it's a space in

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.049 
really a structure it's a space in
between<00:05:27.879> the<00:05:28.719> vocal<00:05:28.869> folds<00:05:29.489> okay<00:05:30.489> and<00:05:30.789> then

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:31.059 
between the vocal folds okay and then

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.779 
between the vocal folds okay and then
once<00:05:31.329> we<00:05:31.539> get<00:05:31.719> past<00:05:32.079> the<00:05:32.379> larynx<00:05:32.739> we<00:05:33.279> are<00:05:33.429> into

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
once we get past the larynx we are into

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:42.629 
once we get past the larynx we are into
the<00:05:33.909> trachea<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:39.239> move<00:05:40.239> back<00:05:40.449> up<00:05:40.659> here<00:05:41.639> when

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
the trachea and move back up here when

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.169 
the trachea and move back up here when
we<00:05:42.669> go<00:05:42.939> through<00:05:42.969> the<00:05:43.269> trachea<00:05:43.509> the<00:05:44.169> trachea

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:45.179 
we go through the trachea the trachea

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:49.309 
we go through the trachea the trachea
bifurcates<00:05:46.179> splits<00:05:47.079> into<00:05:47.319> two

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
bifurcates splits into two

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.249 
bifurcates splits into two
so<00:05:50.319> we<00:05:50.439> have<00:05:50.559> the<00:05:50.649> trachea<00:05:51.479> that<00:05:52.479> splits<00:05:53.049> into

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
so we have the trachea that splits into

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.959 
so we have the trachea that splits into
two<00:05:54.149> it<00:05:55.149> splits<00:05:55.539> into<00:05:55.719> a<00:05:57.809> right<00:05:58.809> bronchus<00:05:59.619> and

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
two it splits into a right bronchus and

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:07.649 
two it splits into a right bronchus and
a<00:06:00.969> left<00:06:01.329> bronchus<00:06:03.929> and<00:06:06.089> the<00:06:07.089> place<00:06:07.300> that<00:06:07.329> it

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
a left bronchus and the place that it

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.659 
a left bronchus and the place that it
splits<00:06:08.139> off<00:06:08.729> here<00:06:09.729> is<00:06:10.449> called<00:06:10.809> the<00:06:10.929> Carina<00:06:11.669> and

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
splits off here is called the Carina and

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.489 
splits off here is called the Carina and
that's<00:06:13.029> an<00:06:13.179> important<00:06:13.719> structure<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.349> be

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:14.499 
that's an important structure to be

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.819 
that's an important structure to be
aware<00:06:14.769> of<00:06:15.119> and<00:06:16.119> the<00:06:16.629> karana<00:06:16.929> is<00:06:17.199> just<00:06:17.529> that

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:17.829 
aware of and the karana is just that

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:20.669 
aware of and the karana is just that
that<00:06:18.249> area<00:06:18.610> that<00:06:19.119> little<00:06:19.389> sort<00:06:19.629> of<00:06:19.719> triangular

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:20.679 
that area that little sort of triangular

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.399 
that area that little sort of triangular
area<00:06:21.249> where<00:06:21.849> the<00:06:22.029> right<00:06:22.239> and<00:06:22.509> left<00:06:22.869> here<00:06:23.259> let

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
area where the right and left here let

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:24.869 
area where the right and left here let
me<00:06:23.439> draw<00:06:23.679> that<00:06:23.709> in<00:06:23.860> a<00:06:24.039> different<00:06:24.189> color<00:06:24.399> so<00:06:24.610> we

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
me draw that in a different color so we

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:30.739 
me draw that in a different color so we
can<00:06:24.909> see<00:06:25.239> that<00:06:25.389> clearly<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:28.360> Carina<00:06:28.719> is<00:06:29.289> that

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:30.749 
can see that clearly the Carina is that

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:33.629 
can see that clearly the Carina is that
sort<00:06:31.749> of<00:06:31.839> pointy<00:06:32.199> area<00:06:32.559> where<00:06:33.099> the<00:06:33.249> right<00:06:33.429> and

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
sort of pointy area where the right and

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.129 
sort of pointy area where the right and
left<00:06:33.849> bronchus<00:06:34.679> bifurcate<00:06:35.729> now<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:37.629> right

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
left bronchus bifurcate now the right

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.309 
left bronchus bifurcate now the right
and<00:06:38.409> left<00:06:39.209> bronchus<00:06:40.209> then<00:06:40.629> keep<00:06:41.019> subdividing

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
and left bronchus then keep subdividing

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.219 
and left bronchus then keep subdividing
further<00:06:42.099> and<00:06:42.369> further<00:06:42.549> and<00:06:43.119> we<00:06:43.329> get<00:06:43.539> smaller

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
further and further and we get smaller

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.529 
further and further and we get smaller
and<00:06:44.409> smaller<00:06:44.469> branches<00:06:45.309> of<00:06:45.429> bronchi<00:06:45.819> the

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
and smaller branches of bronchi the

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.249 
and smaller branches of bronchi the
branch<00:06:46.809> is<00:06:47.699> narrow<00:06:48.699> and<00:06:48.969> narrow<00:06:49.259> and

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
branch is narrow and narrow and

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:51.929 
branch is narrow and narrow and
eventually<00:06:50.919> we<00:06:51.099> get<00:06:51.279> into<00:06:51.579> smaller

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
eventually we get into smaller

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.659 
eventually we get into smaller
structures<00:06:52.479> called<00:06:52.779> bronchioles<00:06:53.610> okay<00:06:54.610> so

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
structures called bronchioles okay so

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.059 
structures called bronchioles okay so
that's<00:06:54.909> my<00:06:55.059> basic<00:06:55.479> overview<00:06:55.929> of<00:06:56.139> the<00:06:56.559> anatomy

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
that's my basic overview of the anatomy

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:00.089 
that's my basic overview of the anatomy
of<00:06:57.099> the<00:06:58.059> structures<00:06:58.419> of<00:06:58.449> the<00:06:58.659> airway<00:06:59.079> in<00:06:59.379> my

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
of the structures of the airway in my

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.589 
of the structures of the airway in my
next<00:07:00.369> video<00:07:00.610> I<00:07:00.669> want<00:07:01.029> to<00:07:01.059> talk<00:07:01.209> a<00:07:01.269> little<00:07:01.329> bit

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
next video I want to talk a little bit

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.779 
next video I want to talk a little bit
about<00:07:01.629> the<00:07:02.169> functions<00:07:02.739> of<00:07:02.979> those<00:07:03.309> structures

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
about the functions of those structures

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.730 
about the functions of those structures
in<00:07:04.029> particular<00:07:04.269> I'm<00:07:04.899> going<00:07:04.929> to<00:07:05.199> talk<00:07:05.319> about

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
in particular I'm going to talk about

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.629 
in particular I'm going to talk about
the

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
the

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.219 
the
the<00:07:07.389> specific<00:07:08.379> cellular<00:07:09.039> lining<00:07:09.759> of<00:07:09.909> the<00:07:10.479> of

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
the specific cellular lining of the of

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.429 
the specific cellular lining of the of
the<00:07:11.530> airways<00:07:12.009> and<00:07:12.360> how<00:07:13.360> that<00:07:13.599> works<00:07:13.900> to

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:14.439 
the airways and how that works to

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.969 
the airways and how that works to
protect<00:07:15.069> our<00:07:15.370> our<00:07:16.240> lower<00:07:16.870> Airways<00:07:17.499> from

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
protect our our lower Airways from

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.149 
protect our our lower Airways from
infection<00:07:18.939> and<00:07:19.090> foreign<00:07:19.389> bodies<00:07:19.749> so<00:07:20.529> I<00:07:20.889> will

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159 
infection and foreign bodies so I will

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:22.890 
infection and foreign bodies so I will
see<00:07:21.370> you<00:07:21.460> in<00:07:21.610> that<00:07:21.729> next<00:07:21.789> video<00:07:22.330> thank<00:07:22.840> you

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
see you in that next video thank you

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.319 
see you in that next video thank you
very<00:07:23.080> much
