watching<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.580> is<00:01:36.170> visionary<00:01:41.240> visionary

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.100 

also<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.160> course<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.730> less<00:01:51.030> fallout<00:01:51.750> if

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
also of course there's less fallout if

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.200 
also of course there's less fallout if
you<00:01:52.950> apply<00:01:53.400> them<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.780> loose<00:01:58.080> shadow

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
you apply them what it is a loose shadow

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.460 
you apply them what it is a loose shadow
so<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.330> have<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.600> careful<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:01.080> fallout

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470

this<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.840> also<00:05:13.110> chunky<00:05:13.530> but<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.919> also<00:05:14.070> breaks

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
this is also chunky but it also breaks

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.620 
this is also chunky but it also breaks
up<00:05:15.150> easier<00:05:16.550> while<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:18.919> pigments<00:05:19.919> are<00:05:20.099> like

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
up easier while the pigments are like

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
up easier while the pigments are like
glittery<00:05:21.630> chunky<00:05:22.580> like<00:05:23.580> these

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
glittery chunky like these

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.360

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
Mac are like balls of chunks that could

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.090 
Mac are like balls of chunks that could
break<00:05:28.520> up<00:05:28.729> easily<00:05:28.910> while<00:05:29.360> these<00:05:29.660> are<00:05:29.930> like

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
break up easily while these are like

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.379 
break up easily while these are like
square<00:05:31.630> glittery<00:05:32.740> chunks<00:05:33.940> but<00:05:34.940> they<00:05:35.150> break<00:05:35.360> up

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
square glittery chunks but they break up

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.140 
square glittery chunks but they break up
to<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.259> end<00:05:36.850> they're<00:05:37.850> pretty<00:05:38.090> much

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
to and in the end they're pretty much

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.140 
to and in the end they're pretty much
the<00:05:38.270> same<00:05:38.600> thing<00:05:39.550> so<00:05:40.550> if<00:05:40.729> you<00:05:40.850> have<00:05:41.030> any
