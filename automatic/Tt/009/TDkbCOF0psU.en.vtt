00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
think mostly the special texture so our

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.170 
think mostly the special texture so our
silhouette<00:03:12.239> Zohar<00:03:13.760> or<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.060> yes<00:03:15.959> what<00:03:17.180> do

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
silhouette Zohar or is this yes what do

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.449 
silhouette Zohar or is this yes what do
do<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:21.109> feed<00:03:22.109> up<00:03:22.260> some<00:03:22.470> things<00:03:22.709> again<00:03:23.099> do

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
do to do to feed up some things again do

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.180 
do to do to feed up some things again do
to<00:03:23.640> do<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.950> actually<00:03:25.950> be

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
to do that it can actually be

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.860 
to do that it can actually be
interesting<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.299> play<00:03:27.540> through<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
interesting if you can play through the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.259 
interesting if you can play through the
game<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.349> hard<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.220> guess<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.180> would

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
game is so hard because I guess I would

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.490 
game is so hard because I guess I would
give<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.569> little<00:03:30.720> bit<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.079> control<00:03:31.470> over
