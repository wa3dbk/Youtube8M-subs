00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.400
 he 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 I see all these I live 4.66 for 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 full of tutoring that today a whole 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.950
 new photoshop tutorial the effect of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 saints so it's really a very effect 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.560
 easy to do it does not take anymore 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 one minute 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 so as you can see on the screen 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.950
 that's the effect we're going to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 realize the gemmi another effect for 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.850
 to be able to see the difference but otherwise we 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.900
 will realize this effect there so we will 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 start right now I deleted 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.790
 all my layers on my base image 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 so this one is my basic image so 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.579
 I'm just going to click 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.290
 right to pixelate the layer like this 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 then on this picture there we go all 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.440
 simply ali whose images black settings 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.200
 and white ok so there our picture and in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 black and white we will duplicate this calculation 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.270
 so ordered or against the gie for 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.379
 windows users on the 2nd 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 layer we will go to images settings 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.150
 negative commands y or against libourne 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.320
 windows that keyboard shortcuts on 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.920
 the image we just passed in 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 negative 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.270
 we will simply change the mode of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.369
 fusion in color density - so well 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 obviously our picture will become white 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.039
 and then that's where everything will be played 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.359
 it's going to go in filter we're going to go in 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.829
 the Gaussian blur is there like 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.869
 you can see our picture appears 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.840
 like a drawing after that you settle 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.159
