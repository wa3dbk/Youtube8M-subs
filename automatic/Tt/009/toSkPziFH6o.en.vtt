00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you a little bit about the progressions

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
you a little bit about the progressions
from<00:00:36.510> six<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> nine<00:00:37.020> year<00:00:37.380> olds<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> ten<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
from six to nine year olds to ten to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.490 
from six to nine year olds to ten to
thirteen<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> first<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.320> do

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
thirteen so the first one that we do

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.709 
thirteen so the first one that we do
with<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.890> six<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> nine<00:00:41.550> year<00:00:41.760> olds<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> we

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
with our six to nine year olds is we

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.130 
with our six to nine year olds is we
call<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.170> monster<00:00:43.469> walk<00:00:44.450> into<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> bear<00:00:45.809> crawl

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
call it a monster walk into a bear crawl

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
call it a monster walk into a bear crawl
a<00:00:46.469> monster<00:00:47.280> walk<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.700> no<00:00:47.879> more<00:00:48.090> than<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> lunge

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
a monster walk is no more than a lunge

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
a monster walk is no more than a lunge
walk<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.230> we'll<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> kids<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.070> their

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
walk so we'll have the kids put their

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
walk so we'll have the kids put their
arms<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.239> engage<00:00:51.420> their<00:00:51.870> cores

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
arms up to kind of engage their cores

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.979 
arms up to kind of engage their cores
and<00:00:52.530> try<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> keep<00:00:53.399> their<00:00:53.640> chins<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.210> having

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and try to keep their chins up having

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.299 
and try to keep their chins up having
reach<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> lights<00:00:55.739> they're<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.219> going

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
reach for the lights they're just going

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
reach for the lights they're just going
to<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> lunge<00:00:56.910> walk<00:00:57.620> okay

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
to do a lunge walk okay

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.430 
to do a lunge walk okay
we'll<00:00:59.280> give<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.120> prescribed<00:01:00.899> number<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we'll give them a prescribed number of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
we'll give them a prescribed number of
steps<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> certain<00:01:02.760> amount<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.120> distance

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
steps or a certain amount of distance

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.429 
steps or a certain amount of distance
sometimes<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.830> reactive<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:06.260> when<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
sometimes we make it reactive so when we

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
sometimes we make it reactive so when we
give<00:01:07.680> them<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> coaching<00:01:08.520> cue<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.970> then

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
give them the coaching cue they then

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
give them the coaching cue they then
have<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.750> switch<00:01:10.080> they'll<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have to switch they'll get down on the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
have to switch they'll get down on the
ground<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> perform<00:01:12.990> their

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ground and they have to perform their

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.789 
ground and they have to perform their
bare<00:01:13.740> crawl<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.720> okay<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.710> one

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bare crawl in here okay so it's one

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.020 
bare crawl in here okay so it's one
movement<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> other<00:01:19.460> again<00:01:20.460> when

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
movement right into the other again when

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
movement right into the other again when
we<00:01:21.180> try<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> progress<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> younger

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
we try to progress it with the younger

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
we try to progress it with the younger
kids<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.759> trying<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
kids all we're trying to do really is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
kids all we're trying to do really is
make<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.080> reactive<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:26.490> may<00:01:26.759> put<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
make it reactive we may put it into a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
make it reactive we may put it into a
reactive<00:01:28.500> state<00:01:28.799> sooner<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.759> our<00:01:29.970> older

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
reactive state sooner with our older

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
reactive state sooner with our older
kids<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.840> 10<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> 13<00:01:31.650> year<00:01:31.829> olds<00:01:32.100> because

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
kids are 10 to 13 year olds because

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
kids are 10 to 13 year olds because
they're<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> much<00:01:33.240> further<00:01:33.540> along<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.710> have

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
they're that much further along you have

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
they're that much further along you have
to<00:01:35.009> remember<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.549> primarily<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> 6<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> 9

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to remember that primarily for a 6 to 9

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.719 
to remember that primarily for a 6 to 9
year<00:01:37.439> old<00:01:37.560> they're<00:01:37.740> still<00:01:38.040> discovering

year old they're still discovering

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
year old they're still discovering
movement<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> first<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.860> 10<00:01:41.100> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
movement for the first time you're 10 to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.850 
movement for the first time you're 10 to
13<00:01:41.729> year<00:01:41.970> olds<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.360> exploring<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.320> learning

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
13 year olds are exploring and learning

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
13 year olds are exploring and learning
about<00:01:44.040> movement<00:01:44.550> now<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.510> can<00:01:45.690> bring<00:01:45.870> him

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
about movement now and you can bring him

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
about movement now and you can bring him
to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> next<00:01:46.440> level<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.190> times<00:01:47.400> just<00:01:47.520> do

both groups and again I'll show you a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.180 
both groups and again I'll show you a
little<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.880> progression<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.920> log

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
little bit of a progression it's a log

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.510 
little bit of a progression it's a log
roll<00:01:59.520> to<00:02:00.120> work<00:02:00.300> on<00:02:00.540> their<00:02:00.750> core<00:02:01.520> enrolling

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
roll to work on their core enrolling

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.230 
roll to work on their core enrolling
skills<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:04.460> spatial<00:02:05.460> awareness<00:02:05.550> for<00:02:06.120> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
skills really spatial awareness for the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.630 
skills really spatial awareness for the
younger<00:02:06.570> kids<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:07.620> then<00:02:07.830> we<00:02:08.190> work<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
younger kids and then we work on a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
younger kids and then we work on a
little<00:02:08.850> upper<00:02:09.179> extremity<00:02:09.750> strength<00:02:09.810> again

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
little upper extremity strength again

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.050 
little upper extremity strength again
core<00:02:10.709> strength<00:02:11.070> where<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.340> go<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.550> into<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.820> push

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
core strength where we go up into a push

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.780 
core strength where we go up into a push
up<00:02:12.300> hold<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.290> progression<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> older

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
up hold or the progression for the older

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.199 
up hold or the progression for the older
kids<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.330> an<00:02:15.959> actual<00:02:16.380> push<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.220> between<00:02:17.520> so

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
kids is an actual push up in between so

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.720 
kids is an actual push up in between so
we'll<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.690> kids<00:02:18.959> start<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:20.250> push<00:02:20.490> up

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
we'll have the kids start in a push up

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.030 
we'll have the kids start in a push up
hold<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.360> we'll<00:02:21.870> talk<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.350> making<00:02:22.890> that

stop we'll talk about it and have them
go<00:02:42.150> again<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.140> progression<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.040> younger

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
go again the progression for the younger

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.460 
go again the progression for the younger
guys<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.570> letting<00:02:45.750> them<00:02:46.020> go<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> little

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
guys is really letting them go a little

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.699 
guys is really letting them go a little
bit<00:02:46.709> longer<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.610> might<00:02:47.850> say<00:02:48.090> okay<00:02:48.480> start<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.170> go

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
bit longer we might say okay start up go

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.600 
bit longer we might say okay start up go
down<00:02:49.880> roll<00:02:50.880> once<00:02:51.239> come<00:02:51.690> up<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:52.290> back<00:02:52.320> down<00:02:52.830> roll

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
down roll once come up go back down roll

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.759 
down roll once come up go back down roll
and<00:02:53.940> finish<00:02:54.299> up<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:54.840> let<00:02:55.049> them<00:02:55.230> do<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.440> on

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
and finish up again let them do that on

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.520 
and finish up again let them do that on
their<00:02:55.980> own<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:57.450> again<00:02:57.810> what<00:02:58.080> they're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
their own now again what they're

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
their own now again what they're
discovering<00:02:59.160> these<00:02:59.370> movements<00:02:59.910> for<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
discovering these movements for the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.170 
discovering these movements for the
first<00:03:00.390> time<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:01.140> might<00:03:01.350> see<00:03:01.709> log<00:03:02.070> rolls<00:03:02.459> that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
first time you might see log rolls that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.810 
first time you might see log rolls that
look<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:06.440> okay<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:08.250> alright

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
look like this okay that's alright

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.670 
look like this okay that's alright
they're<00:03:09.090> discovering<00:03:09.750> movement<00:03:10.260> give<00:03:10.470> them

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
they're discovering movement give them

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.030 
they're discovering movement give them
simple<00:03:11.250> cues<00:03:11.780> that's<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.110> entire<00:03:13.470> group<00:03:13.830> if

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
simple cues that's the entire group if

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.070 
simple cues that's the entire group if
they<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.400> make<00:03:14.549> their<00:03:14.730> body<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.269> long<00:03:15.299> as<00:03:15.900> they

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
they can make their body as long as they

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680 
they can make their body as long as they
possibly<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.920> during<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.489> movement<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.390> will

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
possibly can during the movement it will

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.530 
possibly can during the movement it will
get<00:03:18.930> better<00:03:19.260> over<00:03:19.410> time<00:03:19.850> don't<00:03:20.850> over<00:03:21.239> coach

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
get better over time don't over coach

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.560 
get better over time don't over coach
and<00:03:21.870> allow<00:03:22.200> them<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.530> explore<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:24.150> again<00:03:24.420> with

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
and allow them to explore now again with

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.390 
and allow them to explore now again with
the<00:03:24.690> older<00:03:25.049> kids<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.920> way<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.100> I<00:03:26.340> would

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
the older kids the way that I would

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.130 
the older kids the way that I would
progress<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.269> either

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
progress that is either

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.200 
progress that is either
and<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:28.380> another<00:03:28.740> log<00:03:29.190> roll<00:03:29.490> so<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:29.910> two

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
and then another log roll so it's two

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.430 
and then another log roll so it's two
over<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.170> up<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.800> or<00:03:32.790> what<00:03:33.569> we'll<00:03:33.750> do<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
over and then up and or what we'll do is

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.280 
over and then up and or what we'll do is
have<00:03:34.950> them<00:03:35.100> log<00:03:35.340> roll<00:03:35.670> once<00:03:36.000> after<00:03:36.840> they've

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
have them log roll once after they've

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.470 
have them log roll once after they've
completed<00:03:37.950> their<00:03:38.550> first<00:03:38.790> log<00:03:39.180> roll<00:03:40.160> come<00:03:41.160> up

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
completed their first log roll come up

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.230 
completed their first log roll come up
bag<00:03:42.480> out<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> couple<00:03:43.170> push-ups<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.950> then<00:03:44.240> come

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
bag out a couple push-ups and then come

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.090 
bag out a couple push-ups and then come
down<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.840> go<00:03:45.990> back<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.260> other<00:03:46.620> way

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
down and go back the other way

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.640 
down and go back the other way
