00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
and Triggs coats because everybody seems

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.220 
and Triggs coats because everybody seems
to<00:00:10.880> want<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:11.269> talk<00:00:11.420> about<00:00:11.540> that<00:00:11.840> right<00:00:12.019> now

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
to want to talk about that right now

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.530 
to want to talk about that right now
and<00:00:12.620> of<00:00:13.309> course<00:00:13.550> right<00:00:13.910> when<00:00:14.090> I<00:00:14.120> want<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.450> do

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
and of course right when I want to do

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.630 
and of course right when I want to do
that

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
that

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.989 
that
he's<00:00:16.640> jumping<00:00:16.909> down<00:00:17.919> so<00:00:18.919> trig<00:00:19.189> has<00:00:19.460> more<00:00:19.789> of<00:00:19.909> a

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:19.999 
he's jumping down so trig has more of a

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.239 
he's jumping down so trig has more of a
traditional<00:00:20.150> rag<00:00:20.749> doll<00:00:20.989> coat<00:00:21.259> or<00:00:21.859> what<00:00:22.220> I
