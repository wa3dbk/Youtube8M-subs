00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
frustrating and I was thinking about

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.310 
frustrating and I was thinking about

that<00:02:12.030> proton<00:02:12.540> kid<00:02:12.750> was<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.020> proton<00:02:13.379> kid<00:02:13.590> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that proton kid was a proton kid is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.350 
that proton kid was a proton kid is
fighting<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> HRT<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.120> side<00:02:15.330> by

fighting with the HRT the going side by
side<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.870> corner<00:02:16.080> which<00:02:16.260> would<00:02:16.379> never

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
side to this corner which would never

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.309 
side to this corner which would never
work<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.520> them<00:02:17.610> running<00:02:17.849> wide<00:02:18.180> ahead<00:02:18.959> so

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
work one of them running wide ahead so

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.680 
work one of them running wide ahead so
we're<00:02:19.500> coming<00:02:19.680> through<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.400> which<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.239> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
we're coming through this which it you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.059 
we're coming through this which it you
know<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.840> need<00:02:22.050> quite<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> bit<00:02:22.349> down<00:02:22.680> force<00:02:22.920> but

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
know you need quite a bit down force but

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.589 
know you need quite a bit down force but
it's<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:23.370> exactly<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.030> slow<00:02:24.209> corner

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
it's not exactly a really slow corner

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.869 
it's not exactly a really slow corner
and<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.230> well<00:02:25.410> here<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.340> hit<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> cool

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
and it's well here if you hit the cool

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.850 
and it's well here if you hit the cool
apex<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:27.390> perfect<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.650> get<00:02:28.770> it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
apex is perfect there you can get it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.290 
apex is perfect there you can get it
really<00:02:29.069> fast<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.489> know<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.670> cut<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> corner

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
really fast and I know I cut the corner

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.650 
really fast and I know I cut the corner
over<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:30.660> all<00:02:30.900> nearly<00:02:31.530> push<00:02:31.860> him<00:02:32.040> off<00:02:32.660> but

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
over there all nearly push him off but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.330 
over there all nearly push him off but
that's<00:02:34.470> something<00:02:34.620> I've<00:02:34.890> learnt<00:02:35.129> on<00:02:35.220> this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that's something I've learnt on this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's something I've learnt on this
game<00:02:35.489> as<00:02:35.580> well<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.910> somebody's<00:02:36.239> going<00:02:36.450> really

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
game as well if somebody's going really

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
game as well if somebody's going really
deep<00:02:36.900> into<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> corner<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.709> let<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.099> be

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
deep into a corner just let them be

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
deep into a corner just let them be
they're<00:02:38.849> gonna<00:02:39.000> make<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> mistake<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.900> he<00:02:40.050> did

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
they're gonna make the mistake as he did

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.500 
they're gonna make the mistake as he did
there<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.650> saw<00:02:41.190> him<00:02:41.430> go<00:02:41.640> deep<00:02:41.940> into<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> first

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
there I saw him go deep into the first

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.910 
there I saw him go deep into the first
corner<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:43.019> meant<00:02:43.260> he<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.470> wide<00:02:43.680> on<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
corner which meant he was wide on the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 
corner which meant he was wide on the
second<00:02:44.250> corner<00:02:44.430> which<00:02:45.000> them<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.540> turn<00:02:45.810> men<00:02:46.709> I

second corner which them in turn men I

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.140 
second corner which them in turn men I
got<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.220> position<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.790> he<00:02:47.879> was<00:02:47.970> out<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
got the position because he was out of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.630 
got the position because he was out of
position<00:02:48.330> on<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.349> track<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.099> proton<00:02:50.459> kid

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
position on the track so the proton kid

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.089 
position on the track so the proton kid
now<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.819> had<00:02:51.060> Mercedes<00:02:51.720> gone<00:02:51.930> wide<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.739> leaving

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
now I had Mercedes gone wide the leaving

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.130 
now I had Mercedes gone wide the leaving
me<00:02:53.190> space<00:02:53.430> which<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.760> nice<00:02:53.940> now<00:02:54.330> going<00:02:54.840> leaving

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
me space which is nice now going leaving

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.649 
me space which is nice now going leaving
only<00:02:55.800> refers<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.310> him<00:02:56.400> as<00:02:56.430> well<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.879> then<00:02:57.420> he

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
only refers to him as well and then he

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.180 
only refers to him as well and then he
drops<00:02:57.870> pint<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.440> guess<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:58.890> don't<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.069> what

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
drops pint I guess I don't know what

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.280 
drops pint I guess I don't know what
that<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.459> take<00:02:59.640> out<00:02:59.819> move<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:01.140> he

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
that was to take out move or not but he

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.809 
that was to take out move or not but he
definitely<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:02.040> definitely<00:03:02.159> left<00:03:02.459> me<00:03:02.640> sighs

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
definitely he definitely left me sighs

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.640
