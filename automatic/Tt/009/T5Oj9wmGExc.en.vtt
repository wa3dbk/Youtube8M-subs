00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.070
 super mario 3d world is whole 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.559
 becomes revolutionary for princess peach 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.590
 Do not take the power with you 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.449
 Incredible instead, these are the ones 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.359
 missing kidnapped because we see one right away 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.310
 and you can do super mario 3d world too 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.929
 very comfortable with a maximum of four 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.999
 you can just play one of the players 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.460
 get out during the zoo what a 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.869
 cool thing is exactly and there is too 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.160
 just nothing pixies prepare 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:41.379
 we already have a bit of gameplay 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.920
 and also in costumes that cats 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.539
 costume 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 I think it's personal 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.710
 So little drug too strong because you 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 can always be on the walls the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 seconded so that red has fallen 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 You can also see the double 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 cherry 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.100
 this is an old doubles player 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.699
 then why it is now available for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 princess peach and two marios 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.060
 Also new is the crown of the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 Mario has it on you if you can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 you reach the highest point at the end 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 at the flagpole or has more points than 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.580
 the other players and you wear them 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 then and at the end of the level if you have it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.180
 also manage to keep it then get it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.460
 you add another 5000 extra points 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.740
 account exactly in the basic player cooperative 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.270
 but because at the end over the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 Points should be addressed to the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.360
 Crowns gets created in ours 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.429
 some competition a bit much 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200
 chaos so if the goals of the four 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.580
 player runs double stupid then you can 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.830
 already imagine what if 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.509
 A big box office is or will be 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.590
 beautiful 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.530
 I think that looks very pretty too 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.690
 So finally in hd 1 mario and me 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 I think the design is really lucky 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.159
 colorful and also very clean look 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.350
 is now compared to super mario 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.360
 galaxy not so worn off by 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 Level design until now never exactly what but 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.950
 The worlds eight are quite cool 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.899
 World no one can visit again though 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.239
 all again in the setting but the levels 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.410
 even these are visually very 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.410
 varied designed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.790
 So a very conclusive conclusion can 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.920
 I do not give yet because at the time 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.070
 I am not quite sure of the dvd tax 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.520
 through with the game but I guess 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.380
 who plays great mario games is at the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.900
 actually does not lead past that 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 video adventure and just through that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.430
 very easy to get on and off 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.980
 it's good with the family too 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.480
 together we just have the keyword 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.010
 they played a bit together and 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.320
 We both came to the conclusion that 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.270
 game is a bit so far 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.100
 simple but we also have half 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.560
 seen and I think if you can 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.690
 later every level of green stars 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.580
 then you want to find a long time 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.980
 busy yes it is also so 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.200
 bit on the cats suit but overall 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.240
 it is again a very good super mario 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.240
 until now more accurate crafty country 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.160
 No
