00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.000
 I am of our tests concerning the acer 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.370
 iconia tab to b1 so the tablet low 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.769
 cost of acer so we'll talk about everything 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 the technical characteristics aspect of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.240
 this tablet then already we are on a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.400
 7 inch LCD screen 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.140
 be careful it's a screen that is not 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.890
 hyper s you is to say that the angle of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.630
 vision is pretty reduced let's say that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 maximum we can look at roughly 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.340
 twenty degrees on the coast 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 after we have a very very bad image 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.000
 I prefer to specify it because it is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 not a crazy screen either 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.870
 follows a resolution of 1024 by 600 in 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 terms of storage in the tablet 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.210
 so we have 8 giga a new 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.000
 model just out of 16 giga for 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.320
 this tablet is where it's a small 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 little more boring is that we have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.329
 only 512 megabytes of ram and very 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.949
 sincerely it feels a bit because 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.440
 that you see when I turn the pages 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.830
 it tends to a little bit rowed even 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 the display wash right there it goes again 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 but there we feel that it trains a little bit 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 still differently so that's a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.659
 dual core media library processor that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 is clocked at 1 gigabyte of gigahertz 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.140
 about everything connected to a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 cabbage does a little trick 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.540
 so if I go back here so here we can 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.430
 realize that right there it is a 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.799
 micro usb connector 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.689
 so this connector allows you to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.670
 load the tablet but also 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 communicate with your computer 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.400
 portable for example to transfer 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.189
 files here then play louvre here we have 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.549
 a little hatch and it's just the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.140
 heard hop I hold it to see 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 right here you're maybe going to the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 small slot provided for microsd cards 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.649
 it allows us to put cards that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.430
 can go up to 32 gigas of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.530
 storage 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.299
 so that's a good surprise because 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 that it really allows us to have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.700
 a small tool for 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.640
 directly integrated videos or the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 music otherwise here we did strictly 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.739
 nothing on this side there on the top so 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.530
 we only have the 3.5mm jack and 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.190
 here on the side so the power button is 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.209
 paused 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.489
 alas the + - button for managing the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.519
 volume and back so you see the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.310
 rather sober but very plastic design 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.860
 of acer it's pretty much all we 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.840
 a in terms of connectivity 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.870
 from a network point of view so we have 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 wifi and bluetooth 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.530
 we have a battery so the battery is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.319
 rather weak it is a building of 3300 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.590
 milliamperes we have autonomy in video 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.790
 2 about six hours is still 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.560
 low enough for a touch pad 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.970
 especially when we know that the nexus is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.120
 go up to at least 10 hours 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.349
 of autonomy in terms of weight it's 3 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.790
 189 g 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.150
 so that's okay it's a tablet that is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.610
 relatively light which and which contains 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.739
 quite easily in the hands we have a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.140
 camera that is right there is not 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.170
 there is only one here 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.910
 0.3 megapixel camera so much 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560
 tell you that the camera is a big one 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.500
 black dot of this tablet 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.090
 and finally we have an accelerometer 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.130
 a GPS 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.420
 we do not have a light sensor so 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.650
 it's a small complaint that we could 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.510
 to do it is still enough 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.250
 convenient to save battery and 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.000
 to finish the tablet turns with 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.359
 android 4.1 jelly bean so an android 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
 whose quality is more to do 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.850
 that's about all we can 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.200
 find on this tablet 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.200
 that's maybe it can be 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.060
 group
