 mister white and welcome back to this 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.580
 channel and welcome to this video video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.669
 really flying as you well know we are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 practically sending you every 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.650
 information every software video 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 house or large manufacturer 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.499
 video games to show you all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 those that are new 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.060
 Yesterday a lot of videos came out 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 details I will put here as an example 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.930
 you will find the video videoconference 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 let's say sony here I'll put microsoft 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.990
 here I will put the video on call of duty 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 and it is precisely the latter for call of 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.790
 duty advanced warfare that I want 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 talk to you we're leaving I'll leave between 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.910
 a few hours per colony and but the thing more 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.190
 important that yesterday sharing one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.260
 photo I read the comments of some 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.520
 users and indeed we found that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 in the xbox an advanced one 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 warfare so let's say the stylized is there 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.990
 a detail that at first sight 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 honestly I had missed but then 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.829
 later the users pointed it out to me 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.109
 leto them tomorrow as soon as I wake up with the 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.090
 hope to be the first I do a 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.009
 actually some Americans have videos 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.020
 already made a video about this thing so much 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.929
 you can never get over them in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.429
 speed but in short a few words what 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.140
 I mean I want to tell you that yes 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.439
 indeed, there is one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 zombie or pro calm or similar mode 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.420
 zombie on call of duty advanced warfare 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.539
 what is the problem the problem that how 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.539
 you all know the rights we say 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 the authors of the zombie mode are 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.060
 the developers of the treyarch who do not 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.259
 they are the same ones who develop advisers 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.460
 fair since we have sledgehammer 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.569
 games so it looks like maybe there 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.759
 may be a cyborg zombie mode 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.579
 or something very long though 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.399
 similar or maybe they have activision e 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.970
 recited through to let's say let's pass 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.790
 the format and quality and everything 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.190
 the type of gameplay of the mode 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.840
 even zombie hammer games with a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.380
 agreement a monetary exchange and for 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.910
 regarding the slide report 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.549

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.269
