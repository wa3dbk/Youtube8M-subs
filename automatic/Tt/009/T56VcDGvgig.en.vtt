00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.829
 welcome to the katzenberg tunnel if trains 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.050
 at very high speeds tunnel 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.880
 Driving can be a phenomenon that occurs 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.099
 means without popping effect is called 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.810
 Before that, in the animated film shows something 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.750
 more exactly how it affects the phenomena 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.340
 can come or hood construction the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.020
 At the beginning we set up an ic 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.000
 entering the tunnel 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.670
 nice to see in this example 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.490
 that have construction with its ceilings 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 opening as soon as the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.670
 high-speed train in the tunnel 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.740
 the air mass can enter easily 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.380
 escape over this cover opening 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.930
 Thanks to these structures, the emergence 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.860
 of micro pressure waves and thus also the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 tunnel bang effect can be prevented 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.939
 on the north portal with project manager thomas 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.229
 Giger originally come the high 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.359
 Buildings from Japan 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 here are all over Europe here on katzenberg 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.189
 sound or the first location sonic 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.530
 boom works of art come to use 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.240
 and because we vector cats for 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.969
 have decided the open design 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.729
 the buildings are perfect for ours 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:27.600
 dream and we were able to do this too 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.600
 economically 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.359
 Change of location at the south portal has one 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.009
 completely different solution found 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.319
 on the south portal where we are now 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.560
 currently are the air masses 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.340
 over a total of twelve slots in the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 concrete if derived to the outside 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 without these countermeasures 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 train travelers would tunnel 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.429
 perceive the popping effect as pressure in the ear 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.959
 but by the precautions mentioned 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.289
 the journey through the tunnel remains 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.780
 comfortable and relaxed a meaningful 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.130
 and effective technical solution which 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.899
 German railway ag their 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.179
 responsibility in matters of sound and 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.470
 aware of vibration protection wherever it is 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.540
 specifications and guidelines of the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.890
 enable legislators and solutions 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.900
 the track can be realized 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.390
 appropriate measures on 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 Katzenberg Tunnel will be innovative sonic 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.500
 boom builds the residents in future 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 Noise disturbances protect when they are still
