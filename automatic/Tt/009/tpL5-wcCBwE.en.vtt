the<00:00:08.020> whole<00:00:08.200> thing<00:00:08.350> about<00:00:08.530> making<00:00:08.770> espresso<00:00:09.129> is

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
the whole thing about making espresso is

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.449 
the whole thing about making espresso is
typically<00:00:10.510> coffee<00:00:10.840> making<00:00:11.170> takes<00:00:11.559> two<00:00:12.309> and<00:00:12.430> a

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
typically coffee making takes two and a

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.119 
typically coffee making takes two and a
half<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.910> four<00:00:12.940> and<00:00:13.360> a<00:00:13.420> half<00:00:13.449> minutes<00:00:14.010> but<00:00:15.010> in

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
half to four and a half minutes but in

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.670 
half to four and a half minutes but in
this<00:00:15.250> case<00:00:15.490> every<00:00:16.420> variable<00:00:16.840> becomes<00:00:17.320> that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
this case every variable becomes that

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.040 
this case every variable becomes that
much<00:00:17.740> more<00:00:18.010> important<00:00:18.820> because<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.419> the<00:00:19.689> very

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
much more important because of the very

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.839 
much more important because of the very
very<00:00:20.380> short<00:00:20.769> amount<00:00:20.890> of<00:00:21.039> time<00:00:21.130> there's<00:00:21.609> so

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
very short amount of time there's so

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.999 
very short amount of time there's so
much<00:00:22.029> happening<00:00:22.269> it's<00:00:23.080> such<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.349> volatile

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
much happening it's such a volatile

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.120 
much happening it's such a volatile
process<00:00:24.609> it's<00:00:25.240> kind<00:00:25.509> of<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.779> kind<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.499> a<00:00:26.619> violent

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
process it's kind of a kind of a violent

pounds<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:32.320> pressurized<00:00:32.950> water<00:00:33.280> which<00:00:33.610> is

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
pounds of pressurized water which is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.620 
pounds of pressurized water which is
like<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.690> know<00:00:34.810> an<00:00:35.020> adult<00:00:35.200> human<00:00:35.680> beings<00:00:36.250> body

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
like you know an adult human beings body

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.410 
like you know an adult human beings body
being<00:00:37.630> forced<00:00:38.230> through<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.610> tiny<00:00:39.910> wafer

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
being forced through just a tiny wafer

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.710 
being forced through just a tiny wafer
of<00:00:40.540> coffee<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:41.230> any<00:00:41.920> misstep<00:00:42.340> by<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:43.120> barista

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
of coffee and any misstep by the barista

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.670 
of coffee and any misstep by the barista
is<00:00:43.930> going<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:45.900> manifest<00:00:46.900> itself<00:00:47.200> in<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.380> cup

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
is going to manifest itself in the cup

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.860 
is going to manifest itself in the cup
and<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.010> very<00:00:48.430> unpleasant<00:00:48.730> way<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.600> reason

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
and a very unpleasant way and the reason

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.960 
and a very unpleasant way and the reason
is<00:00:49.960> because<00:00:50.160> most<00:00:51.160> people<00:00:51.430> who<00:00:51.520> are<00:00:51.640> preparing

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
is because most people who are preparing

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.520 
is because most people who are preparing
it<00:00:52.180> don't<00:00:52.390> don't<00:00:52.780> give<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.140> sort<00:00:53.470> of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
it don't don't give it that sort of

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.370 
it don't don't give it that sort of
respect<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.790> needs

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.350 

this<00:00:58.380> is<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.560> good<00:00:58.680> practice<00:00:58.920> when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> first

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
this is a good practice when you first

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.300 
this is a good practice when you first
walk<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.900> machine<00:01:01.200> just<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.770> how

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
walk up to the machine just to see how

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.180 
walk up to the machine just to see how
it<00:01:02.460> feels<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:03.780> feels<00:01:03.810> really<00:01:04.290> course<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
it feels it feels really course then it

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.790 
it feels it feels really course then it
probably<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:07.050> of<00:01:07.080> times<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.650> make

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
probably is so a lot of times I can make

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.570 
probably is so a lot of times I can make
an<00:01:07.920> initial<00:01:08.130> adjustment<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.370> feeling<00:01:11.370> it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
an initial adjustment just by feeling it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240 
an initial adjustment just by feeling it
and<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> okay<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.660> off<00:01:13.250> all

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and going okay that's that's off all

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.390 
and going okay that's that's off all
right<00:01:15.440> before<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:16.530> ever<00:01:16.650> prepare<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> shot<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
right before you ever prepare a shot of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.860 
right before you ever prepare a shot of
espresso<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.300> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.510> make<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
espresso you want to make sure to

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.920 
espresso you want to make sure to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
basket is clean and dry because coffee

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
basket is clean and dry because coffee
when<00:01:50.490> its<00:01:50.610> ground<00:01:51.020> exposes<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.500> oil

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
when its ground exposes all of this oil

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
when its ground exposes all of this oil
and<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.580> we<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.729> oil<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.240> water<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:54.720> mix

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and as we know oil and water don't mix

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
and as we know oil and water don't mix
so<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.400> rid<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.670> water<00:01:56.880> allow

the<00:01:57.840> oil<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.350> chance<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.830> do<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.160> does<00:01:59.310> best

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the oil a chance to do what it does best

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.150 
the oil a chance to do what it does best
which<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.000> seal<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.590> area<00:02:01.860> there

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
which is seal off that little area there

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.380 
which is seal off that little area there
this<00:02:05.160> settles<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> coffee<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> make<00:02:06.360> sure

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this settles the coffee and make sure

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
this settles the coffee and make sure
that<00:02:06.720> it's<00:02:06.840> nice<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> have

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that it's nice and even and now I have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.240 
that it's nice and even and now I have
kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.940> loose<00:02:09.319> mass<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.619> coffee<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
kind of a loose mass of coffee in the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.270 
kind of a loose mass of coffee in the
basket<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.420> were<00:02:12.569> just<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.200> tamp<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.800> right

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
basket if I were just to tamp that right

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.059 
basket if I were just to tamp that right
now<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.940> would<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:15.810> uneven<00:02:16.470> bed<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.800> coffee

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
now it would be an uneven bed of coffee

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.370 
now it would be an uneven bed of coffee
there<00:02:17.520> are<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> uneven<00:02:18.180> density<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
there are the uneven density here and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.910 
there are the uneven density here and
here<00:02:20.160> here<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.810> such<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.440> water<00:02:22.650> would

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
here here and as such the water would

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.670 
here here and as such the water would
over<00:02:23.370> extract<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.240> less<00:02:24.510> dense<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.140> under

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
over extract the less dense and under

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.040 
over extract the less dense and under
extract<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.430> dense<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.600> what<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
extract the more dense so what I have to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.320 
extract the more dense so what I have to
do<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.410> redistribute<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.130> coffee<00:02:29.340> using<00:02:30.060> my

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
do is redistribute the coffee using my

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.620 
do is redistribute the coffee using my
index<00:02:30.660> finger

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
index finger

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.680

short and tastes like super bitter and

short and tastes like super bitter and
compact<00:03:20.500> then<00:03:21.340> you're<00:03:21.670> probably<00:03:21.790> extracting

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
compact then you're probably extracting

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.000 
compact then you're probably extracting
a<00:03:22.720> little<00:03:22.900> slow<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.620> adjust<00:03:23.710> your

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
a little slow so you can adjust your

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.100 
a little slow so you can adjust your
grind<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.520> little<00:03:24.790> coarser<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.840> ready<00:03:25.990> to

grind a little coarser and be ready to
go<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:32.050> what<00:03:32.140> I'm<00:03:32.230> done<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.560> should<00:03:32.650> look
