00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.990

 last word Chinese tourist beard how 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.549
 you feel you are creating by returning a

 place where your victim of stretches 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.049

 that is very far from your country there is a lot 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.569

 you feel your support because sometimes the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.010
 argentine afa metrics are little 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.170
 but I'm fine, well, well, really hard and 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.080
 interest as much as you feel having 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.690

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.769

 he is always with all his people when 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.370
 return back to what Manuel Lopez 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.190
 obviously it comes from a few never 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.319
 last two fights you think that you with 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.300
 your kind of aggressive design fight what 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.069
 you can never also 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 you are told to take it for 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.590
 in front and do a good job 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.330
 technically obviously he had clear in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.340
 these moments in this fight that you have 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.319
 but looking to the future if everything 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.840
 it goes well what are some plans that 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.080
 you have for the rest of the year or for 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080
 Your future 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.080
 and so we do not go so hard to the 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.220
 Argentina one week I will come to have 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.220
 back to 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:51.319
 we are here to wait as you see it 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.319
 how did you see the first fight very well 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.840
 that you think you will be more wins 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.220
 to convince the judges that he was 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.110
 the one who won and who is going to win this 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.959
 second fight that could do the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.910
 different and two ahead with a lot 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.549
 first but throw the strokes more clear and 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.230
 more mature and finally you also 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.720
 I wanted to ask a fight between other 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.959
 Argentine that happened recently was photo 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.090

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.770
 Argentinian appetizer that as a tourist 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.130
 fight and that you thought of acting 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.130
 of martínez 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.550
 I did a good job despite all 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:41.640
 his disappointments that he has I think that 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.640
 they are very works for the knee the hand 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.480
 finally in these moments we see a 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.000
 movement where the Argentine box like 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.460
 that is emerging is following 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.340
