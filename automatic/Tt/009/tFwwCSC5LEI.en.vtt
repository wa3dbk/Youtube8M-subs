my list this episode we are going to be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.710 
my list this episode we are going to be
testing<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.609> types<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.060> damage<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.570> can

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
testing what types of damage we can

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.599 
testing what types of damage we can
block<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.199> sword<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.830> always<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.520> are

block with a sword as always there are

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
what you can and can't block so I'm

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
what you can and can't block so I'm
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> test<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> different<00:00:25.619> types

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
going to test all of the different types

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
going to test all of the different types
of<00:00:25.980> damage<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> game<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
of damage that are in the game and the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
of damage that are in the game and the
test<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.980> will<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
test that we're going to do will be the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
test that we're going to do will be the
same<00:00:30.000> thing<00:00:30.269> twice<00:00:30.599> once<00:00:31.260> where<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.769> not

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
same thing twice once where we are not

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430 
same thing twice once where we are not
blocking<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.640> once<00:00:32.880> where<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.149> are<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.170> first

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
blocking and once where we are so first

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
blocking and once where we are so first
of<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> explosions<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:35.820> three

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
of all we have explosions there's three

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.490 
of all we have explosions there's three
different<00:00:36.180> types<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
different types that I can think of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760 
different types that I can think of
we<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.800> TNT<00:00:38.520> creepers<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> Gospels<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we have TNT creepers and Gospels and the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.040 
we have TNT creepers and Gospels and the
Gospels<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> fired<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
Gospels are going to be fired out of a

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
Gospels are going to be fired out of a
dispenser<00:00:43.910> then<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.390> fire<00:00:45.690> damage

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
dispenser then we also have fire damage

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.540 
dispenser then we also have fire damage
there's<00:00:46.350> three<00:00:46.530> different<00:00:46.800> types<00:00:47.010> again<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
there's three different types again like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
there's three different types again like
a<00:00:47.579> finger<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.379> walk<00:00:49.559> over

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
a finger for this so you can walk over

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.889 
a finger for this so you can walk over
fire<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.399> take<00:00:50.579> damage<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.570> set<00:00:51.870> on

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
fire and take damage you can get set on

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.200 
fire and take damage you can get set on
fire<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> blaze<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> then

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
fire we have the blaze for that and then

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.689 
fire we have the blaze for that and then
there's<00:00:54.449> lava<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:55.020> well<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.340> full

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there's lava as well then we have full

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
there's lava as well then we have full
damage<00:00:56.910> void<00:00:57.539> damage<00:00:58.020> which<00:00:58.469> may<00:00:59.010> seem

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
damage void damage which may seem

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
damage void damage which may seem
pointless<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> type<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.510> damage<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
pointless but it is a type of damage so

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
pointless but it is a type of damage so
we<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.260> test<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.129> then

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we will test that as well and then

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.780 
we will test that as well and then
drowning<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.719> suffocation<00:01:04.519> then<00:01:05.519> over<00:01:05.760> here

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
drowning and suffocation then over here

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.370 
drowning and suffocation then over here
you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.270> attacked<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.260> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you can get attacked in the game in this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
you can get attacked in the game in this
three<00:01:07.619> different<00:01:07.890> ways<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
three different ways like a think of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.109 
three different ways like a think of
apart<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> gospel<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.369> melee

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
apart from the gospel which was a melee

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.390 
apart from the gospel which was a melee
and<00:01:12.420> projection<00:01:13.049> we've<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> zombie<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and projection we've got the zombie and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
and projection we've got the zombie and
the<00:01:14.460> skeleton<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.810> also<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the skeleton for that and then also the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.749 
the skeleton for that and then also the
damage<00:01:16.439> potion<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.130> we're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> fire

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
damage potion which we're going to fire

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.780 
damage potion which we're going to fire
out<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> dispenser<00:01:18.950> then<00:01:19.950> last<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.610> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
out of a dispenser then last of all we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.429 
out of a dispenser then last of all we
have<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.420> types<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.869> damage<00:01:22.200> we've

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
have these other types of damage we've

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
have these other types of damage we've
got<00:01:22.560> poison<00:01:23.390> starvation<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> I'm<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
got poison starvation and I'm going to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200 
got poison starvation and I'm going to
use<00:01:25.080> MBT<00:01:25.590> edit<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.280> remove<00:01:26.640> my

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
use MBT edit for that to remove my

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.359 
use MBT edit for that to remove my
hunger<00:01:27.540> value<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> game<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.280> we

to<00:01:31.680> switch<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> snapshot<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> see

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to switch over to the snapshot and see

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
to switch over to the snapshot and see
if<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> block<00:01:34.409> wither<00:01:34.710> damage<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.549> I'm

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
if we can block wither damage so I'm

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.090 
if we can block wither damage so I'm
going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.479> testing<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.259> put

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
going to do all of this testing and put

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.890 
going to do all of this testing and put
it<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> time<00:01:38.729> lapse<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> skip

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it into a time lapse if you want to skip

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.719 
it into a time lapse if you want to skip
that<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.409> will<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.860> annotation<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that there will be an annotation on the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:38.469 
so here are the results these are based

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.319 
so here are the results these are based
on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.709> observations<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.609> were<00:03:39.730> making<00:03:39.909> during

on the observations I were making during

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.330 
on the observations I were making during
the<00:03:40.480> test<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:41.139> I've<00:03:41.349> had<00:03:41.500> all<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:41.980> checked

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the test so I've had all of this checked

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.129 
the test so I've had all of this checked
against<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.819> game<00:03:42.970> code<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:43.989> all

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.649 
against the game code and it's all
correct<00:03:44.409> so<00:03:44.829> let's<00:03:45.040> go<00:03:45.189> over<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.489> first<00:03:46.389> of<00:03:46.569> all

there's nothing in the game code that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.480 
there's nothing in the game code that

checks what sword type you have when

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.580 
checks what sword type you have when
blocking<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.120> also<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.080> does<00:04:38.289> no<00:04:38.560> damage

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
blocking and also it does no damage

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.010

whatsoever<00:04:39.099> to<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.789> sword<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.419> you<00:04:40.479> saw<00:04:40.780> in

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
whatsoever to the sword so you saw in

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.480 
whatsoever to the sword so you saw in
the<00:04:41.110> test<00:04:41.380> there<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.860> I<00:04:41.889> never<00:04:42.099> took<00:04:42.280> any

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
the test there that I never took any

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.909 
the test there that I never took any
durability<00:04:43.090> on<00:04:43.270> my<00:04:43.930> sword<00:04:44.199> when<00:04:44.409> doing<00:04:44.740> that

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
durability on my sword when doing that

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.159 
durability on my sword when doing that
so<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.940> amount<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.270> damage<00:04:46.599> that<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.900> blocked

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
so the amount of damage that is blocked

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.200 
so the amount of damage that is blocked
by<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.409> sword<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.039> half<00:04:48.340> that's<00:04:48.729> if<00:04:49.000> we're

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
by a sword is half that's if we're

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.240 
by a sword is half that's if we're
dealing<00:04:49.539> with<00:04:49.570> whole<00:04:49.930> hearts<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:50.650> if

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
dealing with whole hearts so if

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.710 
dealing with whole hearts so if
something<00:04:51.699> does<00:04:51.909> two<00:04:52.150> hearts<00:04:52.449> of<00:04:52.570> damage

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
something does two hearts of damage

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.719 
something does two hearts of damage
you're<00:04:53.500> going<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.740> block<00:04:53.919> it<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.280> it's<00:04:54.550> going

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
you're going to block it and it's going

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.339 
you're going to block it and it's going
to<00:04:54.789> do<00:04:54.909> one<00:04:55.150> if<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.479> does<00:04:55.630> free<00:04:55.960> hearts<00:04:56.229> of

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
to do one if it does free hearts of

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.110 
to do one if it does free hearts of
damage<00:04:56.500> you'll<00:04:57.370> block<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:57.880> there<00:04:58.030> will

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
damage you'll block it in there will

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.270 
damage you'll block it in there will
only<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.510> one<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.260> half<00:04:59.500> now<00:04:59.919> if<00:05:00.099> we're

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
only do one and a half now if we're

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.710 
only do one and a half now if we're
dealing<00:05:00.400> with<00:05:00.639> something<00:05:00.849> that<00:05:01.030> has<00:05:01.300> half<00:05:01.570> a

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
dealing with something that has half a

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.420 
dealing with something that has half a
heart<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.199> half<00:05:02.409> a<00:05:02.590> heart<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:02.860> never<00:05:03.099> blocked

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
heart that half a heart is never blocked

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.600 
heart that half a heart is never blocked
so<00:05:04.270> if<00:05:04.539> we<00:05:04.690> were<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.990> receive<00:05:05.560> four<00:05:06.190> hearts<00:05:06.490> of

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
so if we were to receive four hearts of

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.939 
so if we were to receive four hearts of
damage<00:05:06.759> which<00:05:07.090> block<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.479> take<00:05:07.720> two<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.259> then

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
damage which block it take two and then

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.860 
damage which block it take two and then
if<00:05:09.190> it<00:05:09.340> was<00:05:09.520> four<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.060> half<00:05:10.240> we<00:05:10.509> would<00:05:10.599> block

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
if it was four and a half we would block

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.659 
if it was four and a half we would block
it<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.229> take<00:05:11.680> two<00:05:11.919> and<00:05:12.039> a<00:05:12.070> half<00:05:12.220> hearts<00:05:12.550> of

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
it and take two and a half hearts of

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.540 
it and take two and a half hearts of
damage<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.259> we<00:05:14.259> now<00:05:14.650> know<00:05:14.860> what<00:05:15.039> types<00:05:15.340> of

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
damage so we now know what types of

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.070 
damage so we now know what types of
damage<00:05:15.849> can<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.270> can't<00:05:16.450> be<00:05:16.570> blocked<00:05:16.750> by<00:05:17.020> the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
damage can and can't be blocked by the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.930 
damage can and can't be blocked by the
sword<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.979> if<00:05:18.099> anyone<00:05:18.400> ever<00:05:18.580> tells<00:05:18.789> you
