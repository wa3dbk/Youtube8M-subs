00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 always a goal for me that in short 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.539
 I started recently then today 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 defeat bowser in the gods level 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 I don't even remember underground 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 what was the level of gods called? 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
 underground then the net excellent of the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.629
 I slip into the precious mountain and I have you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 understand a sea ​​we go then let's see 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 then of course guys here we should 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 take the 8 with the roses 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.270
 of course because it is the title is well 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 clear in short we see a little see a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.530
 let's see a little bit about that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.170
 you had to use your eyes because this 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.479
 one must use by force and or by discovering the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 coins and sorry sorry if there are any 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.869
 forget so much we do 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.659
 abandons and we go immediately to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.200
 take the eyes then let's go with 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.210
 mario here's here baiocchi guys here lo 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 shah ghazi in the sea gate because 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 you know that when you go with marin in the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.750
 in short, his door will change with the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.759
 eyes and the same is true with luigi 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 wario in short if you go to the door of 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.130
 lee lewis 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.759
 when you have him he will always change us 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.439
 with the eyes and we go there by many 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.450
 refreshment touch the with the osci e 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.040
 then we go immediately to firth 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 so why did I want a serious show 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.940
 now you will not understand immediately 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.690
 if you see that it is lard we go in 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.600
 this bay here the boys jump 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.330
 very little if they are remembered 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 let's see that this red coin is 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.710
 in short, in an ice cube and then 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.780
 we will have to use the aussie precisely for 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.060
 let's take a leap here you see 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.010
 this fire with the boys we just that 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.850
 we swallow it so we take it with the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 language as always went there in that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.990
 something ice always with it 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.670
 same button spit fire you will see 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.410
 you will melt ice and therefore nothing 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.209
 you will take a coin the same thing 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.550
 happens when you take flower powers 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.410
 today is he becomes practically 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 becomes yoshi dragon we say fire-breathing e 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.320
 so let's see a little bit 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.850
 let's see if I had not seen this 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.800
 enemy let's see where we can 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.810
 go to get the other coins then 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.450
 will naturally be a bomb we talk 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.459
 he tells us all where he has to 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.959
 find the coins then 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.550
 let us go down this valley in this field 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.590
 let's see if you want one 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.209
 shortcut you can just jump in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.250
 below at least it would do much much more 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.440
 fast choose we have already found 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.550
 to the bomb with a naturally next 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.420
 red coin 15 we talk and see a little 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.489
 let's try to memorize them you go 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.890
 well let's see a little bit now 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.220
 where we can find it let's see 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.220
 we see that here there is a one thing 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.050
 a platform to send us now belen 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.740
 well picture this guy here and there 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.380
 we will go 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.340
 later with a ploy girls there 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.930
 we will go 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.620
 let's see a little that a coin should 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.720
 being here me the perfect memory here it is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.660
 here go you go perfect then we choose 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.690
 then we go down we go down from this other one 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.690
 part 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.750
 of course we avoid with crazy snow 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.000
 that always break then we have them 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.900
 also find another alcohol to you in 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.790
 this broken bridge let's see if it is here 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.080
 here the staff guys from where it will come out 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.330
 the star when we get all the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.670
 protect the coins to those we remember 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.240
 in short, that is perfect there 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.680
 let's jump in the faith in the snow 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.630
 and then there should be another currency 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.610
 red breaks this I remembered 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.490
 no because in short, I remembered it and gave it 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.810
 when I played here there is another one 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.220
 here it is perfect and 6 that is missing two 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
 in short, it seemed to me more difficult 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.230
 take the 8 coins you can find it there 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.700
 another perfect but I thought I was falling 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.370
 they are kids because they really are 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.050
 what bad luck then we see another one here 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.009
 here we give him that the group has come down 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.599
 now we will use it precisely 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.490
 to force why we should go in 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.680
 that platform lee 15 dances etc. 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.990
 so much so now you know what he says 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.339
 we have been there at least 20 thousand times 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.580
 in short, we let hold on to 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:47.119
 wolf so it's enough that in short but precisely 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.259
 of others you have and will take you to altitude 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:55.639
 let's see now, however, where to land 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:58.460
 we have a little yes yes I think so that it was 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.529
 there if I'm not mistaken landing by 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.930
 fortune is other girl in faith 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.520
 in the beautiful snow if I don't even know 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.319
 I, like I did, still take 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.689
 this is an act for this always 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.639
 comfortable the same thing the same thing as 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.099
 first, the aussies take the fire 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.289
 what are you doing here that dissolves the 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.509
 ice to take the last last one 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.819
 perfect coin here it is guys 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.449
 card of course will appear where said 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.729
 before 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.490
 then let's see if we take the same 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.050
 in short, the owl to go faster but 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.330
 no no you don't need taste because to which 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.039
 close it seems to me if I can 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.809
 frame well etc. and so on by 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.740
 naturally we pass sky points 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:39.979
 tension snowmen naturally 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.399
 that make a bad bojan but it doesn't matter 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.659
 Go 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.039
 we arrived so no use 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.849
 not even take the group in fact has 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:49.039
 made long jump 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.979
 we made it a perfect star 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.180
 number 30 boys in the next episode 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.860
 we will defeat boozer we will defeat 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.839
 boozer and immediately after defeating 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.370
 power in short we will end naturally 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.309
 the levels of mountain refreshment are 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.839
 how many remained and then 12 remained 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:05.779
 let's go fast we'll get him 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:08.419
 save and continue to vote for us very much 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.889
 in other words, it has recovered 30 stars now 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.149
 then the front doors with the big star 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.099
 but before proceeding 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.870
 let's check some things you saved 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.519
 poor luigi frightened you made one 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.469
 crash on the two columns I know that bono 

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:20.779
 he has abandoned the sea and is under the earth 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.209
 until the mess you finally put it 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:26.059
 the ropes as you got him 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:28.219
 having said the game he is taking one 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:29.889
 little idea why not go to 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.749
 take luigi 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.389
 in short, before going, defeat 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.340
 bowser the crash on the two columns 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.719
 in short, he was referring to something that makes it 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.249
 the problem remains one thing 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:44.319
 shit so yes but in short gec 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:46.389
 I will dedicate a video to a kind of video 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.439
 extra short for this thing 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.050
 we should do in the next episode 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:52.360
 so wait anxiously then from 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.900
 djerba and three for a day is all bye 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.900
