00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
here we have the revamped version which

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.160 
here we have the revamped version which
is<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> different<00:00:26.430> shatter<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
is a different shatter you can see it is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.820 
is a different shatter you can see it is
actually<00:00:28.519> this<00:00:29.519> time<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:30.060> textured<00:00:30.689> body<00:00:30.960> which

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
actually this time a textured body which

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.790 
actually this time a textured body which
is<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.399> barely<00:00:32.669> visible<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:34.020> some<00:00:34.440> kind<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
is just barely visible with some kind of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.240 
is just barely visible with some kind of
smoke<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> glowy<00:00:36.000> eyes<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> thing<00:00:37.980> about

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
smoke and glowy eyes so the thing about

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
smoke and glowy eyes so the thing about
the<00:00:38.489> eyes<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.739> just

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the eyes is that they are not just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.840 
the eyes is that they are not just
eyeballs<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.680> trail<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
eyeballs but they have this trail that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.229 
eyeballs but they have this trail that
is<00:00:45.059> um<00:00:45.590> actually<00:00:46.590> coming<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> Draugr

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
is um actually coming from the Draugr

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.610 
is um actually coming from the Draugr
eyes<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:51.020> makes<00:00:52.020> everything<00:00:52.440> look

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
eyes and so on and makes everything look

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.850 
eyes and so on and makes everything look
kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> spooky<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.390> problem<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
kind of spooky the problem is if the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.389 
kind of spooky the problem is if the
model<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.020> transparent<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.010> weather

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
model is transparent then in weather

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.650 
model is transparent then in weather
looks<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> bug<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.660> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
looks like a bug if there is this this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
looks like a bug if there is this this
trail<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> eyes<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
trail from the eyes that is just

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.130 
trail from the eyes that is just
hovering<00:01:06.990> inside<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> head<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.820> ghost

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
hovering inside of the head of the ghost

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
hovering inside of the head of the ghost
so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> think<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.430> rather<00:01:11.880> real

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so I think that has to be rather real

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
so I think that has to be rather real
eyeball<00:01:13.260> without<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.010> trail<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.820> glowing

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
eyeball without the trail just glowing

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.200 
eyeball without the trail just glowing
or<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.020> should<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.350> removed<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.189> general<00:01:17.880> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
or it should be removed in general and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
or it should be removed in general and
be<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.430> empty<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.659> say<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.259> those

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
be just empty so you can say that those

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.940 
be just empty so you can say that those
are<00:01:23.009> looking<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.150> spooky<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.530> eyes<00:01:25.710> are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
are looking more spooky and the eyes are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.249 
are looking more spooky and the eyes are
doing<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:26.850> good<00:01:27.090> job<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
doing actually pretty good job with that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.640 
doing actually pretty good job with that
so<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.640> why<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.140> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so that's why I think that it is just

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.069 
so that's why I think that it is just
while<00:01:32.250> still<00:01:32.579> standing<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
while still standing that it has this

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
while still standing that it has this
little<00:01:34.140> problem<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
little problem and I think that the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.460 
little problem and I think that the
actual<00:01:37.729> chatter<00:01:38.729> shouldn't<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.079> plain

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
actual chatter shouldn't be just plain

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.249 
actual chatter shouldn't be just plain
because<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> looks<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.329> weird<00:01:42.659> but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because it looks a little bit weird but

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
because it looks a little bit weird but
still<00:01:43.860> having<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.909> glow<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> far

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
still having a little glow on it so far

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
still having a little glow on it so far
from<00:01:47.909> afar<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.540> looking<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> far<00:01:49.860> from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
from afar it's looking and so far from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.639 
from afar it's looking and so far from
afar<00:01:50.340> those<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.240> looking<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.960> but

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
afar those are looking pretty good but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
afar those are looking pretty good but
if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.070> closer<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
if you get closer you just see from the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
if you get closer you just see from the
shatter<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> actual<00:01:55.290> texture<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
shatter that it's the actual texture and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.280 
shatter that it's the actual texture and
just<00:01:57.000> adding<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> glow

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just adding this little bit of glow

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
just adding this little bit of glow
would<00:01:58.560> make<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.460> better<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.030> my

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
would make it really better in my

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
would make it really better in my
opinion<00:02:00.240> course<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.469> spooky

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
opinion course there are more spooky

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
opinion course there are more spooky
things<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> could<00:02:02.729> aunt<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.600> just

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
things that you could aunt like just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.840 
things that you could aunt like just
having<00:02:04.140> half<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.530> body<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> problem<00:02:05.729> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
having half a body but the problem is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.950 
having half a body but the problem is
that<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
