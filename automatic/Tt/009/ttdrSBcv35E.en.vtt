every evening after school I used to

early<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.250> sit<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> bench<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.480> some

early I sit at the bench for are some
tweezers<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> play<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.100> making<00:00:50.430> patterns<00:00:50.670> and

tweezers and play at making patterns and
lines<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.690> watch<00:00:51.870> parts<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.360> pretty

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
lines with watch parts so that's pretty

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.990 
lines with watch parts so that's pretty
much<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> learned<00:00:58.410> watchmaking<00:00:59.309> through

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

assemble a movement at production like
this<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:48.979> whereas<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.280> easily<00:01:50.490> spend<00:01:50.850> a

often we assemble and disassemble the

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.710 
often we assemble and disassemble the
same<00:01:57.390> piece<00:01:57.659> 10<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.470> 20<00:01:59.159> times<00:01:59.630> repeating<00:02:00.630> the
