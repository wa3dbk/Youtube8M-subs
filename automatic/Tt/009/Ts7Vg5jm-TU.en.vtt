00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello all my good I'll start a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.930
 new video series 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.639
 now with some quick prescriptions 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 what I like to do here at home 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 Good to begin, let's make a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 oatmeal biscuit and honey very cheap 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.300
 very easy to do and reminiscent of that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.300
 famous sold in supermarket 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.010
 the odor 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.190
 first i put the vÃ©ia 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.239
 in the case of wheat flour I like 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.470
 put half flour is normal and half 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.120
 integral 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.150
 not use all full because integrated 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.720
 a little heavier and sling-bound 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:13.630
 than the white flour 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.630
 the sugar adds 6 baking powder 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.259
 the mixture well the dry material 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.340
 there begins to put the egg a honey 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:40.939
 and I also put a tablespoon of 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:44.469
 melted butter or oil can be a 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.469
 sunflower oil 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.150
 at first but appears a bit dry 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.270
 but as you move your own 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.390
 heat of the hand and melts the sugar and honey 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 they incorporate the dough if the dough remains 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 a little dry yet you can 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.080
 add a little more butter or 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.380
 a little more honey in person 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.330
 I prefer a little more honey 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.940
 If the dough becomes very moist you can 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 add a little more flour 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 wheat 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.989
 the consistency we seek is one that 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.030
 leaves Brasilia a little cleaner 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.470
 remembering the dough a little today 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 pastry 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 although she will be sticking 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.050
 a little bit so much in the bowl with everything in the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.920
 hands to model the biscuits you can 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 use a greased beaker or you can 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 make their own hands take one 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.810
 a little 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.239
 make a ball in the palm of your hand and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.180
 after 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.890
 Flatten it flatten the ball to do 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.510
 one more or less a biscuit 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.930
 five millimeters thick 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:10.549
 in this magical case is before you start 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.709
 model wash hands and a splint with 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.709
 oil or butter 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.110
 not to stick to the shape I like 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.780
 use butter paper 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.480
 because in addition to facilitating the cleaning of the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.280
 way later on is if you want to do more 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.710
 a greater amount of biscuits 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.170
 I can just take that role. 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.150
 still in the hot form I come back with a paper 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.230
 new and put the biscuit do not need 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.370
 wait to cool the training time 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.130
 Oven can vary between 15 and 20 minutes 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.940
 at 150 degrees 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 depends a little on your oven 1 point 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.640
 to remove from the oven is when it 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.060
 golden and yet cuddly he just 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.160
 crisp when cool 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.010
 some can see the crunchy cuts by 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.400
 it was cuddly inside a consistency 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.360
 very good the taste of honey stays very 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.820
 evident 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.640
 with this series of videos in honor of 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.799
 My mother used to say that empty bag 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.010
 does not stand up 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.230
 work is good but eating is better still 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.810
 I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 We'll be back soon with more videos. 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.520
 A hug to everyone and until next time 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.710
 to 1
