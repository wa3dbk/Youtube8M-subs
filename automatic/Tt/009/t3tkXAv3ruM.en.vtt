00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 video tutorial we will see how to build a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 terrarium for all types of reptiles 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.679
 easy way and the most important thing we 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 It will come out very cheap and is tested 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 of leaks the only materials that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.630
 will be needed are the following two 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.140
 boards of agglomerated wood of about 40 x 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.509
 60 centimeters 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.699
 eight sticks of sixty centimeters of 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.349
 high and the width that you want 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.150
 I recommend more than four times four 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.790
 centimeters thick 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 and another four for the two of 60 and the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 another two of 40 centimeters in length 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.160
 as I have already told you with the width that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.160
 you wish 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 great roll of mosquito net the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.520
 resistant hinges 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.800
 and four little methacrylate plates 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.989
 thickness and the color they want should 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.329
 measure the first two 60 x 20 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.790
 centimeters and the other 2 40 x 20 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.559
 centimeters 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.500
 now I will explain how to mount it 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.239
 all attentive the first thing they should 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.460
 to do is take the lower table of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 agglomerated and put the sticks of this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.560
 way then they use the 4 sticks that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.300
 They were identified above and apart 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.350
 place horizontally such 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.350
 so that they remain that way 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.220
 if they want in the back they can 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.740
 put an agglomerate table for 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.640
 reinforce the structure this should measure 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.260
 60 x 60 centimeters then it covers all 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.510
 the structure minus the top part 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.729
 of mosquito net if possible 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.740
 metal to avoid oxidation is and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.550
 we adjust it with Velcro clips 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.260
 thumbtacks nails or whatever they have on hand 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.660
 the fourth step would be to place 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.520
 60 x 20 methacrylate sheets 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.470
 centimeters at the bottom of the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.810
 terrarium with this we will avoid that it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.270
 escape insects substrate or water that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.160
 we spray our reptile and to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.470
 finish the hinges are placed 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.570
 screwed to the lid and it is placed 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.380
 rope or insulating tape under the edge of 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.509
 the cover 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.200
 equally to prevent leakage of everything 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.090
 good guy this is all friends I hope 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.429
 that they have liked and that it serves them 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 help all mine was like that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.310
 but my sister put a duck and screwed it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.440
 whole xd xd please subscribe 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.239
 a recommendation of mine is that they are read 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.239
 all joints with silicone
