for<00:00:00.719> years<00:00:00.989> mothers<00:00:01.530> have<00:00:01.709> used<00:00:01.949> ultrasound

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
for years mothers have used ultrasound

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.030 
for years mothers have used ultrasound
technology<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.689> see<00:00:03.870> their<00:00:04.049> unborn<00:00:04.560> babies

wasn't happy with a sagging skin on her
face<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> first<00:00:27.570> place<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
face I think it's the first place that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
face I think it's the first place that
women<00:00:28.740> show<00:00:29.220> their<00:00:29.609> age<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.330> gravity

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
women show their age you know gravity

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
women show their age you know gravity
and<00:00:31.050> all<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.090> that<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> first

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and all of that so that was the first

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
and all of that so that was the first
place<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.739> concerned<00:00:35.219> about<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
place that I was concerned about it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
place that I was concerned about it
Lorraine<00:00:35.969> decided<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.750> time<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
Lorraine decided it was time for a

tighten and lift facial skin it takes

tighten and lift facial skin it takes
about<00:00:55.079> 30<00:00:55.410> minutes<00:00:55.590> per<00:00:56.129> treatment<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
about 30 minutes per treatment the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
about 30 minutes per treatment the
device<00:00:59.129> creates<00:00:59.670> heat<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.510> moved<00:01:00.809> over

device creates heat and is moved over
the<00:01:01.260> area's<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> patient<00:01:02.399> wants<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> improve

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the area's the patient wants to improve

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
the area's the patient wants to improve
benefits<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.439> similar<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> face<00:01:05.369> lift<00:01:05.729> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
benefits are similar to a face lift but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.710 
benefits are similar to a face lift but
without<00:01:06.689> surgery<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:08.010> allows<00:01:08.340> us<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.600> an

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
without surgery it allows us to get an

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.760 
without surgery it allows us to get an
ultrasound<00:01:09.960> picture<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.850> skin<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ultrasound picture of the skin so that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
ultrasound picture of the skin so that
we<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.240> depth<00:01:15.750> we

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
we can look and see it what depth we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
we can look and see it what depth we
really<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> deliver<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.820> energy<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
really want to deliver the energy and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.859 
really want to deliver the energy and
then<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.650> use<00:01:20.040> an<00:01:20.340> appropriate<00:01:20.939> delivery

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
then we can use an appropriate delivery

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
then we can use an appropriate delivery
device<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.950> will<00:01:23.130> deliver<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.790> heat

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
device that will deliver the heat

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.570 
device that will deliver the heat
precisely<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> area<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
precisely to the area that we want the
