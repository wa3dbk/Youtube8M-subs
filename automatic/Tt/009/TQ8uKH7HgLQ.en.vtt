00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
still really don't use it all that much

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.590 
still really don't use it all that much
just<00:01:45.490> because<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.579> lousy<00:01:48.759> easier<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.479> put

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
did here when I got this the whole was

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.029 
did here when I got this the whole was
this<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.490> regular<00:02:06.789> hole<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:08.259> the

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
this is the the regular hole but the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.410 
this is the the regular hole but the
plug<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:10.390> here

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
plug right here

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.680 
plug right here
which<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.110> some<00:02:13.140> light<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:14.390> wouldn't<00:02:15.390> fit

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
which in some light here wouldn't fit

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.160 
which in some light here wouldn't fit
very<00:02:15.930> well<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:17.400> too<00:02:17.640> too<00:02:18.569> small<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
very well it was too too small so the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.660 
very well it was too too small so the
plug<00:02:19.350> would<00:02:19.440> constantly<00:02:19.890> fall<00:02:20.069> out<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
plug would constantly fall out so the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.960 
plug would constantly fall out so the
whole<00:02:20.870> point<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.020> being<00:02:22.530> secured<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.370> really

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
whole point of being secured it really

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.240 
whole point of being secured it really
didn't<00:02:24.150> work<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> had<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.630 
I've done to the bottom is actually have
drilled<00:02:49.739> out<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.340> hole<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.630> bottom<00:02:52.640> because

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
drilled out a hole on the bottom because

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.740 
drilled out a hole on the bottom because
when<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.720> put<00:02:54.989> crickets<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:56.690> by<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
when you put crickets in here by the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.570 
when you put crickets in here by the
time<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.320> always<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.370> four

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
time you always have you know your four

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.759 
time you always have you know your four
or<00:02:59.640> five<00:02:59.850> scrag<00:03:00.269> lers<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.840> don't<00:03:01.530> come<00:03:01.739> out

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
or five scrag lers that don't come out

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.140 
or five scrag lers that don't come out
of<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> bag<00:03:02.690> or<00:03:03.739> don't<00:03:04.739> go<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:06.000> right

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
of the bag or don't go in there right

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.270 
of the bag or don't go in there right
away<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.530> all<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.650> rest<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.980> crickets

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
away and all the rest of the crickets

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.680 
away and all the rest of the crickets
that<00:03:08.340> are<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> there<00:03:08.700> automatically<00:03:09.450> start

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
that are in there automatically start

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.780 
that are in there automatically start
climbing<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.320> thing<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:11.100> pain

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
climbing out of this thing it's a pain

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.080 
climbing out of this thing it's a pain
in<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.000> butt<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.459> thinking<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:15.060> if

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
in the butt so what I was thinking is if

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.630 
in the butt so what I was thinking is if
I<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.630> leave<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.290> camera<00:03:16.739> on<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.459> bottom

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I can leave the camera on the bottom

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.120 
I can leave the camera on the bottom
part<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.650> give<00:03:19.860> me<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.010> Ledge<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.570> I

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
part and give me a Ledge like that I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.910 
part and give me a Ledge like that I
could<00:03:23.130> dump<00:03:23.310> my<00:03:23.430> crickets<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.739> all

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
could dump my crickets right in and all

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.069 
could dump my crickets right in and all
this<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.900> cat<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:29.600> don't<00:03:30.600> even<00:03:30.870> remember

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
this is is a cat I don't even remember

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.370 
this is is a cat I don't even remember
what<00:03:31.410> it's<00:03:31.590> for<00:03:31.769> right<00:03:32.040> here<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:33.630> basically

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
what it's for right here I basically

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.860 
what it's for right here I basically
just<00:03:34.640> do<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.730> off<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.420> I've<00:03:36.570> wrapped

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
just do it off and I've wrapped

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.449 
just do it off and I've wrapped
electrical<00:03:37.380> tape<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.620> make<00:03:37.920> sure<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.250> this

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
electrical tape to make sure that this

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.210 
electrical tape to make sure that this
seals<00:03:39.079> somewhat<00:03:40.079> better<00:03:40.230> than<00:03:40.320> what<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.680> you

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
seals somewhat better than what it you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.030 
seals somewhat better than what it you
know<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.549> sitting<00:03:42.150> there<00:03:42.799> basically<00:03:43.799> I

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
know just sitting there basically I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.259 
know just sitting there basically I
would<00:03:44.269> dump<00:03:45.269> my<00:03:45.390> crickets<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:51.000> cap

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
would dump my crickets in there this cap

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.430 
would dump my crickets in there this cap
on<00:03:51.860> bring<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:52.950> over<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.160> need<00:03:53.870> set<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> down<00:03:54.989> in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
on bring it over I need set it down in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.580 
on bring it over I need set it down in
the<00:03:55.620> tank<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.810> pull<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> plug<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:01.200> as<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
the tank and pull the plug but as I

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.770 
the tank and pull the plug but as I
noticed<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.579> understand<00:04:03.239> it's

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
noticed you know I understand it's

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.550 
noticed you know I understand it's
supposed<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.650> simulate<00:04:05.600> natural<00:04:06.600> feeding

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
supposed to simulate natural feeding

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.789 
supposed to simulate natural feeding
behavior<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:09.090> I've<00:04:09.570> had<00:04:09.810> more<00:04:09.959> crickets<00:04:10.560> die

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
behavior but I've had more crickets die

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.740
