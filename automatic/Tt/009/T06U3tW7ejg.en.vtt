00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Britannia it's a glorious game for three

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
Britannia it's a glorious game for three
to<00:00:41.790> five<00:00:42.180> players<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.290> mostly<00:00:43.800> played<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.160> with

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to five players I mostly played it with

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.459 
to five players I mostly played it with
four<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> optimal<00:00:45.690> amount<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:47.270> as

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
four which is the optimal amount and as

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.790 
four which is the optimal amount and as
the<00:00:49.469> title<00:00:49.920> suggests<00:00:50.100> its<00:00:51.289> historical<00:00:52.289> game

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the title suggests its historical game

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
the title suggests its historical game
which<00:00:53.340> follows<00:00:54.530> Britain<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> Roman

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
which follows Britain from the Roman

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
which follows Britain from the Roman
invasion<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.609> Norman<00:00:59.609> invasion<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.449> then

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
invasion to the Norman invasion and then

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.900 
invasion to the Norman invasion and then
they<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:00.870> different<00:01:01.440> factions<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
they take different factions it's a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.240 
they take different factions it's a
strategy<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.140> obviously<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
strategy game as well and obviously I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.789 
strategy game as well and obviously I
might<00:01:09.000> mention<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> past<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
might mention this in the past but the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
might mention this in the past but the
reason<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.369> interested<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.909> British

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
reason I'm so interested in British

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
reason I'm so interested in British
history<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:13.170> stems<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> fact

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
history actually stems from the fact

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.200 
history actually stems from the fact
that<00:01:15.170> British<00:01:16.170> authors<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.640> write<00:01:18.090> about

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that British authors like to write about

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
that British authors like to write about
bridge<00:01:18.750> history<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.350> Roman<00:01:19.770> history<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
bridge history or Roman history so you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.870 
bridge history or Roman history so you
have<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> choose<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.390> those<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> since

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
have to choose from those two and since

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.850 
have to choose from those two and since
Swedish<00:01:24.479> isn't<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> big<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> language<00:01:25.650> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
Swedish isn't that big of a language I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
Swedish isn't that big of a language I
mainly<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> pick<00:01:26.790> books<00:01:27.030> written<00:01:27.420> in

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
mainly have to pick books written in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.620 
mainly have to pick books written in
English<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:30.150> led<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.450> into

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
English so that's what led me into

so you do a really cool game to start
strong<00:02:36.709> some<00:02:37.130> history<00:02:37.489> perfect<00:02:38.480> for<00:02:38.630> me<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.200> if

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
strong some history perfect for me so if

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.699 
strong some history perfect for me so if
you<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:40.000> gather<00:02:41.000> for<00:02:41.930> true<00:02:42.200> friends<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
you have gather for true friends and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.039 
you have gather for true friends and
then<00:02:44.239> go<00:02:44.450> time<00:02:44.720> light<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:46.450> my<00:02:47.450> best

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
then go time light like my best

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.410 
then go time light like my best
recommendation<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.140> deeper

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
recommendation for a a bit of a deeper

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.449 
recommendation for a a bit of a deeper
bore<00:02:53.420> game<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.870> know<00:02:54.170> risk<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:55.010> quite<00:02:55.250> popular

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
bore game I know risk it's quite popular

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.990 
bore game I know risk it's quite popular
but<00:02:55.819> that's<00:02:55.970> too<00:02:56.720> much<00:02:57.110> luck<00:02:57.549> little<00:02:58.549> strategy

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
but that's too much luck little strategy

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.199 
but that's too much luck little strategy
not<00:02:59.239> enough<00:02:59.569> historical<00:03:00.230> depth<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.310> this

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
not enough historical depth so this

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.150 
not enough historical depth so this
actually<00:03:02.989> gives<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.290> good<00:03:03.410> history<00:03:03.769> lesson<00:03:04.099> as

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
actually gives a good history lesson as

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.509 
actually gives a good history lesson as
well<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:04.849> getting<00:03:05.150> only<00:03:05.330> different

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
well because we getting only different

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.589 
well because we getting only different
peoples<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:07.750> invaded<00:03:08.750> Britain<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.500> forth<00:03:10.599> so
