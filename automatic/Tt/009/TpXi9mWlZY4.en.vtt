00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
land is in the second rank and so you

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.400 
land is in the second rank and so you
can't<00:00:24.240> even<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:24.570> even<00:00:24.810> attack<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.320> if

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.990 
can't even really even attack it if
you're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> fight<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:25.980> unit<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.880> have

to go and wipe up the unit or kill

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.570 
to go and wipe up the unit or kill
enough<00:00:28.680> they<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> rear<00:00:29.490> or

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
enough they can get from the rear or

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950 
enough they can get from the rear or
something<00:00:29.910> before<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.330> even<00:00:30.420> attack<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
something before it can even attack this

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
something before it can even attack this
character<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.439> completely<00:00:32.009> protected<00:00:32.940> as

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
character is completely protected as

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.450 
character is completely protected as
opposed<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> saying<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> regular<00:00:34.920> level<00:00:35.130> for

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
opposed to saying a regular level for

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.160 
opposed to saying a regular level for
mage<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:36.030> often<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> front<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.050> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
mage that's often the front and you can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
mage that's often the front and you can
just<00:00:37.290> charge<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.920> kill<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.670> combat

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
just charge it and kill it in combat

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.100 
just charge it and kill it in combat
with<00:00:39.090> ease<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.500> guess<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> always<00:00:42.120> sort

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
with ease so I guess this is always sort

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
with ease so I guess this is always sort
of<00:00:43.200> possible<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.910> eighth<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.570> way

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of possible but now in eighth the way

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.389 
of possible but now in eighth the way
that<00:00:45.899> things<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.350> changed<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.190> lot

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that things have changed this is a lot

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.150 
that things have changed this is a lot
more<00:00:47.430> viable<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.379> powerful<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
more viable and can be very powerful and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
more viable and can be very powerful and
to<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> main<00:00:52.140> rule<00:00:52.410> that's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to get right to it the main rule that's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.209 
to get right to it the main rule that's
going<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.590> you<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.860> any

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
going on here is that if you have any

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.080 
going on here is that if you have any
characters<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.559> command<00:00:58.559> units<00:00:59.010> models<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
characters or command units models in

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.639 
characters or command units models in
your<00:01:00.210> unit<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> front

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
your unit they have to go to the front

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
your unit they have to go to the front
rank<00:01:02.010> what's<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.520> front<00:01:02.879> rank<00:01:03.120> became

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
rank what's that front rank became

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
rank what's that front rank became
becomes<00:01:03.989> full<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.250> fall<00:01:05.489> back<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
becomes full they can then fall back to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
becomes full they can then fall back to
the<00:01:06.030> second<00:01:06.570> rank<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.799> seventh<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> know

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the second rank now in seventh you know

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.410 
the second rank now in seventh you know
there<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> lot<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> because

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
there was a lot of use to this because

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
there was a lot of use to this because
that<00:01:12.420> didn't<00:01:12.810> give<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.080> mages<00:01:13.350> line<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that didn't give your mages line of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
that didn't give your mages line of
sight<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:15.030> attack<00:01:15.150> things<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.960> this

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sight they could attack things like this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.770 
sight they could attack things like this
but<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.340> true<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.330> sight<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
but now we have true line of sight and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
but now we have true line of sight and
models<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> second<00:01:20.189> rank<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.580> even

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
models in the second rank can even

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.450 
models in the second rank can even
attack<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.930> let's<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.740> best-case

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
attack so let's go to the best-case

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
attack so let's go to the best-case
scenario<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
scenario here and that's with the the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
scenario here and that's with the the
ogres<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> are<00:01:27.509> these

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
ogres actually because if you are these

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
ogres actually because if you are these
monstrous<00:01:28.530> infantry<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.400> still<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.790> three

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
monstrous infantry you still get three

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390 
monstrous infantry you still get three
attacks<00:01:30.420> even<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> second<00:01:31.439> rank<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
attacks even from the second rank and so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.010 
attacks even from the second rank and so
what<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> usually<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.600> something

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
what you can usually do is put something

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
what you can usually do is put something
like<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.500> your<00:01:34.710> butchers<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.189> your

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
like your your butchers or your

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
like your your butchers or your
slaughter<00:01:35.820> masters<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> second<00:01:36.930> rank<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
slaughter masters in the second rank and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
slaughter masters in the second rank and
that's<00:01:38.220> even<00:01:38.520> easier<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's even easier because now that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
that's even easier because now that
ranks<00:01:39.990> only<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> three<00:01:41.130> models<00:01:41.490> wide
