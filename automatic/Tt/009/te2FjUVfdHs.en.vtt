way too many times so I was pretty
stoked<00:01:49.270> about<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.840> idea<00:01:50.080> of<00:01:50.200> doing<00:01:50.320> this<00:01:50.590> one

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
stoked about the idea of doing this one

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.690 
stoked about the idea of doing this one
um<00:01:52.020> let<00:01:53.020> me<00:01:53.050> just<00:01:53.200> show<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:53.680> guys<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:54.400> has<00:01:54.550> the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
um let me just show you guys it has the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.580 
um let me just show you guys it has the
sticker<00:01:54.970> still<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.630> inside<00:01:55.960> but<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.440> get

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
sticker still on the inside but you get

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.399 
sticker still on the inside but you get
this<00:01:56.740> little<00:01:57.180> sponge<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.420> one<00:01:58.600> side<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.290> then

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
this little sponge on one side and then

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.730 
this little sponge on one side and then
the<00:01:59.440> powder<00:01:59.770> on<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.190> other<00:02:01.260> basically<00:02:02.260> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the powder on the other basically you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.880 
the powder on the other basically you
can<00:02:02.950> choose<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:04.840> shades<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.650> there's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
can choose different shades so there's

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.669 
can choose different shades so there's
fair<00:02:06.580> call<00:02:06.909> fair<00:02:07.240> neutral<00:02:07.720> light<00:02:08.049> warm<00:02:08.379> light

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
fair call fair neutral light warm light

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.030 
fair call fair neutral light warm light
neutral<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.429> then<00:02:09.909> it<00:02:10.000> goes<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.420> way<00:02:10.509> to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
neutral and then it goes all the way to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.039 
neutral and then it goes all the way to
dark<00:02:12.040> neutral<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.760> deep<00:02:12.970> neutral<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.810> there's

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
dark neutral and deep neutral so there's

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.440 
dark neutral and deep neutral so there's
a<00:02:14.200> really<00:02:14.650> good<00:02:14.799> array<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.400> different<00:02:15.760> tones<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
a really good array of different tones I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.170 
a really good array of different tones I
actually<00:02:17.290> found

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
actually found

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
actually found
they<00:02:18.689> were<00:02:18.859> the<00:02:19.859> toads<00:02:20.069> were<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.670> warmer

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
they were the toads were a little warmer

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
they were the toads were a little warmer
than<00:02:21.510> most<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> other<00:02:22.799> urban<00:02:23.040> decay

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
than most of the other urban decay

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.099 
than most of the other urban decay
foundations<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.879> I've<00:02:24.060> used<00:02:24.299> before<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
foundations that I've used before so I

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.140 
foundations that I've used before so I
ended<00:02:25.379> up<00:02:25.439> getting<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.890> fair<00:02:26.370> neutral

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
ended up getting the fair neutral

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.000 
ended up getting the fair neutral
whereas<00:02:28.049> usually<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.950> would<00:02:29.640> get<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.980> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
whereas usually I would get like a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.190 
whereas usually I would get like a
warmer<00:02:32.849> lighter<00:02:33.030> color<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> furniture

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
warmer lighter color but the furniture

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.470 
warmer lighter color but the furniture
works<00:02:34.769> really<00:02:35.069> well<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.519> my<00:02:35.639> skin<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.180> would

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
works really well on my skin I would

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.809 
works really well on my skin I would
recommend<00:02:37.319> probe'<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.609> you<00:02:38.700> can

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
recommend probe' if you can if you can

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.970 
recommend probe' if you can if you can
get<00:02:38.939> yourself<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.359> Sephora<00:02:39.719> store<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.290> test

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
get yourself to a Sephora store and test

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.319 
get yourself to a Sephora store and test
this<00:02:41.069> on<00:02:41.159> your<00:02:41.310> skin<00:02:41.489> before<00:02:41.609> you<00:02:41.819> buy<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
this on your skin before you buy it

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.379 
this on your skin before you buy it
just<00:02:43.109> so<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> don't<00:02:43.469> end<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.889> more

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
just so you don't end up with a more

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.679 
just so you don't end up with a more
orangey<00:02:45.389> tone<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.129> really<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.689> the

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
orangey tone then you really want the

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.780 
orangey tone then you really want the
urban<00:02:49.290> decay<00:02:49.409> or<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.129> definition<00:02:50.579> powder

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
urban decay or to definition powder

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.119 
urban decay or to definition powder
comes<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.419> 14<00:02:51.840> different<00:02:52.109> shades<00:02:52.620> which<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.099> a

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
comes in 14 different shades which is a

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.300 
comes in 14 different shades which is a
really<00:02:53.400> good<00:02:53.669> array<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.629> it's<00:02:55.049> $36<00:02:56.010> which<00:02:56.189> i

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
really good array and it's $36 which i

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.589 
really good array and it's $36 which i
think<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.549> pretty<00:02:56.700> competitively<00:02:57.419> priced

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
think is pretty competitively priced

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.610 
think is pretty competitively priced
compared<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.139> a<00:02:58.169> lot<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.470> other

compared to a lot of the other

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.800 
compared to a lot of the other

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579

think okay and now I have wet the sponge
that<00:04:15.519> comes<00:04:15.669> with<00:04:16.060> this<00:04:16.620> got<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.709> really<00:04:17.919> nice

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
that comes with this got it really nice

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.390 
that comes with this got it really nice
and<00:04:18.280> wet<00:04:18.400> I'm<00:04:18.579> just<00:04:18.789> going<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> try<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:20.400> with

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
and wet I'm just going to try it with

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.240 
and wet I'm just going to try it with
the<00:04:21.489> foundation<00:04:21.880> damp

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.970 

when<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.090> damp<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:31.110> definitely<00:04:31.560> goes<00:04:31.710> on

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
when you do damp it definitely goes on

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.590 
when you do damp it definitely goes on
way<00:04:32.460> heavier<00:04:33.470> so<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.500> think<00:04:34.710> if<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.040> have<00:04:35.600> more

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
way heavier so I think if you have more

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.230 
way heavier so I think if you have more
of<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.840> problem<00:04:37.290> skin<00:04:37.830> or<00:04:38.190> problems<00:04:39.000> with<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
of a problem skin or problems with the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.210 
of a problem skin or problems with the
terms<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.720> your<00:04:39.840> skin<00:04:40.170> it<00:04:40.920> would<00:04:41.040> definitely

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
terms of your skin it would definitely

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.910 
terms of your skin it would definitely
even<00:04:41.940> out<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.570> gives<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.900> really<00:04:43.260> nice<00:04:43.410> smooth

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
even out it gives a really nice smooth

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.060 
even out it gives a really nice smooth
finish<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:47.600> uh<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.410> redness<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.010> I
