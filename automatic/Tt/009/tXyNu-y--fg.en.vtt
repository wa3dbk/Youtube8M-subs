00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.969
 hello everyone and welcome today 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.309
 I bring a Christmas sphere made in this 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.590
 case with cereal box but as 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.230
 you can see here I show you more examples 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.840
 with other materials in this case is 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 made with tetra brik and in this case it is 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.220
 a plastic bottle made with them 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.340
 I invite you to stay and watch this video 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.380
 with me they share it and follow me in my 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.300
 social networks let's start what 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.810
 first thing we're going to do is cut 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.240
 three strips 23 centimeters long 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.310
 by 4 centimeters wide 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.940
 and once we have the three strips 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.190
 let's divide four 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.570
 centimeters 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 then at 5 centimeters and a half we go back to 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.710
 make 4 centimeters 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 to 5 centimeters and a half and finally to 4 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 centimeters 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 this we will do in the three strips when 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 we have already made the divisions that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 I have commented also let's make some 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 cuts on the strip on the right side what 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 we will make a cut in the upper part 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 two centimeters right in the center and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.040
 here on the left side we will do it in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 the bottom likewise a cut of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.130
 two centimeters in the center of this 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.680
 stretch we simply make the cut 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.900
 in this way and we already have in fact the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 cuts 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.010
 Now we are going to trace, I'm going to do it 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.590
 with a pencil for you to see 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.780
 but we do not need to do it with 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.390
 pencil simply with the tip of the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.409
 scissors or something that you can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.950
 mark ok let's take something round 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.220
 and let's make it match the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.460
 corners 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.560
 of the part that has five centimeters 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.520
 and half 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 we match the corners and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.030
 we draw a line 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 rounded that is how we have the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 sample 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.960
 we leave the 4-centimeter stretch without 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.450
 do nothing and we go back to the 5 stretch 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.240
 centimeters and a half there and we go back to 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.510
 match the corners and 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.090
 we draw another circular line 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.370
 we turn the strip and repeat the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.430
 process this is all we have to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.380
 do with the strips we will do it in the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.209
 three strips now what we do will be 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.570
 mark all the doubles so that we are 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.810
 make it easier to fold the strip and also 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.180
 let's mark the circular lines that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.850
 we have so we carefully bend 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.550
 inward and now we're going to close two 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.980
 of the three strips and we do it doing 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.420
 coincide the cuts we had of 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.420
 this way we cross them 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 and we have closed a strip because what 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 same we will do with the other 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.599
 once we have the two strips 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.840
 armed we are going to put one inside the 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.940
 another one of the following form is to the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120
 I'm going to rotate it in this way and 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.690
 the one on the right the turn in this way and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.690
 now fit the one inside the other 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.480
 although it is a bit strange and you see that 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.510
 They fit well but that's how it binds well 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.780
 that 's how we're left and now we're going to 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.020
 take the third strip and we already have all 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.489
 the folds marked and we're going to 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.310
 introduce this part that is more 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.610
 open 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.569
 we put it here and the other end the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.569
 we put in here 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.220
 now we close this strip 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.220
 as we did with the previous ones 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.090
 well this strip can not be left 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.790
 this form first because you see the union 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.710
 and then because it's not forming the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.290
 sphere like we want so 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:24.300
 we have to turn the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.300
 for that we are going to press a little 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.659
 and we have to go around 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.740
 we pull a site very slowly to 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.740
 that is not going to break us 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.540
 we are pulling and going around 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:52.360
 and now we have the union hidden 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.220
 and we can finish forming our 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.920
 sphere to finish forming the 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.490
 we just have to double the 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.830
 circular or semi-circular lines that 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.600
 we had done it is important that those who 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.490
 we have done them previously so that 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.490
 this step is easier 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.909
 we doubled all the places where they are 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.919
 these lines to be forming our 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.800
 sphere as you can see it is already catching 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.990
 way if you see that you do not give them the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.639
 space just pull a little towards 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.809
 up and we have the space 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.749
 enough to do the fold and here 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.509
 we have it ready now simply 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:46.419
 We have to put a string I'll go 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.870
 to put this cord cited gilt holland 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.930
 and cut a piece of about 15 centimeters 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.300
 he more or less folded it in half and I put 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.460
 on a needle that will be easier to put 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.839
 once folded in half I'm going to make you 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:04.460
 a knot in the tip and now I introduce 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:08.070
 in one of the corners 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.040
 I make her leave this way 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.460
 well and here we have finished our 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.340
 sphere in this case made of cardboard or 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.440
 cereal box but here we can see 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.070
 how can it be done with other material 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.620
 like this traffic and it is exactly followed 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.720
 the same process 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.260
 I'm going to show you another one that I've 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.540
 made with a colored plastic bottle 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.450
 green that seems to me this is the one 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.030
 I like the most , it's my favorite the only 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.160
 difference that I have made in this case has 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.120
 been at the time of joining the beginning 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.130
 and the end of the strip I have stuck with 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.830
 zeal to be able to put together since the plastic 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.870
 is easily released is the only 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.840
 difference in this case we had not 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.050
 stuck but in this case if it sticks by 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.110
 help us put it together and as you can see there is a 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.500
 nice job so I'll leave this 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.640
 idea and I hope you liked it 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.770
 I hope you do too and 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.280
 see you in the next tutorial up 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.280
 the next 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.900
 or not
