00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
while the boots are heating up we're

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.470 
while the boots are heating up we're
going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.900> apply<00:01:18.170> pads<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.760> foot<00:01:20.030> work

going to apply pads to the foot work

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.150 
going to apply pads to the foot work
typically<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.260> would<00:01:21.380> normally<00:01:21.770> experience

typically you would normally experience
hot<00:01:22.550> spots<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:23.720> case<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.800> width<00:01:24.980> of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
hot spots in this case it's the width of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.800 
hot spots in this case it's the width of
my<00:01:25.280> foot<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:33.040> put<00:01:34.040> socks<00:01:34.310> on<00:01:34.610> over<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.210> pads<00:01:35.480> and

the liner the boots are done being
heated<00:01:40.430> up<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.120> we're<00:01:41.270> going<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.420> start

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
heated up so now we're going to start

00:01:41.690 --> 00:02:04.480 
heated up so now we're going to start
the<00:01:41.840> vacuum<00:01:42.020> process

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.850 

with<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> boots<00:02:05.479> loosely<00:02:06.020> buckled<00:02:06.409> we're<00:02:06.710> not

with the boots loosely buckled we're not

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.410 
with the boots loosely buckled we're not
going<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.100> put<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.490> cooling<00:02:07.729> pad<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:08.390> that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
going to put on the cooling pad so that

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300 
going to put on the cooling pad so that
the<00:02:08.660> boots<00:02:08.869> cool<00:02:09.229> down<00:02:09.470> as<00:02:09.740> they're<00:02:10.160> being

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the boots cool down as they're being

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:55.089 
the boots cool down as they're being
vacuumed<00:02:29.530> next<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.680> are<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.190> vacuum<00:02:31.580> bags

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.009

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
now I'm gonna get on the machine and

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:57.910 
now I'm gonna get on the machine and
we're<00:02:57.200> going<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.349> attach<00:02:57.439> the<00:02:57.829> air

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
we're going to attach the air

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:24.490 
we're going to attach the air
compressors

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.160 

now<00:03:25.070> with<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.430> bags<00:03:25.640> fully<00:03:26.060> inflated<00:03:26.690> through

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
now with the bags fully inflated through

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.630 
now with the bags fully inflated through
this<00:03:27.380> part<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.830> process<00:03:28.010> takes<00:03:28.490> about

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
this part of the process takes about

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.750 
this part of the process takes about
seven<00:03:29.180> minutes<00:03:29.480> at<00:03:30.050> this<00:03:30.290> point<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.550> pressure

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
seven minutes at this point the pressure

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.360 
seven minutes at this point the pressure
is<00:03:32.030> coming<00:03:32.270> out<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> air<00:03:33.050> bags<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.950> vacuum

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
is coming out of the air bags the vacuum

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.520 
is coming out of the air bags the vacuum
process<00:03:34.550> is<00:03:35.000> finished<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.570> it's<00:03:36.110> time<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.290> see
