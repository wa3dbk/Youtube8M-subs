 use high resolution 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.000
 matrices it is really essential 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.589
 update compared to nikon d7000 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.930
 the body of the apparatus is rather heavy but 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.000
 balanced workmanship on 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.909

 The scheme is located numerous

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.490
 displays the main parameters 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.460
 there you can quickly change 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.799

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.100
 nikon d7100 records footage 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 on two memory cards of the standard sd slot 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.690
 for being closed by a general cap on the right 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
 camera faces can use 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.700
 second backup slot 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.530
 split sizzle and raw files or just 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.890
 switch to the second card when 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 filling 1 on the left side of the case 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.850
 many nests closed with plugs 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.250
 the camera can connect an external microphone 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.240
 and headphones for level control and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.230
 sound quality 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.920
 wired remote 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.550
 gps receiver controls have exits and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 Theme and usb-battery is hiding in the mine 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.720
 metal on the bottom 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.420
 the tripod socket is on the line 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.420
 the optical axis of the lens and enough 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.620
 far from the battery compartment 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.090
 plug closing the connector for 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.470
 additional battery pack 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.800
 keeps tight 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.130
 but it is not attached to the body however 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.350
 the main innovation is nikon d7100 hidden in 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.940
 depths of the hull 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.570
 autofocus system gets 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.850
 information from 50 single sensor 15 out 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.850
 which cruciform for processing 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.280
 algorithm is used and from d4 what 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.320
 increases accuracy especially when bad 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.520
 illuminated 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.190
 expeed 3 processor allowed not only 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.709
 improve color reproduction and reduce noise and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.810
 but also keep at 6 frames per 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.070
 second burst speed at 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.980
 full resolution in d7100 installed 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.220
 new 24 megapixel matrix without 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.330
 optical developmental filter 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.730
 theoretically this could lead to 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.310
 appearance of moire on regular textures 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.980
 but in practice such situations arise 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.350
 infrequently and moire is easy to remove rights 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.230
 converter of the merits of such a design 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.070
 can only be felt when using 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.300
 really upscale 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.910
 high-aperture optics 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.459
 and with whale lenses that are prone 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.750
 atone for the image the difference will be 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.989
 almost imperceptible 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.030
 and iso 6400 even when shooting in jeep 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.730
 provides acceptable results 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.549
 if you consider that 24 megapixels will be 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.830
 reduced when printing two to three times a 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.520
 raw editing capabilities are better 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.860
 but the number 25600 still looks like an advertisement 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.280
 the unit records full hd video from 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.199
 up to 60 frames per second big 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.360
 matrix allows you to use only 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.689
 central area for additional 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.889
 increase the focal length 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.759
 Crop factor becomes 2 without 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.319
 interpolation 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.189
 what expands the creative possibilities 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:49.500
 shooting remote objects if you already 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.569
 grown out of budget cameras or just 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.139
 want to update the machine necessarily 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.639
 try nikon d7100 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.949
 This is a significant step compared to 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.780
 previous versions and decent 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.650
 tool to implement the most 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.069
 ambitious 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.659
 creative ideas with you hotline video 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.620
 were Yuri Sidorenko 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:13.490
 and new and retired flagship nikon d7100 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.490
 I wish you success
