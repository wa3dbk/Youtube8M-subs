00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.959 

right<00:00:08.400> let's<00:00:08.940> look<00:00:09.150> at<00:00:09.500> some<00:00:10.500> finer<00:00:11.309> points<00:00:11.790> on

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
right let's look at some finer points on

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.730 
right let's look at some finer points on
building<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.870> domes<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:16.110> exploded

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
building the domes this is the exploded

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.470 
building the domes this is the exploded
view<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> GD<00:00:17.820> 27<00:00:18.420> you'll<00:00:18.660> notice<00:00:19.110> that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
view for the GD 27 you'll notice that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:31.909 
view for the GD 27 you'll notice that
here<00:00:23.330> here<00:00:28.970> here<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:31.410> few<00:00:31.619> other<00:00:31.800> places

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
here here here and a few other places

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.600 
here here here and a few other places
that<00:00:32.910> there's<00:00:33.410> half<00:00:34.410> triangles<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:37.489> what<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that there's half triangles and what it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.920 
that there's half triangles and what it
is<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.930> panel<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.600> exactly<00:00:42.600> like

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is is this panel here is exactly like

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
is is this panel here is exactly like
this<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.740> I'm<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> lose<00:00:44.310> meaning<00:00:44.490> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this or I'm going to lose meaning the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
this or I'm going to lose meaning the
beauty<00:00:44.970> you<00:00:45.060> know<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:47.390> divided<00:00:48.390> across<00:00:48.990> there

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
beauty you know but divided across there

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.480 
beauty you know but divided across there
oops

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
oops

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.670 
oops
no<00:00:51.560> so<00:00:52.560> that's<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:55.140> panel<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
no so that's that there is that panel a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.970 
no so that's that there is that panel a
so<00:00:56.580> it's<00:00:56.700> basically<00:00:57.120> exactly<00:00:57.780> half<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:59.120> a<00:01:00.120> full

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
so it's basically exactly half of a full

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.510 
so it's basically exactly half of a full
pending<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> pattern

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pending in pattern

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
pending in pattern
these<00:01:03.150> are<00:01:03.570> hexagons<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
these are hexagons and that again is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820 
these are hexagons and that again is
half<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.000> only<00:01:06.210> difference<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> its<00:01:07.290> haft

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
half the only difference is its haft

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.660 
half the only difference is its haft
across<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:13.280> I'll<00:01:14.280> quickly

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
across here like that so I'll quickly

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.020 
across here like that so I'll quickly
demonstrate<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.630> quick<00:01:16.409> way<00:01:16.679> to<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.460> these

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
demonstrate a quick way to make these

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.109 
demonstrate a quick way to make these
from<00:01:18.780> standard<00:01:20.659> frames<00:01:23.149> this<00:01:24.149> one<00:01:24.359> C<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:26.119> half

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
from standard frames this one C is half

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.989 
from standard frames this one C is half

pent triangle for off to mirror
sounds<00:01:30.840> pretty<00:01:31.259> complicated<00:01:31.789> I'm<00:01:32.789> gonna<00:01:32.999> show

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sounds pretty complicated I'm gonna show

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
sounds pretty complicated I'm gonna show
you<00:01:33.450> how<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.530> simple<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.069> is<00:01:36.499> so<00:01:37.499> we

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you how really how simple that is so we

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.809 
you how really how simple that is so we
want<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.630> two<00:01:39.630> halfpence<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.639> has

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
want to make two halfpence and one has

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.819 
want to make two halfpence and one has
to<00:01:41.969> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.240> mirror<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> other<00:01:42.929> sounds

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to be a mirror of the other sounds

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.510 
to be a mirror of the other sounds
complicated

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
complicated

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
complicated
here's<00:01:45.030> how<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.299> doing<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:46.319> we've<00:01:46.649> got

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
here's how it's doing that's we've got

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.580 
here's how it's doing that's we've got
it<00:01:46.859> this<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.249> a<00:01:47.280> pent<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.020> GD<00:01:49.020> twenty<00:01:49.289> seven

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it this is a pent for a GD twenty seven

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.459 
it this is a pent for a GD twenty seven
and<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.179> make<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:51.630> halfpence<00:01:52.200> for

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
and we need to make some halfpence for

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.760 
and we need to make some halfpence for
it

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
it
lots<00:01:53.069> of<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.310> plans<00:01:53.579> need<00:01:53.880> these<00:01:54.119> half<00:01:54.420> pens

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
lots of the plans need these half pens

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
lots of the plans need these half pens
so<00:01:55.469> I'll<00:01:55.590> show<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.889> how<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> make<00:01:56.429> them<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so I'll show you how to make them and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
so I'll show you how to make them and
it's<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.179> quite<00:01:57.359> easy<00:01:57.389> we<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> spit<00:01:58.590> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it's really quite easy we have a spit of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
it's really quite easy we have a spit of
there<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.249> badou<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.929> half<00:02:01.289> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
there to badou here it's about half this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
there to badou here it's about half this
because<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.009> actually<00:02:02.310> doesn't<00:02:02.700> matter<00:02:02.880> how

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because this actually doesn't matter how

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
because this actually doesn't matter how
thick<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.539> because<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> works<00:02:04.079> whatever

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
thick this is because it works whatever

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.919 
thick this is because it works whatever
size<00:02:04.709> timber<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.249> use<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.569> do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
size timber you use what you do is you

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.080 
size timber you use what you do is you
could<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.889> on<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.220> end<00:02:08.459> flat<00:02:08.940> on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
could it with a point on one end flat on

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.800 
could it with a point on one end flat on
the<00:02:09.209> other<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.490> insert<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.810> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the other and you just insert it and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.729 
the other and you just insert it and
they<00:02:13.459> line<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.610> up<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.910> little<00:02:15.330> mark<00:02:18.650> sorts<00:02:19.650> in

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
they line it up a little mark sorts in

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.750 
they line it up a little mark sorts in
the<00:02:19.830> middle

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the middle

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.170 
the middle
would<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.360> that's<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> stood<00:02:23.849> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
would you that's then got a stood it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
would you that's then got a stood it
down<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.510> middle<00:02:24.659> of<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.900> triangle<00:02:25.409> I'm<00:02:25.799> going

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
down the middle of a triangle I'm going

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.699 
down the middle of a triangle I'm going
to<00:02:26.370> screw<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.170> I'll<00:02:28.170> show<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
to screw that in I'll show you on this

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.589 
to screw that in I'll show you on this
one<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:30.569> screw<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> end<00:02:32.849> and

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
one you screw that in to the end and

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.930 
one you screw that in to the end and
screws<00:02:33.900> keep<00:02:34.170> away<00:02:34.440> from<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.799> center<00:02:35.250> because

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
screws keep away from the center because

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.100 
screws keep away from the center because
you<00:02:36.150> can't<00:02:36.330> work<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.659> what<00:02:36.780> we're<00:02:36.870> gonna<00:02:36.959> do

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you can't work on it what we're gonna do

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.259 
you can't work on it what we're gonna do
next<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.220> put<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.549> saw<00:02:38.730> bench<00:02:38.940> and

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
next is we just put on a saw bench and
