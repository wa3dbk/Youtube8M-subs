the<00:01:56.869> season<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.439> think<00:01:57.799> both<00:01:58.009> teams<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:59.360> could

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
the season I think both teams I I could

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.120 
the season I think both teams I I could
almost<00:01:59.810> guarantee<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.320> coaches<00:02:00.740> were<00:02:00.860> saying

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
almost guarantee the coaches were saying

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.990 
almost guarantee the coaches were saying
because<00:02:01.220> they<00:02:01.340> don't<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.790> have<00:02:01.880> any

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
because they don't have really have any

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270 
because they don't have really have any
backups<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.509> don't<00:02:03.439> get<00:02:03.590> hurt<00:02:03.650> we<00:02:04.040> can't

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
before Steve Smith who got a lot of

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.960 
before Steve Smith who got a lot of
attention<00:04:26.950> but<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.340> got<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.490> keep<00:04:27.670> an<00:04:27.820> eye<00:04:27.940> on

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
attention but you got to keep an eye on

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.580 
attention but you got to keep an eye on
the<00:04:28.210> tight<00:04:28.390> end<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.780> think<00:04:28.990> San<00:04:29.170> Francisco

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
the tight end and I think San Francisco

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.990 
the tight end and I think San Francisco
will<00:04:29.740> do<00:04:29.890> that<00:04:30.100> they'll<00:04:30.430> keep<00:04:30.640> him<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:30.970> check

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
will do that they'll keep him in check

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.610 
will do that they'll keep him in check
think<00:04:31.600> it'll<00:04:31.750> be<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.870> tight<00:04:32.080> game<00:04:32.290> for<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.560> while

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
think it'll be a tight game for a while

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.590 
think it'll be a tight game for a while
maybe<00:04:33.250> till<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.580> third<00:04:33.760> quarter<00:04:34.060> see<00:04:34.480> the

Niners pulling away winning by double
digits<00:04:36.100> somewhere<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.030> neighborhood<00:04:37.360> 13

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
digits somewhere in the neighborhood 13

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.870 
digits somewhere in the neighborhood 13
to<00:04:37.840> 14<00:04:38.200> points<00:04:38.590> like<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.130> Niners<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.670> one

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
to 14 points like the Niners in this one

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.960 
to 14 points like the Niners in this one
somewhere<00:04:40.660> around<00:04:40.750> 31<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.740> 17<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.460> think<00:04:42.790> it'll

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
somewhere around 31 to 17 I think it'll

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.280 
somewhere around 31 to 17 I think it'll
be<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.090> high<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.390> scoring<00:04:43.690> game<00:04:43.810> like<00:04:43.990> brian<00:04:44.230> was

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
be a high of scoring game like brian was

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.990 
be a high of scoring game like brian was
talking<00:04:44.680> about<00:04:44.890> so<00:04:45.010> i<00:04:45.070> think<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.340> Niners<00:04:45.640> will

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
talking about so i think the Niners will

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.730 
talking about so i think the Niners will
be<00:04:46.120> able<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.360> exploit<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.750> carolina<00:04:47.320> defense

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
be able to exploit that carolina defense

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.350 
be able to exploit that carolina defense
a<00:04:47.860> little<00:04:48.100> bit<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:48.460> should<00:04:48.910> be<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> great<00:04:49.240> game

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
a little bit so should be a great game

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.810 
a little bit so should be a great game
