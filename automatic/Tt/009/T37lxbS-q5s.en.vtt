00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.330
 this is the sad story of machinations 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.549
 Perez company that once boasted its 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.510
 greatness and success and that today there are not even 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.520
 its shadows 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.559
 this story goes back to 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.540
 just a few months when they closed the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 contract with the new supplier of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.820
 industrial dining rooms from the first 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.220
 day the promise was not fulfilled the meal 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 It was cold the service was bad so 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.780
 Time passed and things did not improve 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 but they started to be scandalous 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.640
 the menus never matched and all the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.400
 days the same food was served 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 a strange appearance the terrible taste 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.230
 the rations were for hunger and hygiene 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 never met in that dining room and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.280
 it was even rumored that the chef in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.050
 reality was automotive mechanic those 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629

 in their jobs morale

 went to the ground and people started to flee
