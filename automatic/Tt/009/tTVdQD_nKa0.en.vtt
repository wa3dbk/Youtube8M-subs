in front of me or you can go around this
corner<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.680> corner<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
corner right here which this corner is a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
corner right here which this corner is a
little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.549> dangerous<00:01:14.990> since<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> hit

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
little bit dangerous since the hit

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
little bit dangerous since the hit
detection<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> great<00:01:17.130> there's<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
detection is not that great there's a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280 
detection is not that great there's a
good<00:01:18.180> chance<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> dying<00:01:18.659> while<00:01:19.080> running

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
good chance of you dying while running

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
good chance of you dying while running
away<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.619> around<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> corner<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.030> try<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
away like around the corner so I try to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
away like around the corner so I try to
stay<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.720> throw<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:22.049> motion<00:01:22.380> sensor

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
stay right here throw my motion sensor

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
stay right here throw my motion sensor
into<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> pile<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.570> can't

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
into the into the pile so they can't

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
into the into the pile so they can't
destroy<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.140> that's<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:26.040> tip<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
destroy it that's another tip if you if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
destroy it that's another tip if you if
you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you can see like if you if you have a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
you can see like if you if you have a
spot<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.070> throw<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.579> motion

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
spot where you can throw your motion

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
spot where you can throw your motion
sensor<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.630> something<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.110> onto<00:01:31.409> something

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
sensor into something or onto something

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
sensor into something or onto something
where<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:31.890> can't<00:01:32.100> reach<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.460> always<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
where they can't reach it always do that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
where they can't reach it always do that
so<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.960> can't<00:01:34.200> destroy<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.400> right

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so then I can't destroy it and right

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
so then I can't destroy it and right
here<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.420> survived<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:36.960> I
