 eleven clicking on this button will open 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.560
 another page where they will have to wait 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.049
 5 seconds 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.180
 they give in jump advertising and their 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.180
 update will begin to download 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 already after having completed the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.979
 download we will open the horizon to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.570

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.570
 configured from xbox 360 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.880
 after horizon recognizes our 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.090
 usb connected to the computer what 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.369
 we will do is give wit file we will look 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.979
 the update that in my case is in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.649
 downloads we select it and we give it to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.590
 open we wait for the bar to load 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.209
 green and we give ok in the notice that appears 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.160
 and that will be all 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.230
 the update will be in the folder 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.480
 useful of Ãºbeda test 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.440
 finally we have to expel our 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.629
 usb and connect it to our xbox 360 at 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.909
 enter minecraft or in the game to 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.159
 which we downloaded the update we 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.480
 will appear that has been updated 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.730
 remember that there are games in which 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.180
 it does not appear simply because there will be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.890
 updated if you disconnect the usb venues 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.080
 update your game so the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.110
 update you can move it from the usb 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.860
 to the hard drive of your xbox 360 so that it does not 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.860
 happen that
