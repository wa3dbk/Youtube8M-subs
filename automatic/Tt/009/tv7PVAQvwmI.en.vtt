ten I hate to say it but at the end of
the<00:00:14.039> day<00:00:14.250> my<00:00:14.639> gut<00:00:15.059> tells<00:00:15.510> me<00:00:15.780> he's<00:00:16.560> gonna<00:00:16.770> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the day my gut tells me he's gonna be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.529 
the day my gut tells me he's gonna be
happy<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.550> millions<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.060> millions<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.550 

that<00:00:34.240> but<00:00:34.600> I<00:00:34.630> think<00:00:34.750> there's<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.200> couple<00:00:35.350> of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
that but I think there's a couple of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.110 
that but I think there's a couple of
things<00:00:35.710> first<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.160> all<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.340> studying<00:00:36.700> this<00:00:36.910> guy

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
things first of all in studying this guy

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.050 
things first of all in studying this guy
in<00:00:37.300> four<00:00:37.570> games<00:00:37.840> I'm<00:00:38.830> not<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.130> Cam<00:00:39.430> Newton<00:00:39.820> fan

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
in four games I'm not a Cam Newton fan

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.420 
in four games I'm not a Cam Newton fan
if<00:00:40.960> you<00:00:41.020> like<00:00:41.320> Vince<00:00:41.590> Young<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:42.010> like<00:00:42.190> Tim

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
if you like Vince Young you like Tim

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.310 
if you like Vince Young you like Tim
Tebow<00:00:42.460> those<00:00:43.060> are<00:00:43.210> first<00:00:43.360> rounders<00:00:43.870> then

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
Tebow those are first rounders then

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.750 
Tebow those are first rounders then
you're<00:00:44.440> gonna<00:00:44.560> like<00:00:44.800> Cam<00:00:45.100> Newton<00:00:45.460> I<00:00:45.580> would

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
you're gonna like Cam Newton I would

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.070 
you're gonna like Cam Newton I would
have<00:00:45.880> taken<00:00:46.000> either<00:00:46.270> one<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.510> those<00:00:46.630> guys<00:00:46.690> in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
have taken either one of those guys in

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.900 
have taken either one of those guys in
the<00:00:47.170> first<00:00:47.320> round<00:00:47.680> I<00:00:47.860> wouldn't<00:00:48.370> take<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:48.700> guy

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
the first round I wouldn't take this guy

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.040 
the first round I wouldn't take this guy
in<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.180> first<00:00:49.390> round<00:00:49.660> I<00:00:49.750> think<00:00:49.840> he's<00:00:50.020> a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
in the first round I think he's a

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.080 
in the first round I think he's a
project<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.830> think<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.190> vision<00:00:51.430> issues<00:00:51.879> are

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
project I think the vision issues are

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.210 
project I think the vision issues are
there<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.750> instinct<00:00:53.290> issues<00:00:53.620> are<00:00:53.830> there<00:00:54.040> I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
there the instinct issues are there I

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.860 
there the instinct issues are there I
don't<00:00:54.400> care<00:00:54.640> if<00:00:54.910> it's<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.120> spread<00:00:55.480> offense

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
don't care if it's the spread offense

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.630 
don't care if it's the spread offense
there's<00:00:56.440> no<00:00:56.590> comparison<00:00:57.250> between

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
there's no comparison between

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.670 
there's no comparison between
gabart<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.450> him<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:58.809> they're<00:00:59.200> both<00:00:59.410> in<00:00:59.590> a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
gabart and him and they're both in a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
gabart and him and they're both in a
spread<00:00:59.950> offense<00:01:00.129> as<00:01:00.520> far<00:01:00.760> enabled

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 

yeah<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> break<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
yeah I think really when you break it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
yeah I think really when you break it
down<00:01:14.550> 292<00:01:15.270> throws<00:01:15.510> all<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.020> his

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
down 292 throws all I have is his

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.750 
down 292 throws all I have is his
collegiate<00:01:16.350> career<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.370> were<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
collegiate career and they were really

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.700 
collegiate career and they were really
loose<00:01:18.000> play<00:01:18.300> throws<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.780> Steve<00:01:19.020> said<00:01:19.050> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
loose play throws as Steve said that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
loose play throws as Steve said that
office<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.340> nothing<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.850> anything<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
office is nothing like anything in the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
office is nothing like anything in the
National<00:01:21.780> Football<00:01:21.900> League<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.770> at

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
National Football League it's look at

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.650 
National Football League it's look at
take<00:01:23.160> off<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.910> look<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.480> with

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
take off and these look at the one with

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.300 
take off and these look at the one with
that<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:25.050> body<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.560> he'll<00:01:25.680> work<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.070> well

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that big body and he'll work out well

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.630 
that big body and he'll work out well
but<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.910> think<00:01:27.090> ultimately

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.210 

ham<00:01:31.940> on<00:01:32.180> film<00:01:32.480> my<00:01:32.720> god<00:01:33.560> these<00:01:33.740> are<00:01:33.920> running

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
ham on film my god these are running

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.190 
ham on film my god these are running
back<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.760> he<00:01:34.970> throws<00:01:35.150> once<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.630> while<00:01:35.780> when

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
back and he throws once in a while when

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.780 
back and he throws once in a while when
he<00:01:36.230> throws<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.620> throw<00:01:36.800> different<00:01:37.160> issues

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
he throws you throw different issues

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.000 
he throws you throw different issues
different<00:01:38.030> red<00:01:38.630> flags<00:01:38.960> with<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.470> Jake<00:01:39.770> Locker

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
different red flags with a Jake Locker

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.490 
different red flags with a Jake Locker
which<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.970> accuracy<00:01:41.360> thing<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.290> Cam

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
which is the accuracy thing and a Cam

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.590 
which is the accuracy thing and a Cam
Newton<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.430> guess<00:01:43.880> would<00:01:44.000> be<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.150> focus

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
Newton which I guess would be a focus

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.100 
Newton which I guess would be a focus
issue<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.220> into<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.550> 100%<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.720> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
issue and it is the into it 100% and and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.480 
issue and it is the into it 100% and and
sometimes<00:01:48.410> people<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:49.130> raising<00:01:49.460> their

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
sometimes people are raising their

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.430 
sometimes people are raising their
eyebrows<00:01:49.910> like<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.420> know<00:01:50.510> where<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.200> kid

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
eyebrows like you know where is this kid

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.530 
eyebrows like you know where is this kid
gonna<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.860> when<00:01:52.280> he<00:01:52.340> gets<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.580> paycheck<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.270> so
