00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.960
 to all fans of a leopard 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 Regular greetings from Yekaterinburg 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 defeat in the third match of the eastern 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.670
 the quarter-finals of yesterday's event 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 all remember of course but not clog your head 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.990
 worth and there is no time right 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.140
 today is the fourth standoff 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.940
 Kazan and Yekaterinburg 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.399
 early game start at 16:30 by 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 Tatarstan time implies that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 with arc training core 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 playing the composition would not raid the arena 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.200
 Uralets 6 hours before the start of the match came out 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 only those players who are 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.030
 represent emergency reserve 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.309
 combat unit zentai uniform though 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 is he really like that 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.190
 inviolate defeat team 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.770
 often provokes the rotation of players 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.690
 plan today what will play three 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.369
 meters 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.760
 together there is still decided who 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.200
 rest today 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.120
 small but will be Well Well apparently 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.220
 team coaching staff counts on 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.860
 what Kirill Petrov will look like 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.010
 the fourth game of the series is fresher faster 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.170
 and will be able to lead a partner who 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 will be a partner of Petrov in the top three 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.970
 attack trailer and make decisions 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.470
 just before the boy after 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.760
 workouts use cases we 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.250
 asked again Andrei Falcon 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.690
 still comment on the defeat in 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.970
 third quarter final match with 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.820
 0 2 3 shelves but yesterday we did not 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.130
 played their best game 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.710
 what sensations what conclusions are made 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.650
 it's been almost a day after graduation 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.570
 match 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.020
 if the tools are in the hands of coaching 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.290
 headquarters to rectify the situation i think 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.540
 we have the best shooters we played 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.030
 but by content this game is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.710
 even lost it was better than 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.429
 home so let's say there probably was 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.760
 more on the nerves there they know first 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.560
 games especially moments there were moments there were 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.600
 we need to realize our moments we 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
 make rivals make mistakes but 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.820
 forget back ie we get it 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.670
 you need to beat the goalkeeper they do not hope 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.970
 today, what kind of tools? 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.480
 he will probably change something 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.420
 prompt change as big by 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 realizations of most of us though of course 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.860
 it all depends on the guys on the skill of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.150
 when there are exits from 3 to 1 and doorways 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.459
 water legs and so outs in 10 over hammer 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.620
 in your experience 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.570
 great playoff games for there are such 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.250
 moments when you don't score on 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.440
 you develop and then break through 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.350
 but it is what about 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.450
 matures are brewing then straightened then 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.600
 there are no moments when it is 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.489
 The problem is we have some moments even though 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.760
 swam in the final will not be there 100 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.830
 moments so do not need these here 4 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.459
 moment in 5 moment iron they need 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.080
 to hammer 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.680
 otherwise it will be very difficult to play 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.860
 constantly play there without advantage 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.390
 so let's say well there 1 scored puck 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.220
 difficult they don't want to swim nowhere 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.959
 getting around 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.160
 goalkeeper swim say team half 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.870
 motorist sample spring 2015 this 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.790
 confirms problems in attack 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 Leopard primarily come from the game 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.700
 rival team's goalkeeper necessary 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.739
 replay to respect 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.730
 i say again there now more 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.010
 she's probably more 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.599
 still on fire still aggressively at the gate these 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.220
 here, too, here man needs more 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.440
 more cunning 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.750
 these moments where you can show 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.610
 you gotta hit hit girls can it 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.720
 sets almost not much gradually 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.200
 the setting so at home was scored therefore 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.129
 guys understand everything needs to be done but here 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.069
 say same times so today 4 by 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.480
 order confrontation ak leopard and 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.299
 motorist final she already 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.639
 definitely will not be so we will believe in that 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.190
 that the flagship today and the skates will be 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.820
 cut the ice faster and save the pig 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.550
 more precisely 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.440
 and shoulders withstand all the loads and the puck 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.169
 the puck is not just exchanged with the goalkeeper 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.210
 rival layers continues live 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.210
 hockey cheer quartz 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.279
 but
