seriously
classical<00:03:08.760> music<00:03:08.989> basically<00:03:09.989> what<00:03:10.350> we're

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
classical music basically what we're

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.050 
classical music basically what we're
after<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.950> communicating<00:03:11.640> stuff<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.940> other

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
people and if you don't take yourself

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.760 
people and if you don't take yourself
too<00:03:14.850> seriously<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.480> much<00:03:15.630> easier<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:16.049> do

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.810 

the<00:03:24.770> studio<00:03:25.100> class<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.640> more<00:03:26.330> of<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:27.820> cooking

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
the studio class is more of a cooking

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.560 
the studio class is more of a cooking
spot<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:30.290> think<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.310> look<00:03:31.820> at<00:03:31.940> my<00:03:32.060> studio<00:03:32.300> class

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
spot I think I look at my studio class

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.880 
spot I think I look at my studio class
as<00:03:32.750> being<00:03:32.960> an<00:03:33.050> opportunity<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:33.590> people<00:03:33.800> to

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
as being an opportunity for people to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.950 
as being an opportunity for people to
get<00:03:33.980> up<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.190> get<00:03:34.280> nervous<00:03:34.660> obviously<00:03:35.660> playing

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
get up and get nervous obviously playing

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.290 
get up and get nervous obviously playing
free<00:03:36.140> appears<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.620> hardest<00:03:37.100> thing<00:03:37.280> so<00:03:37.970> if

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
free appears is the hardest thing so if

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.640 
free appears is the hardest thing so if
students<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.750> get<00:03:38.870> comfortable<00:03:39.140> with<00:03:39.410> doing

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
students can get comfortable with doing

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.780 
students can get comfortable with doing
that<00:03:39.770> they're<00:03:40.010> going<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.310> be<00:03:40.550> in<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.700> much

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that they're going to be in a much

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.190 
that they're going to be in a much
better<00:03:40.850> situation<00:03:41.300> for<00:03:41.660> coping<00:03:42.170> with

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
better situation for coping with

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.770 
better situation for coping with
pressure<00:03:42.530> situations<00:03:43.100> that<00:03:43.220> are<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.750> I

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
pressure situations that are on but I

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.960 
pressure situations that are on but I
also<00:03:45.080> look<00:03:45.680> at<00:03:45.830> studio<00:03:46.100> classes<00:03:46.340> being<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.790> way

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
also look at studio classes being a way

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.260 
also look at studio classes being a way
of<00:03:47.150> learning<00:03:47.330> how<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.140> express<00:03:48.530> yourself<00:03:48.740> well

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
of learning how to express yourself well

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.080 
of learning how to express yourself well

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
history people have talked about the

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.360 
history people have talked about the
flute<00:04:34.400> being<00:04:34.700> every<00:04:35.120> emotional<00:04:35.660> sound<00:04:36.590> very

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
flute being every emotional sound very

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.270 
flute being every emotional sound very
close<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.880> what<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.150> voice<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.570> do<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.280> I

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
close to what the voice can do and I

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.340 
close to what the voice can do and I
like<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.820> idea<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.420> flute<00:04:41.660> at<00:04:41.990> this

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
like the idea that the flute at this

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.460 
like the idea that the flute at this
point<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:42.800> time<00:04:43.090> flute<00:04:44.090> can<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:44.480> Celtic<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.380> it

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
point in time flute can be Celtic so it

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.100 
point in time flute can be Celtic so it
can<00:04:45.590> be<00:04:45.710> rock<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.580> be<00:04:46.670> chairs<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:48.020> it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
can be rock so it can be chairs so it

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.620 
can be rock so it can be chairs so it
can<00:04:48.230> be<00:04:48.320> classical<00:04:48.950> it's<00:04:49.670> all<00:04:49.820> very<00:04:50.030> doable<00:04:50.300> on

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
can be classical it's all very doable on

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.740 
can be classical it's all very doable on
the<00:04:50.750> flute

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.410 

so<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.840> can<00:05:00.110> be
