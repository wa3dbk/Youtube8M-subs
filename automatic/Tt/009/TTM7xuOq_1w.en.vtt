00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.139
 bmw active hybrid 3 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 here the heart of the car 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.429
 so the engine is a 3000 tube of 304 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.919
 horses combined with a gearbox group e 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.960
 electric motor placed under the engine 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.699
 more inside where it is usually placed 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.890
 the 54 horsepower electric motor gearbox 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 this pairing done inside the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
 gearbox causes synergy 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.410
 between electric motor and heat engine 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 let's always be perfect we never hear one 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 tear when the two engines do it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.420
 switch is back here of course 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 the battery puts the engine compartment in the compartment 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.290
 sorry baggage is a little less 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.890
 deep because there is this battery ai 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.520
 lithium ions that gives energy to the engine 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.220
 electric 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 together they have a pair of 450 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.830
 newtonmeters and a power of about 340 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.780
 all feel horses now 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.900
 let's see in detail and in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 guides how the hybrid system works 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.160
 bmw for the first mode we try is 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 that eco pro we start with this one 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.230
 mode is obviously if the battery has it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 allows if it loads enough 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.670
 let's start electric the first test that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.030
 we do is on a road we say 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 hilly then we will do it downhill 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.020
 in this case with the pro echo activated 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 we will always go as electric here 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
 display we have activated the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.310
 display of energy flows 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.710
 as you can see the power comes only from the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.049
 electric motor are 54 horses that 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 they are distributed to the wheels and the energy 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.940
 comes from the battery we have two notches 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 of battery but if we want to know with 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.110
 more precision how much energy we have 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.970
 lithium ions in front of ours 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 dashboard we can see that the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.230
 battery and 29 percent 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 in this case we are going down there is one 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:12.150
 descent crush the brake a little bit e 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.460
 in this case the mode is activated in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.670
 recharge therefore not only the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:22.709
 brake pads to brake the car 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 but it is the energy generator that charges 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.040
 the slight uphill battery I accelerated 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 a little more has entered the heat engine 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.620
 we have absolutely not heard the 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.910
 change of driving mode here is of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.920
 the descent again 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.550
 look like this 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.239
 very slight engine brake effect 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.640
 charging is recharging the battery 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.410
 so we will practically go downhill 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.660
 all this electric road here 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.910
 when we are on the falsipiani above all 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
 in eco pro mode and I'll do it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.299
 see among other things when inserting 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.100
 eco pro as the display mimÃ¬ accent 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.100
 this insertion 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.410
 this time he prefers very much the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.230
 electric motor operation 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.810
 in addition to that in the display here in front of the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.150
 my eyes is shown to me beyond 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.910
 battery charge 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 how many more miles I'm doing 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.910
 thanks to the eco pro mode if in 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:39.940
 however I go down to the mode 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:43.000
 standard or even sports then we go 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.040
 delta standard that calls you comfort la 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.440
 management is more or less similar to that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.980
 of the echo pro with a slight prevalence 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.600
 of the heat engine on the electric one 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.300
 but you see they are still downhill 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.190
 then still inertia and I'm still 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.640
 using practically only the engine 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.459
 electric if instead I put in sports beyond 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.020
 to change the structure is also the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.860
 hardness of the steering wheel just heard a 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.800
 stiffening of the steering wheel 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.980
 the engine turns on and will never go in 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.040
 stop always ready to give us that plus of 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.660
 energy given by motor synergy 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.220
 electric motor thermal in all 340 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.280
 horses 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.360
 back in in eco pro then turn off 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.980
 the engine the heat engine echoed throughout 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.790
 this said I left when I had it 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.190
 about 29 percent of battery e 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.720
 now always braking while braking 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.440
 regenerative because I have before 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.260
 eyes an indicator that tells me how much 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.570
 brake when I'm regenerating and when 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.700
 accelerated how much energy I use or 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.010
 when it entered the heat engine if they are 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.560
 good and so little heaven or if they are less 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.320
 good and so I go to the area no longer 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.240
 blue but blue 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.050
 and I told you about the battery charge 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 I got 75 percent in these 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.670
 a few kilometers the generator of 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.190
 neither does it generate a lot of energy 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.830
 I started from 29 percent here 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.690
 this was a situation we say of 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.430
 downhill mountain hill where 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.830
 we have practically never used the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.420
 engine the heat engine 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.370
 let's go now instead to see one 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.780
 situation is here we do a test 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.270
 on a situation that is extra urban 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.790
 we are always in echo pro then the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.970
 mode which prefers the engine 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.100
 electric up to about 40 50 even 60 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.070
 kilometers per hour if we press little 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.620
 the accelerator and we stay in the first 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.190
 display stages 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.050
 we go into electric crushing mode 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.420
 a little more because here we are in slight 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.250
 climb and immediately enter the heat engine 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.930
 compared to other hybrids we have 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.240
 tried maybe the heat engine is 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.470
 predominant compared to the engine 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.230
 electric also in eco pro ma mode 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.780
 I would say that on this bmw maybe the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.270
 synergy of gearbox positioning 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.790
 and enter the box together with the motor 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.920
 electrical causes the passage to be 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.140
 exceptional in any other I have 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.110
 written this this fluidity of 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.889
 switching between electric and 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:33.860
 and thermal qua situation 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.180
 steady pace slightly uphill pro 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.469
 while the power required the engine 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.999
 such that electric could not 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:41.479
 to satisfy it then remains on 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:43.669
 engine over here overpass 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.830
 although we are 75 kilometers per hour 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.659
 accelerator way and enter 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.180
 the electric because we are downhill and 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.939
 we take advantage of gravity 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.509
 we are entering the highway we ask 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.409
 something more we carry ourselves to a vague state 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.159
 lete 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:04.669
 the display gave us a hint of 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:07.009
 just press the accelerator and these 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.909
 they are suggestions to contain 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:15.490
 consumption at motorway speed in eco 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:20.419
 pro even at 130 kilometers per hour 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:24.349
 releasing the accelerator it comes off the 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:26.930
 transmission is in deceleration the 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:29.210
 but the heat engine is just switched off 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.310
 we touch the generator this happens 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.379
 exceeded 60 70 kilometers per hour on 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.509
 heat engine turns on so no 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:38.270
 we can sail in situations 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:41.550
 motorways but only in situations 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.590
 urban or extra urban areas 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:47.310
 all this leads to consumption 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:51.380
 lower average than the version 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:54.480
 not hybrid but this saving is 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.060
 especially in the city where they are able to 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.170
 do see also 10 11 km liter that 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.630
 they are not bad for a 3 thousand turbo in 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:07.530
 situations instead of highway or 

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:11.210
 given the savings are less obvious for 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.210
