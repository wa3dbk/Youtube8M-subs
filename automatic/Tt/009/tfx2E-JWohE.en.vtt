in<00:00:39.820> my<00:00:40.030> opinion<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.690> bachata<00:00:41.380> dances

in my opinion as bachata dances

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.950 
in my opinion as bachata dances
internationalised<00:00:42.820> and<00:00:43.150> been<00:00:43.450> taught<00:00:43.690> around

internationalised and been taught around

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.580 
internationalised and been taught around
the<00:00:44.110> world

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
the world

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.340 
the world
one<00:00:45.220> aspect<00:00:45.400> most<00:00:46.030> neglected<00:00:46.300> when<00:00:46.900> teaching

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
one aspect most neglected when teaching

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.170 
one aspect most neglected when teaching
it<00:00:47.500> is<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.340> fact<00:00:48.580> that<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.820> can<00:00:49.000> dance

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
it is the fact that you can dance

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.200 
it is the fact that you can dance
bachata<00:00:49.450> on<00:00:49.870> all<00:00:49.990> four<00:00:50.260> beats<00:00:50.880> when<00:00:51.880> I<00:00:51.910> mean<00:00:52.180> by

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
bachata on all four beats when I mean by

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.680 
bachata on all four beats when I mean by
this<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.990> that<00:00:53.530> your<00:00:53.710> basic<00:00:54.250> step<00:00:54.670> can<00:00:55.330> start

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
this is that your basic step can start

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.350 
this is that your basic step can start
on<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.080> one<00:00:56.350> two<00:00:56.800> three<00:00:57.430> or<00:00:57.730> four<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.240> the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
music and all are okay that also means

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.829 
music and all are okay that also means
that<00:01:02.320> your<00:01:02.620> tap<00:01:02.920> touch<00:01:03.460> or<00:01:03.700> syncopated<00:01:04.570> step

that your tap touch or syncopated step

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.800 
that your tap touch or syncopated step
can<00:01:05.199> occur<00:01:05.650> on<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.430> one<00:01:06.670> two<00:01:07.030> three<00:01:07.390> or<00:01:07.510> four

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
can occur on the one two three or four

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:22.179 
can occur on the one two three or four
depending<00:01:08.050> on<00:01:08.440> when<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.800> start
