00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thinking that this is actually the best

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.450 
thinking that this is actually the best
and<00:01:50.869> then<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.860> done<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.280> need

and then when you're done you don't need

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
and then when you're done you don't need
it<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.790> click<00:01:54.000> home<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.020> back<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the default message is up so I'm

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.639 
the default message is up so I'm
