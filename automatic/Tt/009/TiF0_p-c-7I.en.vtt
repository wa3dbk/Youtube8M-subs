but<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.700> meant<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.330> low<00:03:33.590> D<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
but this is meant to have a low D on it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.390 
but this is meant to have a low D on it
although<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.269> reentrant

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
although I have it I have it reentrant

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.800 
although I have it I have it reentrant
because<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.489> didn't<00:03:41.730> have<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.510> correct

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
because I didn't have the the correct

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.710 
because I didn't have the the correct
strings<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:46.489> this<00:03:47.489> baritone<00:03:48.299> probably

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
strings for that this baritone probably

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.569 
strings for that this baritone probably
had<00:03:48.930> some<00:03:49.260> steel<00:03:49.709> wound<00:03:49.980> strings<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.549> it

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
had some steel wound strings on it

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.080 
had some steel wound strings on it
because<00:03:50.909> I<00:03:51.000> noticed<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.519> frets<00:03:53.519> which

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
because I noticed that the frets which

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.280 
because I noticed that the frets which
are<00:03:54.239> plastic<00:03:54.860> are<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> little<00:03:56.670> worn<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.260> when<00:03:58.260> I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
are plastic are a little worn and when I

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.789 
are plastic are a little worn and when I
first<00:03:58.709> strung<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.870> instrument<00:04:01.440> when<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.590> got

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
first strung this instrument when I got

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.770 
first strung this instrument when I got
it<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.099> buzzed<00:04:02.430> pretty<00:04:03.180> badly<00:04:03.859> so<00:04:04.859> I<00:04:04.890> put<00:04:05.370> I

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it it buzzed pretty badly so I put I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.690 
it it buzzed pretty badly so I put I
raised<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.989> saddle<00:04:07.379> or<00:04:08.010> right<00:04:08.340> now<00:04:08.459> it's<00:04:08.640> just

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
raised the saddle or right now it's just

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:31.550 
raised the saddle or right now it's just
a<00:04:09.170> bit<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.349> pen<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.780> works<00:04:12.989> fine<00:04:30.560> it

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
a bit of a pen and it works fine it

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.690 
a bit of a pen and it works fine it
sounds<00:04:31.889> great

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.020 

he's<00:04:35.700> got<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.530> swirled<00:04:37.530> back<00:04:38.130> insides<00:04:38.610> like

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
he's got the swirled back insides like

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
he's got the swirled back insides like
they<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.599> soprano<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.639> little<00:04:41.639> added

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
they do on the soprano a little added

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.020 
they do on the soprano a little added
things<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:44.039> this<00:04:44.190> one<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.610> The<00:04:44.729> Sopranos

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
things on this one that The Sopranos

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.960 
things on this one that The Sopranos
don't<00:04:45.389> have<00:04:45.599> I<00:04:45.930> think<00:04:46.440> there's<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.490> little<00:04:47.729> cap

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
don't have I think there's a little cap

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.610 
don't have I think there's a little cap
here<00:04:48.000> which<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.660> think<00:04:48.690> had<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> hole<00:04:49.229> in<00:04:49.260> that's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
here which I think had a hole in that's

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.469 
here which I think had a hole in that's
probably<00:04:49.979> where<00:04:50.190> they<00:04:50.310> injected<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.970> plastic

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
probably where they injected the plastic

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.020 
probably where they injected the plastic
in<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.810> mold<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:53.580> there's<00:04:53.760> this<00:04:53.880> little

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
in the mold and then there's this little

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.560 
in the mold and then there's this little
seal<00:04:54.419> here<00:04:54.900> for<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.919> hole<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.490> on<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.300> seal

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
seal here for the hole and on the seal

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.909 
seal here for the hole and on the seal
is<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.910> maca<00:04:59.910> fairy<00:05:00.470> seal<00:05:03.560> it's<00:05:04.560> got<00:05:04.710> some

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
is the maca fairy seal it's got some
