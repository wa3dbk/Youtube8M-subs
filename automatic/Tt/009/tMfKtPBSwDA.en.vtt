00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone i'm a parakeet min and this is my 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.049
 Video 60 on YouTube today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.000
 of a television show that I 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.099
 I looked when I was little and twice 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 when they came to my city I could see them 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 live it's about 69 % shower that is a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.430
 program in which they stick to stick although to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.439
 sometimes not so much but when I saw them in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 alive the ring rumbled from the blows and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.699
 you're scared you go with the jumps but in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 yes I will not talk about that but about 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.170
 some things that seem very 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.840
 stupid of the program first I'm going to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 talk about referees and judges 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 this is re stupidity because they are just 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 some more spectators I say this because to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 a fighter was hanged from a crane and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.120
 the referees did nothing to make it worse 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 that when they charge something they do it for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.230
 the supposed bad then there is a little old man 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 which is the one that hires the fighters 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 and the referees, he can throw them out and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 do what you want but the referees 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320
 they beat the players and the old man 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.930
 he looks at the fight as if he were 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.210
 a spectator this old man always 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.189
 feel at a table that always break it 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 the fighters because they throw themselves over 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.549
 the very gross 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 it also makes me warm up that they leave 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.630
 fight anybody because there is a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 bunch of fighters who have 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 physical problems that could not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 make them fight this torticollis that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.090
 supposedly can not move the neck 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 the guy but that's a lie because 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 chabón moves us to everywhere in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 the fight there is also one that is called 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.479
 actito morán that is a fat man who has 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.149
 like 69 kilos of overweight is like the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 fan of graciela alfano in the end not what 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 they would have to let fight to see if 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 grab a heart attack in the middle of a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.030
 fight there is also one that burned him the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.240
 face with acid but that is impossible 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.429
 because if he should not have died 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 then there are the fighters are 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.890
 divided into two camps the good ones and the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.289
 bad guys never fight a good one against a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.539
 good and evil the same 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.299
 first they just fight ordinary and 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.390
 they spend their time greeting people they are the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.240
 what more blows they receive later are the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 bad these are all d asshole 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 because they spend fighting the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 little ones and they have a lot of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 behavior problems that would have them 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.680
 that have sanctioned more 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 and nine times, but since they are rejects 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.320
 they do not sanction them, they make you recharge 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.720
 from laughter the wrestlers fight in a 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.550
 stadium but it makes you reload with laughter 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.350
 because below the place that is full of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.690
 chairs and trash cans in which 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 they never use it for their common uses but 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.170
 that are there for the wrestlers 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.050
 grab them and they start to stick with 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.490
 that now I'm going to talk about the history of 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.320
 the fighters supposedly good the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.480
 69% of the fighters were born in countries 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.760
 recontra rare that nobody knew as 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.459
 Lithuania mongolia and rare countries like 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.860
 all those to me used to play at 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.260
 tutti frutti equal I think that if 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
 they live in I do not know where land since they go to 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.890
 know about a fight program in 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.050
 Argentina that is less known than my 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.510
 what in two sure are all 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.970
 Argentines now I'm going to talk about the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.150
 stories themselves almost all are re 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.760
 Most dragons are not credible 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.020
 now I tell you some the first is 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.090
 feline 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.090
 supposedly this chabón was baby and he 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.260
 he fell from an airplane in a jungle 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.490
 supposedly the lions adopted it 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.890
 as his son but 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.020
 is that if you throw a baby into the jungle from 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.930
 an airplane does not survive the fall and it 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.090
 eat the lions we were also what 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.030
 that supposedly was a vampire or something 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.220
 so that left me speechless too 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.380
 is the dog man this supposedly 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.270
 he's crazy or something like that but if he were 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.150
 crazy really it would not have to be 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.060
 professional wrestler now I'm going to talk 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.130
 of music so it's music because 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.170
 It was short and they only said the name 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.720
 of the wrestler a lot of times saying 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.420
 which was the best or things like that I remember 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.970
 of a song that said moloch moloch 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.650
 the vampire the strength of a bad mood is 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.080
 feeds on the blood of animals 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.080
 mammals only light can stop it 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.240
 that bit me was the whole song 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.000
 agreement of that because I had the cde of 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.800
 the songs now I'm going to talk about 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.900
 some fighters themselves that were the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.870
 more important and that made me laugh more 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.970
 but for how stupid they were the first one is 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.220
 max floyd is not a mix of paul 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.280
 mccartney with pink floyd or anything like that 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.170
 weird stuff is a fighter supposedly 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.300
 Scottish who is fighting with the 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.699
 younger and has very behavioral 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.740
 lives but that make you shit with laughter 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.659
 I remember when I went to see the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.610
 live program when he came to my city 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.620
 there was an old man with his son and he asked 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.389
 that he put on a good face like that 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.500
 a picture and he very lining scared him 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.659
 tiny 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.789
 Well, this guy has the habit of 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.520
 get up the skirt because it is medium 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.159
 gay also breaks chairs and things like that 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.080
 once he hung another from another crane another 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.949
 he once stabbed him with a sword and buried him 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.099
 alive 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.710

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.509

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.180
 annoying like the other but it was more good 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.129
 and it made you laugh about how he talked too 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.169
 I was bill o'neill I was a boy 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.300

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.250
 with the little ones this one 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.169
 characterized by being hit until the 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.110
 death and then get up and them 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.229
 pineapple to its rivals has the answer 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.150

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.360
 mass that is a home builder that 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.469
 they stick with chairs while they eat 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.810
