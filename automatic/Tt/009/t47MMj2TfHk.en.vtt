I look forward I may have spotted some

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
I look forward I may have spotted some
fish<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.340> can't<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:00.940> or<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> want<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.510> wait

for<00:03:01.900> them<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.769> approach<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.970> I'll<00:03:04.090> do<00:03:04.269> is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
for them to approach what I'll do is

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.000 
for them to approach what I'll do is
I'll<00:03:04.569> take<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.959> foot<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.349> push<00:03:05.590> Pole<00:03:05.829> on

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
I'll take the foot of the push Pole on

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.490 
I'll take the foot of the push Pole on
the<00:03:06.069> soft<00:03:06.430> bottom<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.390> I'll<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.900> plant<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the soft bottom and I'll just plant it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.860 
the soft bottom and I'll just plant it
and<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.579> just<00:03:09.610> hold<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.299> boat<00:03:10.480> firmly

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
and I could just hold the boat firmly

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.550 
and I could just hold the boat firmly
and<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:12.190> sit<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.610> wait<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:14.379> get<00:03:14.530> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and just sit and wait so you can get a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.520 
and just sit and wait so you can get a
cast<00:03:14.890> or<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> fish<00:03:15.549> approach<00:03:16.349> let's<00:03:17.349> say

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
cast or the fish approach let's say

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.440 
cast or the fish approach let's say

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
the pole and you just push yourself

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.230 
the pole and you just push yourself
forward<00:04:26.139> gently

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
forward gently

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.379 
forward gently
because<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.050> push<00:04:28.620> too<00:04:28.979> hard<00:04:29.009> then<00:04:30.000> you

because if you push too hard then you

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.300 
because if you push too hard then you
kind<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.780> get<00:04:30.900> stuck<00:04:31.259> on<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.530> bottom<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.039> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
kind of get stuck on the bottom and you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.059 
kind of get stuck on the bottom and you
got<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.520> really<00:04:32.910> push<00:04:33.330> out<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:34.169> foot<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.830> real

I'm going to come down off the tower
I've<00:05:54.210> got<00:05:54.419> what<00:05:54.719> we<00:05:54.810> call<00:05:54.990> a<00:05:55.050> tie<00:05:55.409> off<00:05:55.680> rope

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
I've got what we call a tie off rope

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.570 
I've got what we call a tie off rope
okay<00:05:57.900> which<00:05:58.229> has<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.469> loop<00:05:58.830> on<00:05:59.039> the<00:05:59.219> end

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
okay which has a loop on the end

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.969 
okay which has a loop on the end
and<00:06:00.090> I'll<00:06:00.150> take<00:06:00.389> that<00:06:00.539> loop<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:00.960> depending<00:06:01.830> on

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
and I'll take that loop and depending on

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.279 
and I'll take that loop and depending on
how<00:06:02.580> fast<00:06:02.909> I<00:06:03.180> want<00:06:03.360> to<00:06:03.449> get<00:06:03.570> off<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.840> push<00:06:04.050> pole

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
how fast I want to get off the push pole

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.089 
how fast I want to get off the push pole
I<00:06:04.320> can<00:06:04.620> do<00:06:04.770> this

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
I can do this
