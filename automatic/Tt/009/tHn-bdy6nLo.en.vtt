 This is the first step 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 let's get the perception of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 necessary in each circumstance 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.310

 and of a group of individuals 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.910
 who were expressing their appreciation to that action 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.129
 that is to say things like that 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.129
 conversations 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.949
 a school 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.009

 for the hearing impaired diego copado 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769

 also not 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.349
 he knows how to continue 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.439
 is the ministry of education 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.649
 steps to have a school with that 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.779
 physical that became from yesterday we are inaugurating 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.759
 the school has nine classrooms an innovation classroom with the hotel out a 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:48.899
 multipurpose room a topic and a kitchen is equipped with 144 computers the 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.059
 tonalá program 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.919
 all for children have also given an investment of one million 564 thousand new 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.799
 Suns 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.469
 each 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.229
 love and love the h 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.819
 a special love that you feel when you enter this school 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.799
 from the first moment 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.479
 a love some children 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.969
 with special characteristics 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.589
 that definitely only 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.839
 they can mean love 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:18.329
 and in that sense president I think that the work that has already begun 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.909
 at this school level in this infrastructure is true 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.329
 but that will be developed over two years 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.349
 It's a homework 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.969
 essential to incorporate to have of all the public schools of Peru 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.950
 Inclusive education has seven teachers specialized in care 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.250
 of hearing impairment in the use of sign language and in the 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.970
 Strategies to facilitate the acquisition of oral and written language 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.939
 in addition to an auxiliary 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.569
 got damn 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.759
 and I could stay alive 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.119
 but I think we would dare to say that even Islamic 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.129
 It is the first school 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.369
 with very special characteristics 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.459
 who attended 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
 welcome but if we do not win or local 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.999
 a structure license 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.089
 with cutting edge technology 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.219
 in 2010 the guys that come out of the special pasta 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.719

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.400
 in regular practice 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.250
 Currently the school has 85 children, 50 of whom have 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.580
 auditory disability the educational institution andrés bello de pueblo libre 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.090

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.210
