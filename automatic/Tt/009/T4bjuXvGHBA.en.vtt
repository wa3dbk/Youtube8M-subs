occasionally<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> plant<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> its

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
occasionally a plant would as all of its

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.860 
occasionally a plant would as all of its
leaves<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> absolutely<00:00:46.739> fine

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
leaves but that's absolutely fine

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.700 
leaves but that's absolutely fine
with<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.140> plants<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.559> you're

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
with all these plants when you're

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.139 
with all these plants when you're
cutting<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.160> back<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.820> thing<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cutting them back first thing to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
cutting them back first thing to
remember<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.079> messy<00:00:52.379> work<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
remember is it can be messy work so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.260 
remember is it can be messy work so
dress<00:00:53.460> appropriately

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
dress appropriately

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
dress appropriately
definitely<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.870> Sunday<00:00:55.289> best<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
definitely not Sunday best so with the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
definitely not Sunday best so with the
Venus<00:00:57.180> flytrap<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.989> need<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
Venus flytrap all we need to do is

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
Venus flytrap all we need to do is
remove<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> dead<00:00:59.579> material<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
remove the dead material that's on the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
remove the dead material that's on the
plant<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> leaves<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.710> died<00:01:01.920> back

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
plant and as the leaves have died back

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
plant and as the leaves have died back
entirely<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.390> need<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> pull<00:01:04.290> them

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
entirely all we need to do is pull them

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460 
entirely all we need to do is pull them
out<00:01:04.850> they<00:01:05.850> come<00:01:06.000> off<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.299> easily<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.900> put

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
out they come off pretty easily just put

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
out they come off pretty easily just put
all<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> dead<00:01:08.010> material<00:01:08.189> away<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
all the dead material away from the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
all the dead material away from the
plant<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> main<00:01:10.799> reason<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.159> doing<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
plant the main reason for doing this of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
plant the main reason for doing this of
course<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.840> reduce<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.979> any<00:01:14.250> risk<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
course is to reduce down any risk of the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.140 
course is to reduce down any risk of the
plant<00:01:15.150> rotting<00:01:15.960> over<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> winter<00:01:16.530> months

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
plant rotting over the winter months

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.870 
plant rotting over the winter months
move<00:01:18.150> any<00:01:18.299> dead<00:01:18.540> parts

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.149 

there<00:01:25.450> are<00:01:25.630> notes<00:01:25.869> what<00:01:25.990> were<00:01:26.079> left<00:01:26.259> with<00:01:26.380> the

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
there are notes what were left with the

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.039 
there are notes what were left with the
flat<00:01:27.369> basal<00:01:27.759> rosette<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.570> leaf<00:01:28.780> here

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
flat basal rosette and this leaf here

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.200 
flat basal rosette and this leaf here
which<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.710> rapidly<00:01:30.219> dying<00:01:30.460> back<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:30.969> we<00:01:31.090> can

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
which is is rapidly dying back so we can

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.149 
which is is rapidly dying back so we can
actually<00:01:31.329> remove<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.719> as<00:01:32.020> well<00:01:32.229> so<00:01:32.860> if

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
actually remove that as well so if

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.620 
actually remove that as well so if
you're<00:01:33.310> removing<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.789> leaf<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.210> they're

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
you're removing a leaf this they're

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.690 
you're removing a leaf this they're
still<00:01:34.869> partly<00:01:35.170> live<00:01:35.439> just<00:01:36.159> put<00:01:36.310> your<00:01:36.430> finger

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
still partly live just put your finger

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.160 
still partly live just put your finger
in<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.880> base<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.450> plant<00:01:37.689> in<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.899> middle

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
in the base of the plant in the middle

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.300 
in the base of the plant in the middle
just<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.409> hold<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:38.799> steady

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
just to hold it steady

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.770 
just to hold it steady
and<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:39.969> pull<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.939> theory<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.509> will<00:01:43.630> come

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
and then pull your theory it will come

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.950 
and then pull your theory it will come
out<00:01:43.890> hole

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840 

another<00:01:48.590> type<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:48.860> plant<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.430> serve<00:01:49.820> people

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
another type of plant that serve people

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.970 
another type of plant that serve people
quite<00:01:50.420> often<00:01:50.570> rather<00:01:50.720> Saunders<00:01:51.200> they're<00:01:51.770> some

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
quite often rather Saunders they're some

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.740 
quite often rather Saunders they're some
of<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.130> sons<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.520> South<00:01:52.910> African<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:53.660> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
of the sons of South African and of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.420 
of the sons of South African and of
course<00:01:53.930> therefore<00:01:54.350> they<00:01:54.680> live<00:01:55.070> all<00:01:55.190> year

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
course therefore they live all year

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.640 
course therefore they live all year
round<00:01:55.580> them<00:01:55.910> in<00:01:56.030> full<00:01:56.240> growth<00:01:56.480> some<00:01:57.350> species

round them in full growth some species

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.200 
round them in full growth some species
like<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.040> North<00:01:58.190> American<00:01:58.670> plants<00:01:59.060> are

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
like the North American plants are

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.270 
like the North American plants are
native<00:01:59.390> species<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.260> this<00:02:00.680> one<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.220> is

to to tidy this up as either a pair of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
scissors or I tend to use these for the

topiary shares just to hold the pal and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.810 
topiary shares just to hold the pal and
then<00:02:17.320> give<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.590> pretty<00:02:18.920> severe<00:02:19.340> haircut

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
then give it a pretty severe haircut

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:28.630

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
new ones come through let's start with

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.300 
new ones come through let's start with
sarracenia<00:02:59.180> purpurea<00:02:59.980> now<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.250> a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
sarracenia purpurea now this is a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.890 
sarracenia purpurea now this is a
species<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.850> retains<00:03:02.239> its<00:03:02.390> leaves<00:03:02.600> through

species that retains its leaves through

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.080 
species that retains its leaves through
the<00:03:03.020> winter<00:03:03.290> months

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
the winter months

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.390 
the winter months
and<00:03:04.300> they<00:03:04.420> die<00:03:04.630> off<00:03:04.840> them<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.920> spring<00:03:06.220> as

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
and they die off them in the spring as

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.910 
and they die off them in the spring as
the<00:03:06.520> newest<00:03:06.790> canals<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.240> just<00:03:07.450> said<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.230> this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the newest canals I just said so this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.770 
the newest canals I just said so this
one<00:03:09.160> here<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.760> old<00:03:09.940> leads<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.450> dead<00:03:10.660> were

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
one here the old leads to the dead were

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.120 
one here the old leads to the dead were
actually<00:03:11.050> last<00:03:11.260> year's<00:03:11.560> one<00:03:11.770> it's<00:03:11.890> what<00:03:12.010> we're

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
actually last year's one it's what we're

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.150 
actually last year's one it's what we're
going<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.760> simply<00:03:13.800> support<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.890> plant

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
going to do is simply support the plant

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.420 
going to do is simply support the plant
with<00:03:15.340> your<00:03:15.490> hands<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:15.970> pull<00:03:16.890> clean<00:03:17.890> away<00:03:18.040> from

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
with your hands and pull clean away from

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.720 
with your hands and pull clean away from
the<00:03:18.550> plant<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:20.380> remove<00:03:21.130> each<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.550> dead

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
the plant it remove each of the dead

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.960 
the plant it remove each of the dead
leaves

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.070 

and<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.960> also<00:03:31.050> see<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:32.780> particular<00:03:33.780> cops

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
and you also see this particular cops

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.990 
and you also see this particular cops
got<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> flower<00:03:34.710> stalk<00:03:35.100> on<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.400> as<00:03:35.520> well<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
got a flower stalk on it as well and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.670 
got a flower stalk on it as well and
move<00:03:36.150> out<00:03:36.300> separately<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> minute<00:03:37.110> tend<00:03:37.590> to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
move out separately in a minute tend to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.110 
move out separately in a minute tend to
find<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.070> flower<00:03:38.280> stalks<00:03:38.640> are<00:03:38.790> much<00:03:38.880> tougher

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
find the flower stalks are much tougher

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.640 
find the flower stalks are much tougher
and<00:03:39.420> fibrous<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.990> guess<00:03:40.140> because<00:03:40.320> they've<00:03:40.530> got

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and fibrous I guess because they've got

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.970 
and fibrous I guess because they've got
to<00:03:40.740> be<00:03:40.800> held<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.660> entire<00:03:43.020> growing

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
to be held up in that the entire growing

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190 
to be held up in that the entire growing
season<00:03:44.070> there's<00:03:44.580> no<00:03:44.700> much<00:03:44.880> stronger<00:03:45.270> stronger

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
season there's no much stronger stronger

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.390 
season there's no much stronger stronger
tissue<00:03:47.660> you've<00:03:48.660> removed<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:50.250> old

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400

season than some of the other plants and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.180 
season than some of the other plants and
you<00:04:12.150> tend<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> find<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.870> certainly<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.710> a<00:04:14.010> hot

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190

you tend to find that certainly in a hot
summer<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:15.120> they'll<00:04:15.270> start<00:04:15.570> dying<00:04:15.780> back

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
summer that they'll start dying back

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.410 
summer that they'll start dying back
because<00:04:16.260> early<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.590> all<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:16.920> time<00:04:17.269> now<00:04:18.269> this

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
because early as all this time now this

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.840 
because early as all this time now this
specie<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.019> quite<00:04:19.260> unusual<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.820> fact

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
specie it is quite unusual in the fact

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.280 
specie it is quite unusual in the fact
that<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.329> leaves<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.079> pitcher

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
that the the leaves the pitcher

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.290 
that the the leaves the pitcher
themselves<00:04:22.890> will<00:04:23.010> die<00:04:23.220> back<00:04:23.430> entirely<00:04:24.030> to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
themselves will die back entirely to

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.110 
themselves will die back entirely to
their<00:04:24.450> bases<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.170> lot<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.130> plants<00:04:26.400> will<00:04:26.910> die

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
their bases a lot of the plants will die

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.540 
their bases a lot of the plants will die
back<00:04:27.390> but<00:04:27.690> leave<00:04:27.930> their<00:04:28.230> leaf<00:04:29.010> base<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
back but leave their leaf base of the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.490 
back but leave their leaf base of the
life<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:30.480> this<00:04:30.600> guy<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.900> actually<00:04:31.110> fairly

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
life so this guy is actually fairly

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.290 
life so this guy is actually fairly
straightforward<00:04:31.680> point<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:32.940> again<00:04:33.180> is

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
straightforward point it's do again is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300 
straightforward point it's do again is
foot<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.600> plant<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.470> pull<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.920> leaves<00:04:35.070> out

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
foot the plant and pull the leaves out

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.310 
foot the plant and pull the leaves out
like<00:04:35.460> this<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:36.090> see<00:04:36.330> they'll<00:04:36.810> actually<00:04:36.960> come

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
like this you see they'll actually come

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.190 
like this you see they'll actually come
out<00:04:37.380> with<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.830> leaf<00:04:38.010> base<00:04:38.280> attached<00:04:39.169> simply<00:04:40.169> a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
these leaves if they're little reluctant

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.650 
these leaves if they're little reluctant
this<00:04:47.100> give<00:04:47.250> them<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.370> bit<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.610> twist<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
this give them a bit of a twist that

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.260 
this give them a bit of a twist that
will<00:04:48.810> loosen<00:04:48.930> them<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:50.610> be<00:04:50.760> several<00:04:51.030> at<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.240> time

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
will loosen them to be several at a time

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.830 
will loosen them to be several at a time

they're always sickle shaped which is a

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
good way of identifying this when you're

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.930 
good way of identifying this when you're
comparing<00:05:20.500> with<00:05:20.770> say<00:05:20.950> sarracenia<00:05:21.400> flava<00:05:21.490> some

comparing with say sarracenia flava some
of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.060> clones<00:05:22.300> can<00:05:22.570> be<00:05:22.690> fairly<00:05:22.900> similar<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
of the clones can be fairly similar the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.040 
of the clones can be fairly similar the
the<00:05:24.760> winter<00:05:25.000> leaves<00:05:25.180> in<00:05:25.360> sarracenia<00:05:25.930> flava

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
the winter leaves in sarracenia flava

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.030 
the winter leaves in sarracenia flava
are<00:05:26.920> always<00:05:27.220> sword<00:05:27.760> shapes<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.300> then<00:05:28.420> held<00:05:28.630> up

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
are always sword shapes and then held up

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.520 
are always sword shapes and then held up
in<00:05:30.040> here<00:05:30.250> you<00:05:30.340> see<00:05:30.640> there's<00:05:30.850> a<00:05:30.880> few<00:05:31.530> dead

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
in here you see there's a few dead

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.710 
in here you see there's a few dead
winter<00:05:32.740> leaves<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.760> last<00:05:33.970> winter<00:05:34.570> just

winter leaves the last winter just

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.650 
winter leaves the last winter just

now<00:05:44.349> you<00:05:44.409> can<00:05:44.560> see<00:05:44.710> on<00:05:44.830> here<00:05:45.009> some<00:05:45.400> of<00:05:45.430> the

now you can see on here some of the

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
them have died back to a mid-weight but

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.230 
them have died back to a mid-weight but
obviously<00:05:51.460> we<00:05:51.580> don't<00:05:51.669> want<00:05:51.879> to<00:05:51.969> be<00:05:52.120> in<00:05:52.180> a

here<00:05:57.279> and<00:05:57.490> there<00:05:57.610> really<00:05:58.240> want<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.629> do<00:05:58.900> the

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
here and there really want to do the

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
whole thing in one hit and so I tend to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.170 
whole thing in one hit and so I tend to
leave<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:02.770> plants<00:06:03.099> to<00:06:03.249> early<00:06:03.490> November<00:06:03.639> when

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
leave the plants to early November when

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.879 
leave the plants to early November when
they're<00:06:04.479> looking<00:06:04.569> pretty<00:06:04.779> rough<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:05.710> then

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
they're looking pretty rough and then

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:06.959 
they're looking pretty rough and then
take<00:06:06.069> the<00:06:06.159> whole<00:06:06.370> lot<00:06:06.520> down<00:06:06.729> in<00:06:06.849> their

there's<00:07:06.510> pretty<00:07:06.930> important<00:07:07.380> that<00:07:07.470> you<00:07:07.530> take

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
there's pretty important that you take

there's pretty important that you take
all<00:07:07.950> the<00:07:08.040> dead<00:07:08.220> growth<00:07:08.490> of<00:07:08.730> the<00:07:08.940> plants<00:07:09.270> every
