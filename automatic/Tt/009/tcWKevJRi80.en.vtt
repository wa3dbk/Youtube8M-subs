00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.890 
Bocelli so that was a fun thing but only
thing<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.710> was<00:04:52.310> kind<00:04:52.550> of<00:04:52.750> getting<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
thing that was kind of getting in the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.300 
thing that was kind of getting in the
way<00:04:54.050> is<00:04:54.170> everybody<00:04:54.500> had<00:04:54.620> their<00:04:54.710> own<00:04:54.740> schedule

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
way is everybody had their own schedule

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.170 
way is everybody had their own schedule
so<00:04:55.400> we<00:04:55.490> really<00:04:55.730> couldn't<00:04:55.940> continue

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
so we really couldn't continue

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.960 
so we really couldn't continue
everything<00:04:56.660> like<00:04:56.810> we<00:04:56.930> wanted<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.740> heard<00:04:58.730> it<00:04:58.880> and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
everything like we wanted I heard it and

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.030 
everything like we wanted I heard it and
it<00:04:59.450> was<00:04:59.570> just<00:04:59.600> random<00:04:59.960> then<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:00.320> heard<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.740> and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
it was just random then I heard it and

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.530 
it was just random then I heard it and
