115,000 BTUs and I have three heat zones

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.020 
115,000 BTUs and I have three heat zones
and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.730> hot<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.240> zone<00:01:39.660> that's<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
and then the hot water zone that's the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.710 
and then the hot water zone that's the
pump<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.360> hot<00:01:42.600> water<00:01:42.630> zone<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
pump for the hot water zone just as you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.109

can see goes down into the tank and

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.000 
can see goes down into the tank and
that's<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.390> pump<00:01:51.660> for<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.410> heat<00:01:52.710> zone<00:01:55.010> and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
that's the pump for the heat zone and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.200 
that's the pump for the heat zone and
then<00:01:56.190> I<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> three<00:01:59.220> zones<00:02:00.380> one<00:02:01.380> there

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
