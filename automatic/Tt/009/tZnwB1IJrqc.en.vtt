00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
now been named the wave of the future

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.920 
now been named the wave of the future
wasn't<00:00:15.190> its<00:00:15.400> original<00:00:15.850> name<00:00:16.029> but<00:00:16.299> cook<00:00:16.779> that

wasn't its original name but cook that
up<00:00:17.050> today<00:00:17.199> oh<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:17.740> main<00:00:17.949> difference<00:00:18.400> on<00:00:18.609> this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
up today oh the main difference on this

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.730 
up today oh the main difference on this
bike<00:00:19.000> is<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.570> fort<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.109> whole<00:00:20.289> front<00:00:20.560> end

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
bike is the fort and the whole front end

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.500 
bike is the fort and the whole front end
here<00:00:21.010> we've<00:00:21.310> taken<00:00:21.550> half<00:00:21.880> an<00:00:22.000> inch<00:00:22.150> out<00:00:22.330> of<00:00:22.450> the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
here we've taken half an inch out of the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.050 
here we've taken half an inch out of the
fork<00:00:22.810> so<00:00:23.170> it<00:00:23.320> got<00:00:23.470> less<00:00:23.710> leverage<00:00:24.220> on<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.610> on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
fork so it got less leverage on the on

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.760 
fork so it got less leverage on the on
the<00:00:25.150> crown<00:00:25.390> area<00:00:25.420> so<00:00:25.960> it's<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.140> stronger<00:00:26.410> fork

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
the crown area so it's a stronger fork

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.230 
the crown area so it's a stronger fork
took<00:00:27.039> five<00:00:27.310> eighths<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.670> an<00:00:27.820> inch<00:00:27.880> out<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.150> the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
took five eighths of an inch out of the

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.260 
took five eighths of an inch out of the
head<00:00:28.420> tube<00:00:28.690> so<00:00:29.170> that's<00:00:29.350> a<00:00:29.410> lot<00:00:29.590> lighter<00:00:30.119> 5/8<00:00:31.119> of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
head tube so that's a lot lighter 5/8 of

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.880 
head tube so that's a lot lighter 5/8 of
an<00:00:31.390> inch<00:00:31.480> out<00:00:31.720> of<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.840> steer<00:00:32.079> tube<00:00:32.169> so<00:00:32.649> it's<00:00:32.800> a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
an inch out of the steer tube so it's a

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.350 
an inch out of the steer tube so it's a
lot<00:00:33.070> lighter<00:00:33.280> whole<00:00:33.699> front<00:00:34.000> ends<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.270> little

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
lot lighter whole front ends a little

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.660 
lot lighter whole front ends a little
bit<00:00:34.510> lower<00:00:34.809> than<00:00:34.930> normal<00:00:35.199> but<00:00:35.859> we<00:00:36.010> make<00:00:36.309> up<00:00:36.460> for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
bit lower than normal but we make up for

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.130 
bit lower than normal but we make up for
it<00:00:36.760> with<00:00:36.850> an<00:00:37.000> upright<00:00:37.180> stem<00:00:37.660> which<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:37.899> the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
it with an upright stem which is the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.260 
it with an upright stem which is the
same<00:00:38.320> weight<00:00:38.530> as<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.710> drop<00:00:39.280> stem<00:00:39.610> so<00:00:40.030> that's

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
same weight as a drop stem so that's

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.600 
same weight as a drop stem so that's
almost<00:00:40.810> four<00:00:41.170> inches<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.920> know<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.070> material

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
almost four inches you know a material

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.830 
almost four inches you know a material
they're<00:00:42.820> three<00:00:43.390> inches<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.780> material

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
they're three inches of material

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.569 
they're three inches of material
something<00:00:44.320> like<00:00:44.470> that<00:00:44.649> it's<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:45.010> lot<00:00:45.309> of<00:00:45.460> weight

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
something like that it's a lot of weight

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.549 
something like that it's a lot of weight
savings<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.210> extra<00:00:46.660> strength<00:00:46.989> we've<00:00:47.320> got<00:00:47.440> the

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
savings and extra strength we've got the

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.590 
savings and extra strength we've got the
black<00:00:47.739> hole<00:00:48.040> drop<00:00:48.309> out<00:00:48.579> which<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> solid

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
black hole drop out which is a solid

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.840 
black hole drop out which is a solid
drop<00:00:49.989> out<00:00:50.200> also<00:00:50.710> got<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.920> solid<00:00:51.130> drop<00:00:51.460> out<00:00:51.670> in

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
drop out also got the solid drop out in

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.240 
drop out also got the solid drop out in
