though it's on the ground we see that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.189 
though it's on the ground we see that
there<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.519> vast<00:00:56.150> amount<00:00:56.570> of<00:00:56.659> light<00:00:56.900> coming

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
there is a vast amount of light coming

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.930 
there is a vast amount of light coming
down<00:00:57.440> through<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.220> we<00:00:58.400> all<00:00:58.519> know<00:00:58.549> that<00:00:58.699> in

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
down through so we all know that in

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.090 
down through so we all know that in
transit<00:00:59.479> we<00:00:59.600> all<00:00:59.720> know<00:00:59.869> that<00:00:59.900> and<00:01:00.379> die<00:01:00.559> rise<00:01:00.860> if

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
transit we all know that and die rise if

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.770 
transit we all know that and die rise if
you<00:01:01.190> look<00:01:01.369> into<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.699> sky<00:01:01.820> it's<00:01:02.510> kind<00:01:02.659> of

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
you look into the sky it's kind of

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.439 
you look into the sky it's kind of
cloudy<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:03.320> really<00:01:03.739> effed<00:01:03.949> up<00:01:04.159> looking<00:01:04.640> and

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
cloudy it's really effed up looking and

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.850 
cloudy it's really effed up looking and
the<00:01:05.630> whole<00:01:05.810> reason<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.290> like<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.710> is

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
the whole reason it's like that is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.830 
the whole reason it's like that is
because<00:01:07.250> if<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:07.880> know<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.299> story<00:01:08.600> from

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
because if you know the story from

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.320 
because if you know the story from
zombies<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.530> know<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.970> when<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
Rockets came down and they hit the earth

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.130 
Rockets came down and they hit the earth
had<00:01:13.490> destroyed<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.909> atmosphere<00:01:14.630> which<00:01:14.869> meant

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
had destroyed the atmosphere which meant

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.380

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
this trailer we see if there's a lot of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.060 
this trailer we see if there's a lot of
Sun<00:01:31.700> coming<00:01:31.969> down<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.020> what<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.409> means<00:01:33.710> is

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
Sun coming down so what this means is

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.069 
Sun coming down so what this means is
that<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.640> map<00:01:34.939> takes<00:01:35.179> place<00:01:35.479> in<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.780> past

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
that this map takes place in the past

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.679 
that this map takes place in the past
before<00:01:36.499> the<00:01:36.920> Rockets<00:01:37.310> come<00:01:37.520> down<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.060> if<00:01:38.509> that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
before the Rockets come down and if that

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.539 
before the Rockets come down and if that
does<00:01:38.929> happen<00:01:38.979> then<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.100> means<00:01:40.219> that<00:01:40.340> wreak

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
does happen then it means that wreak

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.429 
does happen then it means that wreak
often<00:01:40.880> really<00:01:41.149> truly<00:01:41.659> has<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> power<00:01:42.229> to

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439

teleport<00:01:42.950> them<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.549> different<00:01:43.729> times<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.990> we

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
teleport them to different times so we

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.929 
teleport them to different times so we
all<00:01:45.469> know<00:01:45.679> that<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.009> teleporter<00:01:46.549> could<00:01:46.729> take

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939

all know that the teleporter could take
them<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.630> different<00:01:47.780> times<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.530> know

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
them to different times you know

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.349 
them to different times you know
shangri-la<00:01:49.399> when<00:01:49.670> they<00:01:49.759> went<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:49.999> kino<00:01:50.329> der

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
shangri-la when they went to kino der

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.389 
shangri-la when they went to kino der
toten<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:51.350> was<00:01:51.499> in<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.740> future<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.310> they

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
toten that was in the future so they

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.660 
toten that was in the future so they
went<00:01:52.579> to<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> future<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:54.170> know<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:54.460> die<00:01:55.460> rise

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
went to the future we know that die rise

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.760 
went to the future we know that die rise
probably<00:01:56.420> takes<00:01:56.689> place<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.259> future

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
probably takes place in the future

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.010 
probably takes place in the future
somewhere<00:01:58.579> near<00:01:58.789> 20<00:01:59.119> 25<00:01:59.539> or<00:01:59.749> at<00:01:59.810> least

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
somewhere near 20 25 or at least

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.919 
somewhere near 20 25 or at least
anywhere<00:02:00.499> past<00:02:01.130> nineteen<00:02:01.700> ninety<00:02:02.149> which<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:02.899> a

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
anywhere past nineteen ninety which is a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.349 
anywhere past nineteen ninety which is a
hell<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.619> lot<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.829> time<00:02:04.130> after<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.939> events

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
hell of a lot of time after the events

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.899 
hell of a lot of time after the events
of<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.990> know<00:02:06.109> the<00:02:06.499> original<00:02:06.619> zombie<00:02:07.340> outbreak

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
of you know the original zombie outbreak

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.580 
of you know the original zombie outbreak
and<00:02:08.060> everything<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:08.899> now<00:02:09.050> we're<00:02:09.200> seeing<00:02:09.500> that

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and everything but now we're seeing that

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.980 
and everything but now we're seeing that
it's<00:02:09.740> actually<00:02:10.039> going<00:02:10.250> back<00:02:10.780> mob<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.930> dead

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
it's actually going back mob of the dead

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.510 
it's actually going back mob of the dead
is<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.380> an<00:02:12.470> official<00:02:12.560> part<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.160> storyline

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
is not an official part of the storyline

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520 
is not an official part of the storyline
and<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.970> kind<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.480> but<00:02:14.510> kind<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.900> not<00:02:14.959> but<00:02:15.440> it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and it kind of is but kind of not but it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.640 
and it kind of is but kind of not but it
doesn't<00:02:15.800> follow<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> official<00:02:16.550> story<00:02:16.760> line

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
doesn't follow the official story line

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.690 
doesn't follow the official story line
so<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.250> first<00:02:19.459> one

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
so this is going to be the first one

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
so this is going to be the first one
made<00:02:19.910> by<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.120> actual<00:02:20.600> zombie<00:02:20.630> team<00:02:21.260> that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
made by the actual zombie team that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.280 
made by the actual zombie team that
covers<00:02:22.210> maybe<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.480> past<00:02:23.750> because<00:02:24.050> we're

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
covers maybe the past because we're

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.120 
covers maybe the past because we're
seeing<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.770> sky

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
seeing the sky

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.550 
seeing the sky
I you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.880> see<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.210> Sun<00:02:26.510> which<00:02:27.080> means<00:02:27.410> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
I you can see the Sun which means that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
I you can see the Sun which means that
we're<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.460> be<00:02:28.610> in<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.940> past

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
we're actually going to be in the past

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.380 
we're actually going to be in the past
again<00:02:29.540> which<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.810> kind<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.410> weird<00:02:30.680> because<00:02:31.390> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
again which is kind of weird because you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.030 
again which is kind of weird because you
know<00:02:32.510> obviously<00:02:32.810> we<00:02:33.230> top<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.590> probably<00:02:33.860> have

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
know obviously we top and probably have

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.670 
know obviously we top and probably have
something<00:02:34.280> plan<00:02:34.640> at<00:02:34.820> this<00:02:34.970> point<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.420> well<00:02:35.680> but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
something plan at this point as well but

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.200 
something plan at this point as well but
if<00:02:36.950> he's<00:02:37.100> in<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.370> past<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:37.940> mean<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
if he's in the past as this mean that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.000 
if he's in the past as this mean that
there's<00:02:38.480> an<00:02:38.600> alternate<00:02:39.140> universe<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.770> well

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
there's an alternate universe as well

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.920 
there's an alternate universe as well
because<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:40.760> he's<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> past<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.810> that

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
because if he's in the past and that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.660 
because if he's in the past and that
means<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.320> they<00:02:42.440> could<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.770> been<00:02:42.980> working

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
means that they could have been working

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.760 
means that they could have been working
on<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.910> zombie<00:02:44.240> outbreak<00:02:44.660> at<00:02:44.840> first<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.740> know

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
on the zombie outbreak at first you know

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.810 
on the zombie outbreak at first you know
but<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.190> trailer<00:02:46.460> we<00:02:46.550> see<00:02:46.580> that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
but in the trailer we see that

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.810 
but in the trailer we see that
Richthofen<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.660> control<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.220> is<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.700> an

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
Richthofen is in control so is this an

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.250 
Richthofen is in control so is this an
alternate<00:02:50.270> universe<00:02:50.300> that's<00:02:50.840> going<00:02:51.110> on

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
alternate universe that's going on

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.440 
alternate universe that's going on
because<00:02:51.740> if<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.040> go<00:02:52.070> into<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.490> past<00:02:52.730> chances

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
because if you go into the past chances

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.470 
because if you go into the past chances
are<00:02:53.570> samantha<00:02:54.020> has<00:02:54.170> control<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.710> past<00:02:54.950> or

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
are samantha has control in the past or

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.670 
are samantha has control in the past or
you<00:02:56.480> know<00:02:56.600> zombies<00:02:56.900> weren't<00:02:57.230> even<00:02:57.410> there<00:02:57.560> in

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
you know zombies weren't even there in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.100 
you know zombies weren't even there in
the<00:02:57.770> past<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.190> suddenly<00:02:58.460> we're<00:02:58.760> seeing

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the past but suddenly we're seeing

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.060 
the past but suddenly we're seeing
Richthofen<00:03:00.110> having<00:03:00.320> control<00:03:00.650> during<00:03:00.830> that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
Richthofen having control during that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.940 
Richthofen having control during that
period<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.330> it's<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.540> little<00:03:02.660> strange<00:03:02.990> we're

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
period so it's a little strange we're

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.680 
period so it's a little strange we're
going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> have<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.490> wait<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.790> see<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.330> see
