 same as the new the lords of shadow ' 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.530
 but the interesting thing is that the new 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.449
 castlevania lords of shadow 'was also 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 developed by kojima productions the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.719
 creators of metal gear solid 'and for that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.640
 same reason is that they can be found 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.130
 some curiosities of metal gear 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.320
 solid 'inside the lords of shadow' a 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.090
 of 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.979
 is that after completing the game in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.229
 normal mode it is possible to unlock a 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.120
 bandana and an eye patch equal to the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.710
 you have naked metal gear solid box 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.030
 and again a fragment of a song 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.320
 metal gear solid 'that can be 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.610
 listen in the background when you're 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.610
 advancing again from the levels 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.550
 a short curiosity inside donkey 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.290
 kong country returns is that one of the 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.840
 levels can be found in the background 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.760
 to mister game and watch another curiosity 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.080
 short is that the game such of symphony 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.300
 in one of the maps you can find 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.890
 several ice statues of one of the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.050
 statues that can be found in this 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.460
 statues park is that of pacman other 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.710
 curiosity that we can find in 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.300
 sonic generations is that within the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.880
 city ​​you can find some 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.290
 posters of lost people or animals or 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.060
 whatever they are but these posters 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.220
 they contain two characters in particular 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.410
 these characters are the characters of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.910
 mighty the armadillo and rai the squirrel 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.740
 flying which will be characters 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.630
 old series of sonic games 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.979
 that have not appeared in many years 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.300
 within the games so the 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.950
 creators decided to put it there as 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.570
 reference or as a way of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 remember it since you have not seen a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.260
 game for many years now what 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.450
 so if we are going to talk about gta san 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.370
 andreas within the game can be 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.350
 find giant posters in the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.480
 which have advertising for a service 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.030
 of waste the name of this service 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 it's truck grains street cleaners the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.570
 name the color of the letters and the form 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.400
 of the letters implies that this is 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.560
 a reference to the game true crime 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.530
 many people considered of the moment 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.599
 it was a kind of gta clone since 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 at the time he came out general was 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.349
 almost the only sandbox game that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.000
 there was or at least the most popular 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.560
 Not to mention that both games 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.540
 they shared the subject of criminal life 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 but since we're talking about gta 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.190
 because we do not move to the most recent and 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.170
 let's talk about gta 5 the history of 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.970
 gta is always related to life 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.790
 of the criminals and to add 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.620
 rockstar authenticity for gta 5 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.819
 they hired true criminals to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.920
 make the voices of various characters 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.870
 within the game so much so that one of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.180
 the actors was let out of prison 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.340
 the day before he went to record his 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.319
 lines for the game a reference that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.510
 can be found inside gta 5 is 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.480
 that there is a very small random chance 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.830
 that when I change to trevor these 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410
 randomly what he is doing 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.750
 Clover is they are giving for a scooter 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.830
 behind another guy and screaming that they are 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830
 the brothers scooters 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 this is a reference to a very video 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.209
 popular that was made a few years ago 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.950
 gta 4 in which a guy shouted that 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.400
 were brothers listen with a character 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 n bs 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.120
 mercedes promover 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.230
 Photos 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.840
 when I'm in agreement 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.930
 doctor the tunnel 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.090
 if tressor continues driving next to 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.799
 this character will continue to say things 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.799
 he says they also said in the video 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.100
 Y 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.930
 another curiosity is that within the game 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.330
 on the map known as monte gordo is 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.830
 possible to find a ghost that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.500
 can only be found among 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.660
 11 am and 12 pm this ghost is 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.460
 the ghost of the lion now johnson the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.320
 which is a fictional actress within the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.000
 gta world that had a very history 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.070
 sad about a murder that happened does 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.450
 many years its history plays a role 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.040
 quite interesting inside the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.840
 history of gta since within all the 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.880
 game you can find certain notes 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 left by her if you manage to collect 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.630
 the 50 notes you can unlock a 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.580
 secondary mission but so you can 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.110
 find your ghost at night do not know 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.760
 can interpret in any way with 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
 this ghost if he shoots him does not happen to him 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.090
 nothing and if you get too close to 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.150
 ghost simply disappears leaving 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.530
 a floor blood script another 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.510
 supernatural thing that can be found 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.040
 within the game is that at the beginning of 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.870
 game during the prologue of which the 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.030
 high a bank and after escaping from 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.040
 the police is that if you deviate and pass 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.050
 by the river that is frozen you can 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.360
 approach the ice and see an alien that is 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.980
 frozen under the ice but if that does not 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.630
 hidden enough for you is 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.790
 who is also comfortable in real life 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.979
 the special editions and of 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.449
 gta 5 collectors came with 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.550
 several extras one of them 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.770
 being a plane of the entire city of the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.360
 saints this blue plane has a 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.159
 pretty special feature there 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.749
 it only acts as a game map but 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.849
 that if you put it down in the light 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.889
 ultraviolet can reveal secrets and 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.569
 hidden things within the game the map 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.180
 is not 100% clear in everything that is 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.710
 hidden within the re marks but 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.449
 some of the things that brands are for 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.520
 example the parts of the UFO ships 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.559
 some weapons hidden in places 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.270
 specials and briefcases filled with 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.830
 money also seems to indicate the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.210
 location of some of the UFO vessels 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.279
 that can be found within the game 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.689
 It should be noted that the back of the 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.520
 map with the naked eye can not be 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.009
 find nothing but if one puts the light 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.680
 ultraviolet says trevor phillips 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.719
 industries or enterprise which seems 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.849
 indicate that this map is trevor and that 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.379
 all these marks were made by him 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.330
 another supernatural thing that can be 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.939
 to do in the game is to find 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.219
 big foot many rumors came up about 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.110
 gta san andreas that had a big foot 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.819
 inside but this time what rockstar 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.770
 they put one really and in a way 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.749
 very similar to how they did in network 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.550
 dead redemption this is a mission 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.379
 secondary that can only be done 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.539
 after having completed 100% the 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.380
 game you have to walk in the mountains 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.030
 to find 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.620
 an old logo that is hunting feet 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.930
 great and he talks about who has seen them 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.370
 and all those things this guy appears at 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.810
 chance but swim with him they started the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.210
 mission in which you have to marry the 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.680
 last sha car that there is or at least 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.450
 that they want us to create since all 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.460
 we know that the last big spy was 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.140
 killed by John Marston at the end 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.570
 the big fur hunt to be able 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.250
 ends up being a guy with a mask and 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.360
 to finish we will see one more glitch 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.010
 that a curiosity can be to 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.390
 purpose within the game 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.010
 remember that four good card 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.330
 swing from which when one threw out 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.830
 a car could make it fly 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.840
 in all the city 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.670
 well in gta 5 something similar 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.380
 you can achieve you just have to go to 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.460
 any place where there may be a 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.920
 door that closes automatically 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.660
 sideways not up like the 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.980
 most of the suits what you have to 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.380
 to do is when the door is open 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.300
 accelerates against it and keep accelerating 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.610
 until the door begins to close 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.200
 and if they are lucky and their car is 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.700
 caught between the door 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.920
 closing and one of the pillars of the 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.080
 The car's grate will fly off if you do not 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.270
 usually the first try many times 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.250
 because this trick is quite difficult to 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.170
 that comes out I tell them in itself that if 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.210
 they are going to try to take many 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.050
 many attempts to do it but if what 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.720
 they achieve 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.819
 spectacular results and if 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.470
 they manage to do it high they carry a parachute 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.470
 because the author is the protagonist 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.009
