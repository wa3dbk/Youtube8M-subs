00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello dear audience heartily 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 Welcome to a new episode of mine 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.210
 ship tv we already have some times 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920
 about the area kids teens and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 edutainment on my ship lotte 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.520
 reported because Tui Cruises is it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 important to me not only the parents 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.850
 Board feel good but also the children 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.710
 spend a nice holiday 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.570
 the carers take on regular 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 training and just found one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.550
 such further education here in hamburg 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.350
 instead of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.869
 we from our ship tv were there 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.920
 and show them today, among other things 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.850
 like a real mermaid 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.850
 can swim 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.430
 today is the training of the kids and 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.170
 teens careers instead of there they will 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.490
 prepared for the my boat fleet 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.260
 among other things, they learn, for example 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.910
 as she is a high school musical on board 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.310
 implement or as you for example that 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.520
 football camp with the kids to run 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.520
 bring 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.150
 you will probably be the first 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.070
 two and a half hours need to 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.160
 to teach the choreography and have 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 her a unit for acting or 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.660
 said that high school musical is im 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.490
 principle a new project what now 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.710
 Tried out for the summer months 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.470
 The carers learn the original today 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.790
 choreography from the movie soja and bis 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.550
 to like what's going on in the background right now 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.560
 Listen and how to playacting scenes 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.080
 tinkering what you have to consider how much 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 text so the children can expect so 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.280
 regulate the stage 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.710
 the most important aspect is the care provider 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.930
 Once this structure is the one to learn 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.870
 methodically didactically successful 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.190
 to implement on board an example is that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.500
 For example, in the first unit 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.130
 getting acquainted with the games 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.130
 to strengthen team spirit 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.400
 furthermore, they learn basic things 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.540
 skills and abilities 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.210
 Sports specific to the event football too 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.190
 recognize it and then in the exercise room and 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.750
 implement such a way that the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.890
 Children are also worth more 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.540
 take camp 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.880
 the football camp will be on board 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.390
 as well as on land instead of now on the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.380
 my ship 3 is a huge one 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.380
 Multi-function court available 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.599
 in another training it was said 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.310
 the caretaker off to the swimming pool 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.959
 because on board my ship 3 it will be 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.389
 swimming the course like a mermaid 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.019
 give and what lies behind that 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.019
 we show them now 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.080
 Mermaid swimming is a trend 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.900
 from the USA 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.110
 and yes that's a monofin that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.840
 is connected in a suit of the same 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.880
 looks like a mermaid and every one 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 Of course, watching TV would like something like that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.290
 give it a try 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.360
 So it will be on my ship three 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
