this it's a material that's been around

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
this it's a material that's been around
for<00:00:41.670> quite<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.660> long<00:00:42.960> time

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
for quite a long time

it's<00:00:43.890> called<00:00:44.100> foam<00:00:44.309> latex<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.180> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
it's called foam latex but this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's called foam latex but this
formulation<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.710> incarnation<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
formulation this incarnation of it is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.900 
formulation this incarnation of it is
has<00:00:48.629> been<00:00:48.780> refined<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> sort<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.250> reinvented

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
has been refined and sort of reinvented

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.020 
has been refined and sort of reinvented
to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.989> more<00:00:52.289> supple<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.980> durable<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.670> what

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to be more supple more durable so what

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.720 
to be more supple more durable so what
was<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> biggest<00:00:54.510> challenge<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.489> guess<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
was the biggest challenge I guess one of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.840 
was the biggest challenge I guess one of
the<00:00:56.789> biggest<00:00:57.059> challenges<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.850> guy

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the biggest challenges was to make a guy

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
the biggest challenges was to make a guy
who's<00:01:00.120> supposed<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.570> made<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> rock<00:01:01.280> be

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
who's supposed to be made out of rock be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.340 
who's supposed to be made out of rock be
able<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.199> like

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
able to move and not have it look like

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
able to move and not have it look like
rubber<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> doesn't<00:01:05.790> look

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
rubber you know so that it doesn't look

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
rubber you know so that it doesn't look
like<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.659> forms<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.470> buckling<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like the forms are buckling and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
like the forms are buckling and
stretching<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.939> shifting<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:09.750> long<00:01:09.900> did

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
stretching and shifting so how long did

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
stretching and shifting so how long did
it<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> customs<00:01:11.670> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it take to actually get the customs on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.990 
it take to actually get the customs on
and<00:01:12.119> off<00:01:12.680> finally<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.850> our

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and off finally when we got in our

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
and off finally when we got in our
stride<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.509> took<00:01:15.630> us<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:15.900> two<00:01:16.080> hours<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.500> get

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
stride it took us about two hours to get

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.100

takes a bite out of a banana and he
actually<00:01:41.640> uses<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.299> chew<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
actually uses these to chew it so so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
actually uses these to chew it so so
those<00:01:43.829> were<00:01:43.950> very<00:01:44.009> functional<00:01:44.610> anyway<00:01:45.060> um

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
those were very functional anyway um

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
those were very functional anyway um
your<00:01:45.930> hands<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.619> were<00:01:46.740> similar<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> these

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
your hands that were similar to these

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
your hands that were similar to these

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
but you feel that yeah this is we're

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.070 
but you feel that yeah this is we're
about<00:01:49.380> evil
