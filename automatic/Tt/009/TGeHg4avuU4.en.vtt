using<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.259> camera<00:00:13.469> phone<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.740> looked

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
using my camera phone and looked

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
using my camera phone and looked
terrible<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.299> time<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.599> captured<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
terrible so this time it's captured to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.769 
terrible so this time it's captured to
look<00:00:16.199> good<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.340> go<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> arson<00:00:18.060> desk<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
look good so we go to the arson desk and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300 
look good so we go to the arson desk and
you<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.020> select<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> case<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:20.100> but

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you can select the case if you want but

you can select the case if you want but
if<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.460> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.640> go<00:00:20.730> straight<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.180> it's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
if you want to go straight to it it's

faster if you just go to the streets of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.630 
faster if you just go to the streets of
LA<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.490> free<00:00:23.670> roam<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.060> added<00:00:24.810> aloud<00:00:25.109> the

loading here you just go to your map you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
loading here you just go to your map you
can<00:00:29.400> use<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> RB<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.090> lb<00:00:30.300> buttons<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.840> just

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
can use the RB and lb buttons to just

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.450 
can use the RB and lb buttons to just
jump<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.590> street<00:00:31.890> crime<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> other

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
jump from one street crime to the other

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389

so<00:00:32.730> keep<00:00:33.059> pressing<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:33.780> B<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.110> lb<00:00:34.590> until<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
so keep pressing or B or lb until it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270 
so keep pressing or B or lb until it
selects<00:00:35.760> hot<00:00:36.329> property<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.010> street

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

crime we looking for here there we go I

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
crime we looking for here there we go I
just<00:00:42.149> selected<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.690> pressing<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
little faster I don't know why but you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
little faster I don't know why but you
spawn<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> someone's<00:00:59.760> driver<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

just drive straight to it now I'm gonna
tell<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.990> exactly<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.530> reproduce<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
tell you exactly how to reproduce this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.780 
tell you exactly how to reproduce this
one<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> few<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.950> seem<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
one there are a few things that seem to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
one there are a few things that seem to
be<00:01:11.909> essential<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:13.830> did<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.310> mention<00:01:14.460> them

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
be essential and I did not mention them

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.490 
be essential and I did not mention them
the<00:01:14.820> first<00:01:14.970> time<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:15.390> didn't<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the first time because i didn't know but

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
the first time because i didn't know but
when<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.650> tried<00:01:16.920> reproducing<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
when i tried reproducing is for the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
when i tried reproducing is for the
purpose<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.420> capture<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:19.080> realized<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
purpose of this capture i realized that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730 
purpose of this capture i realized that
there<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.740> very

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
there was a little more to it so very

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
there was a little more to it so very
simply<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.430> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:24.090> start<00:01:24.390> hold<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
simply put when you first start hold a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
simply put when you first start hold a
gas<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.470> away<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> make<00:01:26.040> sure<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> keep<00:01:26.430> up

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gas right away to make sure you keep up

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.620 
gas right away to make sure you keep up
with<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.270> too<00:01:27.450> far

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with them because if you're too far

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.359 
with them because if you're too far
behind<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> fail<00:01:29.189> your

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
behind you're just going to fail your

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.390 
behind you're just going to fail your
case<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.790> away<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.600> floor<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.250> right<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
case right away so floor it right at the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
case right away so floor it right at the
corner<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.180> either<00:01:33.390> hit<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> pole

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
corner you have to either hit the pole

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
corner you have to either hit the pole
with<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.180> going

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
with the light or actually just going

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.080 
with the light or actually just going
between<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.189> stop<00:01:38.579> right

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
between there we go and then stop right

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
between there we go and then stop right
here<00:01:39.390> try<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> hit<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> hedge<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.950> much

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
here try to hit the hedge it's much

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.039 
here try to hit the hedge it's much
easier<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:42.000> you've<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
easier but you've got to make sure you

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
easier but you've got to make sure you
do<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.500> end<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.549> parking<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
do not end up in the parking lot if you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
do not end up in the parking lot if you
cross<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> line<00:01:46.470> between<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.159> gray<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
cross that line between the gray and the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
cross that line between the gray and the
grey<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
grey or and if you can see that on the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
grey or and if you can see that on the
bottom<00:01:49.200> left<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.490> get

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
bottom left they are if you actually get

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.520 
bottom left they are if you actually get
into<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.090> parking<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.630> whenever<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> try<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
into the parking lot whenever you try to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.750 
into the parking lot whenever you try to
get<00:01:52.710> into<00:01:52.890> custom<00:01:53.220> packard<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> says<00:01:53.970> case<00:01:54.210> fan

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
get into custom packard it says case fan

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.580 
get into custom packard it says case fan
now<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.270> don't<00:01:55.450> know<00:01:55.600> why<00:01:55.750> but<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.200> seems<00:01:56.410> to

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
now I don't know why but that seems to

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.190 
now I don't know why but that seems to
be<00:01:56.740> part<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.150> take<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.570> car<00:01:58.750> drive<00:01:59.170> away

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
be part of it so take the car drive away

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.120 
be part of it so take the car drive away
take<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.040> right<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.750> poof<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:02.080> just<00:02:02.530> disappears

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
take a right and poof it just disappears

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.010 
take a right and poof it just disappears
I<00:02:03.400> don't<00:02:04.150> know<00:02:04.210> why<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.390> happens<00:02:04.840> but

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
I don't know why this happens but

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.410 
I don't know why this happens but
actually<00:02:05.440> when<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.800> car<00:02:06.010> disappears<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:07.240> can

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
actually when the car disappears you can

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.790 
actually when the car disappears you can
feel<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.720> because<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:08.200> controller<00:02:08.560> vibrates

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
feel it because your controller vibrates

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.040 
feel it because your controller vibrates
so<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:10.149> game<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.330> definitely<00:02:10.600> doing

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
so the game is definitely doing

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.540 
so the game is definitely doing
something<00:02:11.080> i'm<00:02:11.680> not<00:02:11.830> sure<00:02:11.980> what<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.280> i<00:02:12.400> mean

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
something i'm not sure what it is i mean

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.490 
something i'm not sure what it is i mean
you<00:02:12.760> find<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.210> fail<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:13.780> case<00:02:13.960> but<00:02:14.230> i<00:02:14.290> don't

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
you find you fail your case but i don't

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.010 
you find you fail your case but i don't
know<00:02:14.590> why<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.830> needs<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:16.240> make<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.750> car

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
know why it needs to make that car

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.840 
know why it needs to make that car
disappear<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.220> anyways<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
disappear so anyways that's the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.790 
disappear so anyways that's the
