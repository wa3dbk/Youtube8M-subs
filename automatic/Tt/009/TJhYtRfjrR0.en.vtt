00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.929
 Good morning, everybody, let's introduce our 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.779
 room 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:15.120
 a dream that comes beyond the chorus I get 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:18.359
 I 'm just staying here and call. 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.810
 we are very close to the end the actor 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 we got to our court here we have one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:39.800
 million of entry so that in our 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.800
 house are worth as the yard and commands 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:01:08.540
 has not been used yet and to make things 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:37.790
 we entered the part of the room friendly to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:02:03.210
 will and clear face and into the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:02:05.899
 case of the duel where we have more and we 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.899
 some quality 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.540
 the most interesting part is the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.890
 balcony 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.460
 we then arrived at the balcony to wake up 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.460
 with these visits 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.310
 what 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.570
 to get a sense of the distance 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.910
 we are in the poker tournament solving 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.430
 in a building with a native flag 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.980
 I think you can see the little training is 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.440
 prove that difficult but we're going to 25 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.810
 minutes later I found the production 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.150
 sacrifice and we have to do 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.710
 and while we're going to do now, 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.160
 will cost this increase we can not 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.820
 to be in the pool but we have to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.820
 kiss
