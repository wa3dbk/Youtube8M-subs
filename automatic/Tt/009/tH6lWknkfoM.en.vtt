 they wanted to use everything they had 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 we discovered that there was no 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.059
 a closed set that all areas 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.150
 commons that had even offered us

 municipality are not owned by 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 rest of the common say that the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 construction company closed the public space 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.280
 to sell it which surprised us 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.060
 very much for us in the area 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.980
 in the promise of sale was given by 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.680
 sitting down we were buying a 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.600
 controller who had his own 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.760
 registered horizontal discovered that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 apparently the builder sold them 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.780
 areas that he could never acquire but as 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.400
 she was already engaged she created some 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 closed real estate units that 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.040
 they were also accepted by the mayor's office 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 He accepted the jury and registered them on 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.150
 Mr. recorder of instruments 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.490
 public in 2007 three years after 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.649
 have bought their homes the 120 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.180
 neighboring families were convinced that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.180
 they had less than they thought 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.420
 we buy a house in the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.739
 set closed but not deeded 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.290
 Well, if that was what the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.260
 buy and sell a lot 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.629
 with delays a lot with a house the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.879
 wrong things that were done with the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.609
 acquiescence of the administration 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.129
 municipal municipal planning 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.620
 mayoralty of the curators of the 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.689
 Notaries have already spent eight years 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.549
 people who represent others also 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.439
 dissatisfied and who prefer not to report 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.230
 publicly to avoid discomfort 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.510
 with local government officials 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.970
 they resorted to justice we are with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.919
 They come from a lawsuit for fraud offense 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.040
 as a mass crime because then the 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:04.879
 affected we are therefore in total around 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.910
 of 150 200 people the plaintiffs then 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.910
 we are 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.430
 a little less five years ago they tried 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.020
 conciliate and since then they have not been able to 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.840
 reach any agreement with the owner of 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.060
 the construction for three months the

 I tried to interview the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.980
 representatives of the construction company and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.900
 City Hall officials who would have 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 some competition in the subject but not 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.460
 have agreed to refer to the allegations 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.440
