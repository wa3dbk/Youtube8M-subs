 fabio tv this week numbers 28 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.849
 Twenty-eighth of this year that we 've already passed 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.589
 half and obviously we have left 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.450
 less year still ahead but 1 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.490
 we started in this way 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.050
 Arango the comic-con with everything obviously 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 a lot of trailers a lot of things 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 that we're going to lose that we're 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.570
 losing we have for example 201 days 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 continued fox that is 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.620
 transmitting ex country as it comes the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 new movie of spider-man zaire with 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.780
 the same protagonists of always there 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.400
 200 are continuous continuous chapters 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 and every day for dad to 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.320
 machine gun with the old chapters 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.400
 I have a lot of faith in the new one but 20 a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.900
 bunch of series for example we have 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.879
 player of the walking dead that is going to 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.960
 cost to see it because the amc what 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.790
 they want for the rest of the world only they 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 can see enter the us if they need it 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.810
 0 notifies told me up the last part of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.940
 hunger games' the movie has its 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.380
 trailer they have for trailers but good 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 has like a teaser so kind for 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.980
 incite a poronga but it does not matter 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 Filmed movies like Agus Booms 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.290
 'doctor who' new season and for 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.660
 luck and already the hype of this I do not know how 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.790
 handle it star war has an excellent 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.740
 video of the fourth awaking of how it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 is making the movie to me and I 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 is splitting the head is also 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 too much height for a movie that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.820
 there are still many months left but it is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.770
 star wars and I can not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.659
 and not only russia inflate the games in the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 north sea in the Baltic but that 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.960
 also for July 4 the 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.729
 American independence did what 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.350
 same to go for a ride with planes 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.510
 by on the alaska coast and from 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.220
 california always say for the pacific 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.720
 always in international waters but 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.040
 to force the Americans to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.350
 have to get on the planes and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.210
 intercept the good obviously are 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.979
 puffing up the eggs the Norwegians 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.280
 they intercepted them in the north of this 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.280
 shape 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.480
 and they remember the wick challenge that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.400
 they made Americans in the 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.840
 Japanese last week well this 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.700
 week the Japanese responded 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.950
 another Americans but listen to me the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.230
 wrestle fights japan do not come to say to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.100
 me how to play it if you give games to zero 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.100
 peak hours 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 and today for the son of a bitch of the week 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.220
 we have two things and the son of a bitch 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.440
 and the one who is not a son of a bitch is once 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.930
 Chinese reason eating a heinous grime down 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.489
 all sides and do not leave it and this one 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 undertook in lucas lucas to steal crazy 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.420
 117 sent it to me that is one goal 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.709
 I was busy that it will settle one 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.180
 old man to be taken collectively for 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.220
 school for the other side because it was passed 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.750
 long is the web type in the week if 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.750
 we have the son of a bitch and that makes up for 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.660
 and in our Japan music section 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.020
 because they explain why japan does not 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.020
 can understand 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.100
 this week we have a very good 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.230
 humor section we can four 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.070
 excellent videos first we will start 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.560
 with a house 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.350
 page as you can travel in nine motorcycles 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.170
 two men without being extremely few 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.060
 this other short bull and simÃ³n one minute 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.950
 time machine a time machine that 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.510
 makes you come back two minutes ago but 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.070
 has its consequences its serious 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.600
 consequences the type tries to lift 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.220
 and it's not going very well for cooks 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.370
 We have seven ways to cut one 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.960
 onions will suffer watching this video and for 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.880
 far the best to hate the trailer of 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.680
 sculptures in world that for a Korean 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.680
 in which if you do not act all together 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.890
 in addition space frees and sustained a 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.990
 little niggle during the end of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.850
 last week when I finished my video of 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.620
 soon disconnected from images was 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.410
 within a week of reaching pluton and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.600
 disconnect all good light trouble 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.250
 they managed to recover repressor the ship 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.560
 He said hear I have a little problem to be 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.820
 reactive and during these days in addition to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.590
 Test that everything is working 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.540
 correctly and they will not touch anything else 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.430
 the ship is approaching the proton 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.050
 chang when at the time of recording this 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.110
 it's three days away from reaching proton 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.030
 soon dayz reach the proton you can see the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.260
 geology in the distance we are talking 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.080
 several million kilometers still 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.670
 but it will happen at very close range 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.290
 between Monday and Tuesday we will have 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.970
 the closest step obviously is not going 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.130
 show all the proton information 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.630
 let's have a few months following because 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.980
 they have start transmitting after all 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.600
 the information roll that captures but 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.910
 at least booster photos at close range 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.200
 of the proton for me is amazing these 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.360
 guys this is a historic moment 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.890
 remember and we have a takeoff this 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 Indian week launches the biggest rocket of 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.420
 them a rocket with 1400 kilos of cargo 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.370
 It is not very big compared to other 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.110
 but the truth is that to throw without things 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.450
 of him from that same very good mission 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.709
 mission of the Indians much cheaper 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.720
 that's why the British launch the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.190
 satellites with them this I do not know what 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.690
 utility has but it is a time that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.389
 put together a gear system one 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.710
 reduction from 1 to 11 million I do not know for 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.479
 what's the use but basically with exams 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.880
 and is giving him giving and giving him could 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.790
 move I do not know a change in giant here 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.169
 a few years but it serves for that already 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.810
 we want a European project of the 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.370
 Polytechnical School of Lausanne which 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.080
 have an idea of how you capture things in 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.520
 spaces micro satellite machines that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.950
 they are spinning little bits are giving 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.600
 turns that does not work anymore and also the 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.880
 fart good spatial junk instead of 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.620
 use a robotic arm 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.910
 the idea is to use a large bag of 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.910
 cosmic waste 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.169
 good the videos of this week we have 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.759
 For example, like a vinyl with a 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.349
 tortilla tortilla of the mexicanas nothing 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.759
 with which he makes us some delicious tacos 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.759
 it can be a vinyl 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.000
 I think there's nothing bigger than this 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.000
 but good 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.439
 bolt in tpa in five types and is about 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.339
 the times of winning this little one the 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.339
 it has very clear 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.730
 and the one that goes by running chopped things 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.590
 that they do not go gogh for anything good you know 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.120
 that the nitro exploded and we followed everything 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.120
 the little car that shit 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.620
 and for the ferrets we have this 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.030
 exercise of the Danish air force that 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.700
 is Hispanic and the wind prayers and 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.980
 run to the planes like the missiles 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.290
 It is an excellent video of how to work 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.419
 a f-16 are actually running 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.419
 germany and in the vineyard nobody found out 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.699
 and it 's good because it's for the 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.960
 fans of the games of the formula 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.639
 one of the sports because for example 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.830
 let's give fernando alonso running with his 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.509
 own simulator as he plays with 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.000
 people to joana be practicing 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.380
 really a formula race one the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.699
 steering wheel obviously is not the one 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.320
 can get on hits that do not 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.699
 you can get to get it but it's a 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 Formula One flyer with all the 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.259
 very complicated controls that the 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.060
 fuel mixture then a lot 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.710
 of things that flyer but in a 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.900
 simulator that said basically arrived 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.550
 louis like any second no 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.199
 can get to play the computer is 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.449
 and they have joined the two roads in the 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.090
 simulator and in the game obviously you 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.440
 I want to see play with no help and 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.449
 have to pay for the changes as 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.199
 it corresponds and I will never skate that I do not 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.199
 I can do it for example 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.850
 well this is all for this week there was 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.840
 pretty way very good impression of 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.400
 done the humor section I lost 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.470
 has four excellent videos are not 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.060
 lose see new are worth all 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.349
 in real for the penalty all that I put them 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.389
 here because if I do not rule it out I do not 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:52.340
 Interesting point crap do not go back to 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.789
 that comes down here all the 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.710
 links in the recent video obviously 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.330
 leave your dear vote positive favor or 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.130
 let him not give equal 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.870
 see you next week with more 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.099
 exclusion to anything he wants 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.419
 send me on track for a week and the 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.419
 we try to include in the video
