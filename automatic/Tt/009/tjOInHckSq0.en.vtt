00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
why am I talking about the store and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.840 
why am I talking about the store and
it's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> doesn't<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> same<00:00:53.280> cut<00:00:53.610> up

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

here as this didn't used to have so it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.250

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
and don't forget that you have to try it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.550 
and don't forget that you have to try it
on<00:02:59.120> every<00:02:59.390> now<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.660> then<00:02:59.780> till<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.140> see<00:03:00.440> how

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
it some phones just going to follow it

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.600 
it some phones just going to follow it
like<00:05:06.030> this<00:05:06.300> just<00:05:06.719> a<00:05:06.810> little<00:05:06.900> bit<00:05:07.050> deeper

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.550 

you're<00:05:11.610> going<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:11.849> see<00:05:12.030> their<00:05:12.389> solvent<00:05:12.840> fusing

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
you're going to see their solvent fusing

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.399 
you're going to see their solvent fusing
it<00:05:13.729> so<00:05:14.729> when<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.060> cut<00:05:15.300> this<00:05:15.479> I'm<00:05:15.750> probably<00:05:16.110> going

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
it so when I cut this I'm probably going

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.119 
it so when I cut this I'm probably going
to<00:05:16.500> see<00:05:16.620> as<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:17.129> see<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.789> front<00:05:18.889> you<00:05:19.889> see
