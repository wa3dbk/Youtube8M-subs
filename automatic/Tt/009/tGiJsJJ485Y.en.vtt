 hi to all it's steven but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.820
 today I will explain 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.679
 how to jailbreak ios the 8th 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.500
 0 points currently 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.630
 it is a type jailbreak 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 untethered so a complete jailbreak 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.170
 compatible with the iphone 6 the ciss more 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.880
 the iphone 5 aces 5 4s the ipod touch 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.680
 fifth generation and all models 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 from ipod even those who came out there are 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 a few days so I will show you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.440
 how to make this ayo jailbreak and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.239
 Eventually you can use a device 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.860
 who has a lot of things installed on it or 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.660
 then nothing is not embarrassing 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.340
 since the jailbreak will not delete anything 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 to start you plug your 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 device to your computer with the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 usb dock cable and then in the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.530
 settings you go here in touch 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 heidi and codes there you enter your code 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 security if you have one and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 especially you disable it so remove 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 your lock code and touch 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 heidi and then you go into 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 the icloud section is there if you have 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.490
 an account to connect you can 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 leave connected but mostly you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.000
 disable the locate my iphone otherwise 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 you can not continue the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 jailbreak is then on itunes you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 make sure you have the right 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 last version 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.400
 so me when I 'm doing this 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 video it's the 12 points 0.1 you 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.700
 make sure you have the last 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 and then you start a backup of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.299
 your iphone so here you do well 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.490
 all these steps and then we'll 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.020
 able to start the jailbreak on your 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.310
 computer you are going to need to 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 download the little program that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 is called pangu so it's him who 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.740
 allows the jailbreak and you have a link 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.220
 download in the description of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.049
 the video 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 once you have it you run it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.590
 as an administrator and then 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.329
 that's how they show up on 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.920
 your computer at the moment I'm doing 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.540
 this video you see that everything is in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.439
 Chinese and has not yet been translated into 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 English or French 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.189
 but the most important you will see 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.750
 it's very simple we make sure 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.640
 up that he has detected our device 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.070
 so me you see iphone 5 aces of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.540
 steven here you uncheck this box and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.409
 then here the blue button is the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 jailbreak button 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.619
 you just have one click to do 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 on it to start the jailbreak 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.459
 so that's why language matters 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.959
 we do not care about your iphone you 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.379
 see it you show restore 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.819
 In progress 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.400
 then your life screen 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.659
 black so there's no panic it's all over 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.340
 does normal that your iphone you 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.170
 shows that you see that the bar of 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.090
 progress on pangu well we're going 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.680
 moving forward will progress as you go 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.989
 that the jailbreak procedure is taking place 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.099
 and on your iphone you also see the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.079
 apple apple with a bar of 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.670
 progress on after a while 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.099
 you have the configuration screen which 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.689
 appears here with hello so there is no 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.920
 to touch anything you leave well pangu 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.019
 continue you see that the bar 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.459
 had not yet arrived fully 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.010
 once the bar is filled your 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.659
 iphone restarts again and there 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.379
 you're going to have the screen again 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.120
 configuration 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.379
 from that moment on this time 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.269
 it's good you can unlock 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.859
 your device and do the few 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.750
 small configuration steps that one 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.849
 so here I connect to my network 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.680
 wifi if you want to use touch heidi 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.329
 you can you can also configure 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.650
 a security code now that the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.879
 jailbreak is over you can 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.709
 reactivate your code 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.870
 there you start your iphone is 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.969
 then here we are on the screen 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.379
 home the jailbreak is over you 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.209
 see we now have cydia this 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.799
 small brown icon so the installation 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.269
 cydia is very well must 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.590
 just wait for the loading of 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.980
 sources and packages with this screen 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.930
 black 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.459
 it may take me a few minutes 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.169
 I accelerated it must it 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.479
 finished you can go back on cydia 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.400
 there is then you're done 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.949
 your iphone your ipod touch or your 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.090
 ipad is jailbroken soyal and suite and 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.650
 I remind you that this is a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.239
 untethered type jailbreak 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.709
 if at the moment you do this jailbreak 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.720
 you still have this warning 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.280
 red here it's normal it warns you 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.870
 just that not all cydia tweaks 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 are not compatible with ayo and follows 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.919
 so in any case that's when it was necessary 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.229
 go for jailbreak ios more 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:45.239
 on iphone ipod touch or ipad anywhere 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.979

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.099
