are up and then that goes out over the
here<00:00:42.920> right<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:44.850> one

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
here right there you can see there's one

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
here right there you can see there's one
end<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> blue<00:00:45.870> stripe<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.559> there's<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
end with the blue stripe and there's the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.750 
end with the blue stripe and there's the
other<00:00:47.390> blue<00:00:48.390> stripe<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.079> there

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
other blue stripe right there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.979 
other blue stripe right there
and<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.219> Ethernet<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.750> back

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and it's just an Ethernet it's back

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.920 
and it's just an Ethernet it's back
there<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.879> pretty<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.600> sure<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
there and that's pretty much sure it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.529 
there and that's pretty much sure it
goes<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.030> online<00:01:00.359> Xer<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.140> tascam

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
goes in and that's online Xer a tascam

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.520 
goes in and that's online Xer a tascam
TV<00:01:03.539> 1000<00:01:04.290> something<00:01:05.159> extra<00:01:05.580> cables<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
TV 1000 something extra cables on the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.530 
TV 1000 something extra cables on the
top<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> mixer

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.790 

and<00:01:15.140> then<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:15.560> has<00:01:15.800> to<00:01:15.830> go<00:01:16.160> out<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
and then that has to go out to the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.350 
and then that has to go out to the
computer<00:01:19.600> do<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:20.720> toss<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:20.960> back<00:01:21.320> here<00:01:22.360> back

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
computer do they toss it back here back

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.440 
computer do they toss it back here back
in<00:01:23.630> there<00:01:23.840> with<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> leaves<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.620> see<00:01:24.830> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
in there with the leaves you see the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.640 
in there with the leaves you see the
that<00:01:26.450> black<00:01:26.750> sort<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.440> printer<00:01:28.370> looking<00:01:28.760> plug

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
that black sort of printer looking plug

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.360 
that black sort of printer looking plug
right<00:01:30.650> there<00:01:31.960> that's<00:01:32.960> both<00:01:33.230> coming<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.040> going

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
right there that's both coming and going

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.840 
right there that's both coming and going
it<00:01:34.520> goes<00:01:34.790> both<00:01:35.000> ways<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:36.580> transmit<00:01:37.580> and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
it goes both ways so it's transmit and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.850 
it goes both ways so it's transmit and
receive<00:01:37.940> eight<00:01:38.930> channels<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:40.580> on<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.820> mixer

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
receive eight channels so on the mixer

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.350 
receive eight channels so on the mixer
these<00:01:42.860> first<00:01:43.220> eight<00:01:43.430> channels<00:01:43.850> are<00:01:43.970> going<00:01:44.000> to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
these first eight channels are going to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.570 
these first eight channels are going to
the<00:01:44.510> computer<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.890> really<00:01:46.160> channel

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
the computer and this is really channel

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.780 
the computer and this is really channel
one<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> return<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.920> next<00:01:49.190> eight<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
one on the return the next eight of the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.780 
one on the return the next eight of the
returns<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.540> there's<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:50.810> couple<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.200> sub<00:01:52.190> you

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
returns and there's a couple of sub you

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.480 
returns and there's a couple of sub you
know<00:01:52.850> groups<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.680> final<00:01:55.100> stereo

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
know groups and then the final stereo

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.469 
know groups and then the final stereo
out<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.590> runs<00:01:57.800> out<00:01:58.040> up<00:01:58.220> here<00:02:04.300> there's<00:02:05.300> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
out and that runs out up here there's to

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.760 
out and that runs out up here there's to
the<00:02:05.570> speakers<00:02:06.370> these<00:02:07.370> speakers<00:02:07.760> right<00:02:08.000> here

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770
