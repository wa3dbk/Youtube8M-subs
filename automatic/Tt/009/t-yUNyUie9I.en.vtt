00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
teammates more than maybe we impacted

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.730 
teammates more than maybe we impacted
them<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.210> gave<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> opportunity

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
them and it also gave me the opportunity

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
them and it also gave me the opportunity
to<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:05.070> poverty<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.670> pain<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.540> way<00:02:06.630> that
