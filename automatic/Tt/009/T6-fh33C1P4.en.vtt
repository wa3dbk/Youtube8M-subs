00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.600

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.600
 [Music] 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.640
 friends good night good night 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.290
 sports we are again in the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 billiard capsules and this time 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.570
 we will talk about him 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.970
 in the billiard cloth is an element very 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.130
 delicate is an element that we 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.650
 we must take very much into account because 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.329
 the day tables are perfectly 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.360
 clean should be perfectly 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.640
 clean neat should not see any 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.700
 Hurry in what is the billiard cloth and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.440
 for that there are special attachments like 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.359
 vacuum brushes that all this 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.699
 The pool billiard shop is a 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.440
 shop specializing in articles of 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.530
 billiards and all implants 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 as well 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.649
 is this villa cloth 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.450
 at a table that, as you know, is 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.900
 a table the lead is a large table 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.210
 quality 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.490
 the cloth components that are not always 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.510
 the cloth is used to erase first 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.820
 the bands and then the bed of what 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.820
 properly the table the bands must 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.730
 You go a cloth - lined but must 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.770
 go perfectly stretched and repainted 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.540
 in such a way that there is not one 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.860
 bubble that we can load the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.650
 cloth 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.350
 adhered to what the band is like 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.990
 also on the part of the stone 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.610
 stretch the cloth very hard to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.920
 that there is no wrinkle left and when 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.850
 we put our hands on it is not 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 form waves in what is bread nobody 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.250
 well this year is composed 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.810
 a wool fabric 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.730
 of silk and nylon that our 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 components come out 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.920
 is burned and shaved to the wool to 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 do not have lumps 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 to be noticed above the cloth and the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.590
 ball can run perfectly and roll 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 quite as you can see it 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.290
 in this moment the ball 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.330
 keeps rolling until it takes friction in 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.460
 the cloth and then you can run towards 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
 certain place that we send the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.380
 hit but the important thing about this is that 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.390
 when we hit the ball run 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.760
 perfectly on the surface of the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.130
 cloth we do not have any distrust in 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.890
 that the ball is going to divert towards some 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.600
 place or towards another since the plot the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.030
 warp of bread is perfectly 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.700
 consistent and that makes the ball run 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.520
 as we want well there are several 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.890
 colors is used a lot for the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.530
 television is light green or blue 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.120
 also in most of the villages and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.300
 The cloth has traditionally been used 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.550
 green but in the tournaments a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.740
 blue cloth is a blue cloth that serves to 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.380
 television 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.390
 or a light green cloth like this too 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 which also serves the same purposes 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.860
 there are other very dark espanyol and what 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.770
 people know how a normal cloth is 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.069
 a very thick cloth a wool cloth very 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.920
 thick that was formerly used 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.599
 the free carom was much slower and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.209
 the ball did not have this route that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.549
 Now I know the truth is that it's a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.850
 face play with this type of fabrics 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.980
 all right 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.400
 also this Spanish is manufactured 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.420
 basically in spain and belgium these 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.420
 cloths arrive from there 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.370
 specialized sculpture shops 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 of glasses 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.330
 now this cloth as it tastes good 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 let's try for you to see with 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.440
 a fantasy carom 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.250
 on the way 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.569
 you have to hit the ball with great force 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.670
 hitting the yellow ball 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.329
 small jumps without touching the red ball 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.450
 taking short band band short band 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.609
 and carambola to see if it comes out like you 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.390
 you know in the fantasy carom are given 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.010
 three opportunities for each play 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:20.269
 let's see if it 's high 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:20.269
 [Music]
