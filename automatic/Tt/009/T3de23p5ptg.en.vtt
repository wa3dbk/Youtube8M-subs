number 12 has control so there's a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380

important thing to remember is that any

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
important thing to remember is that any
time<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> referee<00:01:14.040> blows<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.310> whistle<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.210> stop

the<00:01:15.780> shot<00:01:15.990> clock<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.400> same<00:01:17.640> team<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the shot clock if the same team is to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
the shot clock if the same team is to
get<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> ball<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.830> shot<00:01:20.009> clock<00:01:20.220> will

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
get the ball then the shot clock will

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539 
get the ball then the shot clock will
not<00:01:20.549> reset<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> first<00:01:22.320> example<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
not reset the first example is when the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
not reset the first example is when the
defense<00:01:23.729> knocks<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> hill

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
defense knocks it out here it's a hill

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
defense knocks it out here it's a hill
ball<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.369> Green<00:01:27.060> gets<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> ball<00:01:27.659> back

ball but Green gets the ball back

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.210 
ball but Green gets the ball back
because<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> possession<00:01:29.430> error

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.649 

here<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.520> an<00:01:35.610> example<00:01:35.909> where<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.240> double

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
here we have an example where a double

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.530 
here we have an example where a double
foul<00:01:36.900> has<00:01:37.170> been<00:01:37.200> called<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> same<00:01:39.119> team<00:01:39.390> will

foul has been called the same team will

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
foul has been called the same team will
get<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> ball<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.220> if<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.640> less<00:01:41.820> than

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
get the ball back if there are less than

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.749 
get the ball back if there are less than
24<00:01:42.360> seconds<00:01:42.990> left<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> shot<00:01:44.460> clock

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
24 seconds left then the shot clock

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.240 
24 seconds left then the shot clock
should<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.060> reset<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> not<00:01:45.840> run<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.680> reset

should be reset and not run you reset

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the shot clock which means it goes back

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.210 
the shot clock which means it goes back
to<00:01:50.369> 24<00:01:50.790> seconds<00:01:51.270> at<00:01:52.049> times<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> referee

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
shot clock that we should look at here

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.520 
shot clock that we should look at here
you<00:03:26.640> see<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> number<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.270> shots<00:03:27.720> being<00:03:28.080> taken

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
you see a number of shots being taken

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.830 
you see a number of shots being taken
that<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.100> ball<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.310> not<00:03:29.520> hitting<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> ring<00:03:30.420> so

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that the ball is not hitting the ring so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.350 
that the ball is not hitting the ring so
the<00:03:30.959> shot<00:03:31.170> clock<00:03:31.380> should<00:03:31.740> not<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.600> reset<00:03:35.360> in

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
the shot clock should not be reset in

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.720 
the shot clock should not be reset in
this<00:03:36.690> example<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.740> shot<00:03:37.980> clock<00:03:38.250> goes<00:03:38.490> off

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
this example the shot clock goes off

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.270 
this example the shot clock goes off
while<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.420> shot<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.230> air<00:03:40.380> however

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
while the shot is in the air however

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.500 
while the shot is in the air however
you'd<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:41.970> hit<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.780> ring<00:03:42.990> so<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.740> play<00:03:44.190> on

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.870 

the<00:03:48.510> clock<00:03:48.959> should<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.560> reset<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:50.190> soon<00:03:50.640> as<00:03:50.760> it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the clock should be reset as soon as it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.770 
the clock should be reset as soon as it
hits<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> ring<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.160> example<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.510> shot

if this occurs simply tell the referee
that<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:07.080> was<00:04:07.200> an<00:04:07.320> error<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.890> they<00:04:08.490> will

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
that there was an error and they will

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.410 
that there was an error and they will
have<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.360> shot<00:04:09.570> clock<00:04:09.780> reset<00:04:10.970> here<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
have the shot clock reset here the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.080 
have the shot clock reset here the
offense<00:04:12.810> shoots<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.920> shot<00:04:14.160> clock<00:04:14.370> expires
