00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.520
 the silence invades me creating their 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.680
 atmospheres studying friendships that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.019
 they make a life prosperous and the 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.570
 search for a balance the destination 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.879
 you will lose good and bad things and so on 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.949
 we will have to see how to open the rooms and 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.230
 plan on this flight a flight with 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.660
 scales in mournful memories between 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.269
 sky and the ground there is a place where 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.339
 I lose myself I want to stop dreaming about being 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.559
 something and start doing it hug my 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.199
 family but I do not dare to do it and not 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.600
 I can understand where this is hidden 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.330
 invisible mental barrier I know you're 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.940
 spiritual an indefinable shit is that 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.430
 despair to be mortal know that today I am 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 and tomorrow maybe he will die for that and himself 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.290
 I give everything I can because the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.060
 beauty is a passing stage for more 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.460
 do not want it from death nobody 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.470
 escapes sooner or later catches you and only 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.120
 bones are left while the system 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.800
 silk and you get tangled up burns your head like that 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.920
 to believe that in money and power 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.440
 is the fortress I do not want to look like a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 analyst I only seek to understand my own 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.870
 point of view I consider myself an idealist 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 without great ideals my rap is an edge 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.330
 from these slums a cursed artist of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 occasional positive thoughts 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.790
 as much collateral damage as snacks 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.650
 to existential crises have become 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.470
 in subversive emitter of lives 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.540
 artificial I follow the signs in each 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.960
 pulsation using channels that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.460
 tune the heart I consider myself 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 responsible for your arrhythmia if your pressure 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.330
 blood increases this tireless 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 expression of each tormenting line 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.830
 that alchemy applied on the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 cyclothymia my biggest wish is that 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 this micro dyes your vineyard while in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.910
 each verse the planets line up in a 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.030
 universe that expands do not ask me to 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.370
 you change if I am where I am or where I have 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 I just want to get carried away by the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.900
 instinct find my place out of this 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 labyrinth that is my body and I paint you 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.780
 something different outside my own space 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 out of me 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.800
 me time and I confess of what I 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.810
 I regret and although I go back to the beginning 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.730
 again and I try and I snuffed it is the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.620
 preface with which satiate the time and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.930
 although today I am prone to feel 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.420
 defenseless equally transparent in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.270
 being is not in a paper something donated 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.430
 is on a lined paper and ringed the 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.980
 lines are alleys where 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.530
 I find my past traced in words 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 entwined a psychologist who always 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.880
 is on duty for a nocturnal being that 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.310
 he feels overwhelmed committed to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.310
 talk about what many have been silent 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.170
 limited by a poetic structure 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.510
 misplaced in a culture of aesthetics 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.820
 of airtight labels and airtight 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.580
 was frantic where the oligarch has 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.620
 let the reaper turns 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.230
 multifaceted ethics responds to a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.810
 pathetic and erratic idea that hides 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.720
 racism but on the horizon we all 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.060
 we find the same thing for me life 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.340
 a mechanism is summarized in texts in 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.769
 that countered your elitism today migo 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.110
 centrism is a weak feeling this 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.850
 division and even then I feel like 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.220
 write and celebrate that we are 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.860
 for living let open a new April before 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.920
 the routine rush novel that reveals a 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.410
 common civilization of imaginary worlds between 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.320
 a parallel life and hostile my mind 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.700
 flies towards instants instants but at 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.500
 otherwise the truth is not so 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.720
 interesting challenging 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.570
 challenges me to move forward through 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.540
 this sidewalk so strange so 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.940
 I free myself from the herd but is this what 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.670
 I want or everything is a hoax I'm still 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.430
 that outsider looking for that answer and in 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.670
 middle of the crowd is considered a 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 hermit 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 we go 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.550
 I just want to get carried away by the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.560
 instinct find my place out of this 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.420
 labyrinth that is your body and I paint you 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.970
 something different outside my own space 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.829
 out of my own time and I confess of 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.690
 what I regret and although I go back to 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.610
 I start again and I try and 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.140
 while you see the preface with which 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.360
 came out on time and even though today 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
 prone to feeling helpless 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.260
 equally transparent alike while 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.260
 40 equal while the wind 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 do not
