 since i do you found 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:54.560
 taste 2 that is technically correct 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:03:04.360
 collector so there it is 10 9 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:08.810
 eight seven six five four three two 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:15.069
 ace in some way when you card in 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.120

 ten nine eight seven six five 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 four three two so here we put them in 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.690
 deck this deck 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.360
 under our carpet of cards the main thing in this focus 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.780
 so that the viewer does not see that back down 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.580
 someone such here is our own card for a long time 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.970
 the viewer can choose any card from 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.670
 not remove a card say 3 4 3 2 to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.190
 worms he chose the owner upstairs claude 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.130
 and and do not take so much cards without 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.510
 how much difference and cover it he did 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.440
 a couple of such fights 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:02.019
 without glare without esophagus that 40 units 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:05.980
 while just like that just wanted 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.980
 go to taste 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:22.109
 let's do it there we do it so that 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.630
 bottom cards to some of ours were 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.930
 a picture which i just laid out from 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.660
 car wash up to ten or let's say if you 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.660
 so the troika had a lot and constantly 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:42.590
 I hope silk is only now learning 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.590
 the first second third card is ours 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.350
 three if you get five yiri 4 or 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:54.790
 eight there have fallen five 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.280
 our map was 5 like this 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.190
 so that the ace doesn't fall too 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.810
 if they take the cat our card is 8 like this 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.700
 Well, in general, here is such a card trick 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.770
