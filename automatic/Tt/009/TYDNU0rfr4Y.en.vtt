 started well from the Santa Catarina school 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.120
 prejudice is something that is present 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 in our everyday life and how 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960
 You deal with this. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220
 whenever we realize that the other 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.560
 is doing something he can 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.479
 to think that it's not so bad, the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.910
 another is hurting us look at 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.590
 limit is hurt you may not notice not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.270
 is affecting another tone almost always 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.310
 encourages people to talk and realize 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.440
 and warn colleagues that the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 ear when the colleague is sometimes not 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.239
 realizing but is causing the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.250
 prejudice without even realizing that we 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.060
 we believe that we have a greater being 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.770
 how many god do people believe is us 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 We seek aid it to also help 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.520
 method to help us live longer. 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.959
 deep into the mission that we 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 we only received here on earth 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.130
 I've been here at school eight years and I 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.010
 I have a few more years here and 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.310
 Sometimes I look back and think everything 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.739
 I spent here I see that everything was worth the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.769
 pity and all moments were positive 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.980
 and made me who I am now and the 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.690
 My friends, the friendships I made here. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.380
 they also go to life like this 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.410
 Like the memories I made here I came 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.050
 forth under the influence of it and we are
