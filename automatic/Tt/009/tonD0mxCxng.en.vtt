00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello my dear, today I have one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.140
 very special video for you and indeed 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.120
 design via iphone case itself 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.500
 with the simplest means this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 beautiful things have come out 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.860
 and it's super easy and that will be 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.690
 I show you today like it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.690
 So it works so much fun 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.640
 First, we need a kata 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.960
 then we need a good one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.610
 katar a good paper scissors one 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.970
 thin pencil because I have here 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.890
 the k pin then taken a piece 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.050
 carton you like to share a template 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 want to do 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 and of course your iphone case or the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.890
 Cover your cellphone, so to speak, use thieves 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.770
 then we still need repkin 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.750
 have papers and pattern of your choice what 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.260
 she had what she would like to use 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.610
 I picked these few 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.020
 my tip is always if you will 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.380
 or aldi times every now and then looks 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 have such papers then offer and there 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.079
 you have several different ones 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.830
 Colors and you can always 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.330
 very good tinker 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.070
 the first thing we have to do is sign 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.259
 For this, take the phone left on the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 Paper and draw with the pencil 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.100
 careful around it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.149
 take your time because of it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 It can happen that we are there a bit 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.710
 slipped away and that is not the case 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 so for the first time it worked quite calmly 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.720
 and cozy just stupid around 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.720
 to draw 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.570
 next we have to do it completely 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.000
 cut out well there you can 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.890
 take your time with it 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.219
 and finally it will be really nice 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.219
 looks 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.690
 Of course we can test if that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.070
 Already in the hall I fit 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.320
 think it looks very good 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490
 and the last thing we need now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 is that we have this little window 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.290
 have to leave the top and do that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.640
 we now 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.410
 Now we hold the paper very close 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.959
 the cover and draw once very tight 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.220
 on edge once around it so that we 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.580
 know where the window is the same 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.130
 now we need that cut out 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.680
 just on cards and that 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.989
 We should be very careful and with 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.090
 then make it right 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.090
 Nice in the precise and so is finished 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.569
 eventual loan city borders you can 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.459
 quite simply with an eraser 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.569
 just erase away that you 're the one 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.569
 paper not linked 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.700
 I think she has become really nice 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.469
 and it is something different than always 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.390
 These standard cases everyone has 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.219
 you can do so much of your own with it 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.140
 make and change anytime if 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.790
 you are after that and now I show you 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.379
 a few more tips about everything else 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.530
 could do with a template 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.439
 eg also super rulers own creative 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.200
 choose motives, for example 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:14.450
 Draw silver mangas or what you like 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.459
 may just draw when you draw 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.290
 I can not do you that good 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.639
 In any case, personal pictures 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.099
 I recommend here for example 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.680
 which of my cat chose or from 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.069
 My stuff the last holiday too 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 something and really great ideas and if 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.400
 you can not draw but you want 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.639
 also not your mangas to cut it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.439
 These simple clips are always free 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.000
 in every magazines dealer 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.689
 and there could be, for example, too 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.139
 wonderful any rural manger 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.139
 choose motives 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.269
 that could look like that 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.860
 that was it with the whole 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.930
 simple do it yourself i hope you 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.910
 have fun on the video have beautiful new 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.900
 learned things he can do I 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.310
 I can not feel right now 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
 decide what I call the first a 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.489
 want to make mobile phone and if you like something 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.590
 you do not like then of course you can 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.390
 I still draw things myself 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.040
 have these motives synonymous only 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.840
 So signed off if you are not yourself 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.430
 Of course, you can also do something with techniques 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.989
 take breaks or you just take off 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.419
 your manga or a magazine 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.489
 a favorite motif what you think are good 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.900
 should the paper but thin 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.790
 Of course you can do it 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.160
 laminate or you can do something behind 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.750
 give like a solid cardboard but I think 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.490
 For example, that's not necessary because 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.320
 the cover protects the whole thing 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.669
 especially good liked the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.560
 Personal things so become to 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.060
 example, have pets or any 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.500
 photo of your loved ones or the last one 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.750
 Holiday I think that's also true 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.430
 to make beautiful idea and to stage it 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.900
 is super easy as something expensive 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.340
 to have printed on somehow I have 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.500
 my sister, for example, once with 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.150
 given to your horse because I am at 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.650
 I had a lot of fun crafting 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.460
 I want such a cover for you 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.930
 giving away 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.880
