of need what can soccer coaches and

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.810 
of need what can soccer coaches and
strength<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:33.320> conditioning<00:00:33.860> coaches<00:00:34.129> take

strength and conditioning coaches take

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.600 
strength and conditioning coaches take
from<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.210> book<00:00:35.390> DVD<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:36.770> think<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.340> soccer

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
from the book DVD I think the soccer

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.750 
from the book DVD I think the soccer
coaches<00:00:38.090> can<00:00:38.239> gain<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.829> lot<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:39.950> information<00:00:40.520> on

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
coaches can gain a lot of information on

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.940 
coaches can gain a lot of information on
how<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.420> put<00:00:41.810> together<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.140> process<00:00:42.739> of<00:00:42.860> a

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
how to put together the process of a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.500 
how to put together the process of a
strength<00:00:43.190> conditioning<00:00:43.370> program<00:00:44.030> for<00:00:44.270> soccer

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
strength conditioning program for soccer

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.569 
strength conditioning program for soccer
players<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.170> lot<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.770> times<00:00:46.010> there's<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.550> of

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
players a lot of times there's a lot of

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.760 
players a lot of times there's a lot of
drills<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.390> exercises<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.470> are<00:00:48.530> out<00:00:48.739> there

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
drills and exercises that are out there

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.620 
drills and exercises that are out there
that<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.220> might<00:00:49.399> use<00:00:49.730> but<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.149> may<00:00:50.270> not<00:00:50.390> be<00:00:50.450> in

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
that they might use but it may not be in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.660 
that they might use but it may not be in
the<00:00:50.719> right<00:00:50.870> context<00:00:51.469> for<00:00:51.590> soccer<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.550> I'm

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
the right context for soccer so I'm

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.549 
the right context for soccer so I'm
hoping<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.090> they<00:00:53.239> can<00:00:53.270> develop<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.960> good

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
hoping that they can develop a good

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.530 
hoping that they can develop a good
quality<00:00:54.980> program<00:00:55.430> from<00:00:55.640> beginning<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.510> end

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
quality program from beginning to end

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.660 
quality program from beginning to end
that<00:00:57.079> will<00:00:57.230> be<00:00:57.350> used<00:00:57.590> as<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:57.860> beginning<00:00:58.250> athlete

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
that will be used as a beginning athlete

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.979 
that will be used as a beginning athlete
all<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.000> up<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.149> an<00:00:59.390> advanced<00:00:59.840> level

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
all the way up to an advanced level

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.010 
all the way up to an advanced level
athlete<00:01:01.300> what<00:01:02.300> types<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.719> training

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
athlete what types of training

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.259 
athlete what types of training
activities<00:01:03.800> do<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.189> emphasize<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:05.119> the

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
activities do you emphasize in the

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.950 
activities do you emphasize in the
offseason<00:01:06.520> during<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.579> offseason<00:01:07.759> if<00:01:08.299> we<00:01:08.810> can

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
offseason during the offseason if we can

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.530 
offseason during the offseason if we can
find<00:01:09.170> enough<00:01:09.500> time<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.010> be<00:01:10.420> consistent<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.450> a

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
find enough time to be consistent with a

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.210 
find enough time to be consistent with a
training<00:01:12.020> I'd<00:01:12.110> like<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.890> know<00:01:12.950> really

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
training I'd like to you know really

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.039 
training I'd like to you know really
concentrate<00:01:13.909> on<00:01:13.940> strength<00:01:14.450> development<00:01:14.720> for

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
concentrate on strength development for

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.060 
concentrate on strength development for
athletes<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.619> think<00:01:15.680> that's<00:01:15.950> a

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
athletes because I think that's a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.620 
athletes because I think that's a
missing<00:01:16.430> link<00:01:16.670> with<00:01:16.880> a<00:01:16.909> lot<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.390> soccer

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
missing link with a lot of soccer

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.170 
missing link with a lot of soccer
players<00:01:17.990> especially<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.799> I<00:01:19.460> think<00:01:19.729> if<00:01:20.030> they

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
players especially and I think if they

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.510 
players especially and I think if they
can<00:01:20.330> find<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.689> good<00:01:21.049> four<00:01:21.799> five<00:01:22.040> six<00:01:22.280> week

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
can find a good four five six week

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.010 
can find a good four five six week
period<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:23.210> can<00:01:23.360> develop<00:01:23.720> their

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
period that they can develop their

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080 
period that they can develop their
strength<00:01:24.409> total<00:01:24.979> body<00:01:25.130> strength<00:01:25.610> it's

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
strength total body strength it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.920 
strength total body strength it's
definitely<00:01:26.330> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.689> help<00:01:26.750> their

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
definitely going to help their

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.109 
definitely going to help their
performance<00:01:27.470> down<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.740> road<00:01:27.950> how<00:01:28.700> does<00:01:28.939> a

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
performance down the road how does a

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.330 
performance down the road how does a
conditioning<00:01:29.780> program<00:01:30.200> for<00:01:30.530> female<00:01:31.010> soccer

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
conditioning program for female soccer

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.149 
conditioning program for female soccer
players<00:01:31.760> differ<00:01:32.689> from<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.200> program<00:01:33.710> for<00:01:33.979> male

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
players differ from a program for male

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.230 
players differ from a program for male
players<00:01:36.009> female<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.340> male<00:01:37.610> conditioning

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
players female and male conditioning

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.249 
players female and male conditioning
program<00:01:38.570> going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.840> different<00:01:39.110> in<00:01:39.229> that

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
program going to different in that

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.980 
program going to different in that
females<00:01:39.950> tend<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.640> have<00:01:40.790> less<00:01:41.270> total<00:01:41.720> body

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
females tend to have less total body

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.600 
females tend to have less total body
strength<00:01:42.439> than<00:01:42.619> males<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.189> think<00:01:43.460> that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
strength than males and I think that

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.880 
strength than males and I think that
needs<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.939> be<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.210> big<00:01:44.780> emphasis<00:01:45.259> for<00:01:45.470> females

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
needs to be the big emphasis for females

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.130 
needs to be the big emphasis for females
is<00:01:46.070> especially<00:01:47.000> upper<00:01:47.240> body<00:01:47.450> strength<00:01:47.780> and

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
is especially upper body strength and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.350 
is especially upper body strength and
keeping<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.009> progressed<00:01:49.850> through<00:01:50.180> their

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
keeping that progressed through their

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.700 
keeping that progressed through their
training<00:01:50.750> cycles<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.350> through<00:01:51.590> their

develop on the field and use that

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.899 
develop on the field and use that
strength<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.840> know<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.470> their<00:01:57.650> game<00:01:57.909> and

develop that type of strength to use on

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.280 
develop that type of strength to use on
a<00:02:03.829> field<00:02:04.299> how<00:02:05.299> can<00:02:05.509> coaches<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.140> trainers

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
a field how can coaches and trainers

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.919 
a field how can coaches and trainers
help<00:02:06.829> avoid<00:02:07.130> burnout<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.909> over<00:02:08.329> training<00:02:08.599> in

help avoid burnout and over training in

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.009 
help avoid burnout and over training in
players<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.700> think<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.269> kids<00:02:11.480> tend<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> get

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
players I think the kids tend to get

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.809 
players I think the kids tend to get
pushed<00:02:12.530> very<00:02:12.950> hard<00:02:13.219> at<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.519> younger<00:02:13.730> age

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
pushed very hard at a younger age

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.630 
pushed very hard at a younger age
nowadays<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:14.989> think<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
nowadays and I think the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.370 
nowadays and I think the
the<00:02:17.640> coaches<00:02:17.910> should<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.630> keep<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.230> in

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the coaches should you know keep that in

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650 
the coaches should you know keep that in
mind<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.830> they're<00:02:20.010> still<00:02:20.400> developing<00:02:20.940> young

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
mind that they're still developing young

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.480 
mind that they're still developing young
athletes<00:02:22.200> especially<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.680> younger<00:02:22.860> kids<00:02:23.069> and

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
athletes especially the younger kids and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.670 
athletes especially the younger kids and
I<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.880> they<00:02:23.970> need<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.150> progress<00:02:24.600> some<00:02:25.440> type

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
I think they need to progress some type

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.559 
I think they need to progress some type
of<00:02:25.709> physical<00:02:26.520> development<00:02:27.000> within<00:02:27.360> their

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of physical development within their

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.270 
of physical development within their
training<00:02:27.930> cycles<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.500> training<00:02:28.860> process

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
training cycles and training process

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.010 
training cycles and training process
it's<00:02:29.459> tougher<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.360> there's<00:02:30.540> double

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
it's tougher now because there's double

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
it's tougher now because there's double
and<00:02:31.260> dual<00:02:31.560> seasons<00:02:32.100> all<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> time<00:02:32.550> where

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and dual seasons all the time where

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.360 
and dual seasons all the time where
they're<00:02:32.880> done<00:02:33.060> spending<00:02:33.930> enough<00:02:34.230> time

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
they're done spending enough time

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
they're done spending enough time
developing<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> athletic<00:02:36.050> qualities<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
developing the athletic qualities but I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.199 
developing the athletic qualities but I
think<00:02:37.650> if<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.010> find<00:02:38.310> some<00:02:38.550> periods<00:02:39.060> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
think if they can find some periods of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.720 
think if they can find some periods of
time<00:02:39.480> during<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.470> year<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.830> develop<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.310> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
time during a year to develop that that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.580 
time during a year to develop that that
type<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> athleticism<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> help

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
type of athleticism it's going to help

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.380 
type of athleticism it's going to help
carry<00:02:43.920> over<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.400> keep<00:02:44.640> injuries<00:02:45.030> down<00:02:45.209> as

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
carry over and keep injuries down as

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
carry over and keep injuries down as
well
