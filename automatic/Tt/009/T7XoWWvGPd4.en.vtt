00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.180
In this video, I'd like to tell you a little bit 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.780
about Superpowers, the HTML5 game maker.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.360
Superpowers is built with Web technologies.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.070
It has a very small core
that serves your projects

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.880
and lets you collaborate in real-time.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.560
All editors and features are plugins, built
on top of that small core.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.460
You can work over the Internet with anyone.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.499
All they need is your project's address and password.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
But you don't need an Internet connection
to use Superpowers on your own.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.499
Superpowers runs practically everywhere,
just like the Web.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.799
Your games can be exported to run on most
desktop and mobile operating systems.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Superpowers comes with various importers.
You can easily import 2D sprites

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.550
as well as 3D models.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.410
In Superpowers, your game logic 
is powered by TypeScript,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.370
a superset of JavaScript.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.290
TypeScript provides optional typing,
when you need it.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.010
And it stays out of your way
the rest of the time.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.140
In a Superpowers game, you are the director.
You command actors to come on stage,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.510
you tell them which costumes to wear
and how they should behave.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.620
A minimal game requires two actors
One wearing a costume

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.670
And one with a camera.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.640
We can write all of this down in a script,
but it's cumbersome.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.530
We can use a scene asset to replace
all this code with a visual construction.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.040
A single line of code will then allow us
to make all of our actors come on stage.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.960
Behaviors let us define parts for our actors.
The awake() function is called once

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.860
when the actor is created.
The update() function is called

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.180
sixty times a second.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.380
Once a behavior has been defined,
it can be attached to one or more actors.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
Superpowers plugins can expose
existing JavaScript libraries.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.109
You can easily make your own, too,
and leverage the big JavaScript ecosystem.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.960
I hope you enjoyed this short
introduction to Superpowers.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.220
Superpowers is currently in early access.
We plan to open source it in a few months.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.410
By supporting our crowdfunding campaign now,
you'll get instant access to Superpowers

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.710
as well as its source code.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.840
You can learn more, and support
Superpowers's development

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.840
I guess that's it, so, thanks for watching!
