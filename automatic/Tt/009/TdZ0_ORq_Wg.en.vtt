this is our green screen so this is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.580 
this is our green screen so this is
where<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.180> shoot<00:02:11.330> fast<00:02:11.600> as<00:02:11.780> possible<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.410> used

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
where we shoot fast as possible it used

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.950 
where we shoot fast as possible it used
to<00:02:12.740> be<00:02:12.860> on<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> self<00:02:13.670> constructed<00:02:14.360> white

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
wall that I built in my garage but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280 
wall that I built in my garage but
become<00:02:16.910> an<00:02:17.030> actual<00:02:17.540> change<00:02:17.690> game<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.110> much

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
become an actual change game is much

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.770

more<00:02:18.320> effective<00:02:19.010> these<00:02:19.670> lights<00:02:19.970> are<00:02:20.209> our<00:02:20.540> old

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
more effective these lights are our old

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.330 
more effective these lights are our old
lights<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.890> used<00:02:22.130> them<00:02:22.310> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
lights so we just used them to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
lights so we just used them to
illuminate<00:02:22.760> green<00:02:22.790> screen<00:02:23.390> they<00:02:23.510> actually

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
illuminate green screen they actually

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.560 
illuminate green screen they actually
have<00:02:24.020> these<00:02:24.170> type<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.980> janky<00:02:25.940> plastic

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
have these type up is like janky plastic

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.050 
have these type up is like janky plastic
color<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.740> whatever<00:02:28.100> they're<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.520> their<00:02:28.670> blood

janky<00:02:29.510> plastic<00:02:29.930> color<00:02:30.110> changer<00:02:30.560> things<00:02:30.830> in

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
janky plastic color changer things in

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.949 
janky plastic color changer things in
there<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.459> want<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.300> new<00:02:32.480> lights<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.900> I

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
there I want to get new lights and I

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.720 
there I want to get new lights and I
want<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> ceiling<00:02:33.740> mounted<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
want to have the ceiling mounted so the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.550 
want to have the ceiling mounted so the
idea<00:02:35.030> will<00:02:35.209> be<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.840> wire<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.200> law<00:02:36.320> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
idea will be that you wire the law to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.860 
idea will be that you wire the law to
one<00:02:36.739> switch<00:02:37.070> just<00:02:37.370> kind<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.670> go<00:02:37.820> boom<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.780> then

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
one switch just kind of go boom and then

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.390 
one switch just kind of go boom and then
we're<00:02:38.989> ready<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.230> shoot<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.530> fast<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:39.920> possible

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
we're ready to shoot as fast as possible

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.090 
we're ready to shoot as fast as possible
because<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:41.540> amount<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.050> time<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:42.860> waste

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
because the amount of time that we waste

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.010 
because the amount of time that we waste
thinking<00:02:43.670> around<00:02:43.880> with<00:02:44.360> getting<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.840> lights

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
thinking around with getting the lights

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.870 
thinking around with getting the lights
positioned<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:45.950> fixing<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.790> in

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
positioned and then fixing it in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880 
positioned and then fixing it in
post-production<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:48.170> not<00:02:48.410> worth<00:02:48.680> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
post-production is just not worth it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.560 
post-production is just not worth it
here's<00:02:49.610> where<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.880> storm<00:02:50.120> trooper<00:02:50.390> lives

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
here's where the storm trooper lives

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.030 
here's where the storm trooper lives
