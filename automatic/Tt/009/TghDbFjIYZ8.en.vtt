my<00:02:31.710> father<00:02:32.720> said<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> were<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.200> study<00:02:34.410> no

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
my father said you were here to study no

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.250 
my father said you were here to study no
time<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.610> fun<00:02:36.210> stuff<00:02:36.240> no<00:02:36.810> sororities

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
time to do the fun stuff no sororities

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.390 
time to do the fun stuff no sororities
or<00:02:37.380> whatever<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.830> I've<00:02:37.920> been<00:02:38.040> actually

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
or whatever so I've been actually

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.030 
or whatever so I've been actually
wanting<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:39.870> be<00:02:39.960> part<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.320> gamma

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
wanting to do and then be part of gamma

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.540 
wanting to do and then be part of gamma
five<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.790> many<00:02:42.150> many<00:02:42.360> years<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> got

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
five for many many years and so I got

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.400 
five for many many years and so I got
involved<00:02:44.790> recently<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:45.600> both<00:02:45.810> my<00:02:45.990> daughters

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
involved recently when both my daughters

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.280 
involved recently when both my daughters
were<00:02:46.970> social<00:02:47.970> chairs<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.570> their<00:02:48.750> respected

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
were social chairs and their respected

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.100 
were social chairs and their respected
years<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.790> kind<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.090> realized<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.080> I

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
years and just kind of realized that I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.020 
years and just kind of realized that I
can<00:02:52.350> be<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:53.310> member<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.540> well<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.320> me<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
can be a member as well so to me the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.670 
can be a member as well so to me the
strength<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.300> being<00:02:57.540> engaged<00:02:58.350> with<00:02:58.530> my

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
strength and being engaged with my

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.140 
strength and being engaged with my
daughters<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.040> involved<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.790> something

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
daughters and involved and something

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.500 
daughters and involved and something
that<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.300> wanted<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.620> long<00:03:01.920> has<00:03:02.160> been

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that I wanted to do for so long has been

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.180 
that I wanted to do for so long has been
pretty<00:03:03.510> special<00:03:03.960> gamma<00:03:04.470> phi<00:03:04.680> beta<00:03:04.710> has<00:03:05.010> really

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
pretty special gamma phi beta has really

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.340 
pretty special gamma phi beta has really
been<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.580> rock<00:03:05.850> for<00:03:05.880> me<00:03:06.150> personally<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:07.050> think

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
been a rock for me personally I think

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.040 
been a rock for me personally I think
it's<00:03:07.590> strengthened<00:03:08.220> me<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.790> everything<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.990> do

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
it's strengthened me and everything I do

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.550 
it's strengthened me and everything I do

dirty graduated but I thought that was

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.960 
dirty graduated but I thought that was
just<00:03:39.090> such<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.360> special<00:03:39.630> moment<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:41.820> could

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
just such a special moment that we could

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.970 
just such a special moment that we could
go<00:03:42.210> together<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.780> spring<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.740> into

go together and spring you into
something<00:03:44.370> that's<00:03:44.460> so<00:03:45.270> important<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.690> us

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
something that's so important to us

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160 
something that's so important to us
gamma<00:03:47.160> phi<00:03:47.400> beta<00:03:47.430> has<00:03:47.910> been<00:03:48.120> my<00:03:48.270> rock<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.780> so
