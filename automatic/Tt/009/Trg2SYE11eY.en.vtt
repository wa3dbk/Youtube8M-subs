so<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:00.960> my<00:00:01.110> usual<00:00:01.740> thing<00:00:02.010> where<00:00:02.250> I

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
so this is my usual thing where I

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.120 
so this is my usual thing where I
compare<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.380> lengths<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> physical

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
compare the lengths and physical

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.099 
compare the lengths and physical
characteristics<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.180> bunch<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.540> graphics

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
GF 110 card it is so it's sli on a card

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.240 
GF 110 card it is so it's sli on a card
we've<00:00:21.029> seen<00:00:21.270> dual<00:00:21.480> GPU<00:00:21.960> cards<00:00:22.350> quite<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> few

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we've seen dual GPU cards quite a few

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.759 
we've seen dual GPU cards quite a few
times<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> past<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.930> these<00:00:25.439> are

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
times in the past now now these are

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.740

fully featured GF 1 times these are
exactly<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> same<00:00:28.529> GPUs<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> find<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
exactly the same GPUs that you find on a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.160 
exactly the same GPUs that you find on a
gtx<00:00:31.320> 580<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> these<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.690> might<00:00:33.960> ask

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
gtx 580 so one of these so you might ask

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590

well<00:00:34.860> habit<00:00:35.219> Nvidia<00:00:35.579> managed<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> put<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.570> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
well habit Nvidia managed to put two of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.840 
well habit Nvidia managed to put two of
those<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.290> card<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> answer<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
those on one card and the answer is that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.420 
those on one card and the answer is that
they<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:40.469> clocked<00:00:41.010> well

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
they are actually down clocked well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.770 
they are actually down clocked well
first<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.790> all<00:00:41.850> they're<00:00:42.090> binned<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
first of all they're binned very

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.080 
first of all they're binned very
carefully<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> best<00:00:43.920> possible<00:00:44.309> graphics

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
carefully for the best possible graphics

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
carefully for the best possible graphics
cards<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> chips<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.649> put<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
cards are the chips to put on it and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
cards are the chips to put on it and
then<00:00:47.850> second<00:00:48.329> they<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:48.750> down

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
then second they are actually down

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.760 
then second they are actually down
clocked<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.600> less<00:00:52.110> performance

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
clocked so they do have less performance

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.240 
clocked so they do have less performance
than<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.370> single<00:00:53.640> gtx<00:00:54.210> 580<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.770> more<00:00:56.100> than

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
than a single gtx 580 but they more than

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
than a single gtx 580 but they more than
make<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.940> by<00:00:57.149> having<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.559> ok

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
make up for it by having two of them ok

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
make up for it by having two of them ok
so<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> video<00:01:00.090> card<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.660> an<00:01:00.870> 80<00:01:01.079> millimeter

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so this video card has an 80 millimeter

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.160 
so this video card has an 80 millimeter
fan<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> middle<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.520> has<00:01:02.940> heat<00:01:03.629> sinks<00:01:03.989> on

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
fan in the middle it has heat sinks on

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.330 
fan in the middle it has heat sinks on
either<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.880> each<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.689> GPUs<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.740> has

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
either side for each of the GPUs it has

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
either side for each of the GPUs it has
three<00:01:08.939> DVI<00:01:09.330> outputs<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.530> mini

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
three DVI outputs with one mini

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
three DVI outputs with one mini
DisplayPort<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> those<00:01:12.450> three<00:01:12.689> DVI<00:01:13.080> outputs

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
DisplayPort so those three DVI outputs

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
DisplayPort so those three DVI outputs
this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> another<00:01:14.189> unique<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this is another unique thing about this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630 
this is another unique thing about this
card<00:01:15.420> allow<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> support<00:01:16.770> 3d<00:01:17.280> vision

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
card allow it to support 3d vision

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.450 
card allow it to support 3d vision
surround<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.470> plain<00:01:19.740> surround<00:01:20.220> off<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
surround or just plain surround off a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
surround or just plain surround off a
single<00:01:20.790> card<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.390> 3d<00:01:21.810> displays<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.650> DVI

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
single card that is 3d displays over DVI

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
single card that is 3d displays over DVI
so<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.150> cool<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.540> does<00:01:24.720> support

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so that's pretty cool it does support

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
so that's pretty cool it does support
quad<00:01:25.409> sli<00:01:25.729> because<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.270> SLI<00:01:27.689> finger

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
quad sli because it has one SLI finger

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.149 
quad sli because it has one SLI finger
and<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.880> needs<00:01:30.210> two<00:01:30.600> PCIe<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.439> pin<00:01:31.920> power

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and it needs two PCIe a pin power

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.390 
and it needs two PCIe a pin power
connector<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:34.070> contrast<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
connector so let's just contrast it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
connector so let's just contrast it
against<00:01:35.909> these<00:01:36.150> other<00:01:36.360> cards<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> terms<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
against these other cards in terms of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.859 
against these other cards in terms of
length<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.670> 11<00:01:39.090> inch<00:01:39.240> card<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.780> I'll

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
length it is an 11 inch card so I'll

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.310 
length it is an 11 inch card so I'll
just<00:01:39.960> show<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.229> guys<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:42.079> there<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> go

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
just show you guys that there you go

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
just show you guys that there you go
it's<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:43.799> 11<00:01:44.189> inch<00:01:44.340> cart<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> compare<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it's an 11 inch cart so you compare that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.950 
it's an 11 inch cart so you compare that
to<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.470> radeon<00:01:46.890> HD<00:01:47.180> 6990<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740 
going to wreck my tablecloth here the 69
70<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.439> almost<00:02:05.009> 11<00:02:05.520> inches<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.719> go

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
70 is almost 11 inches and then if we go

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.059 
70 is almost 11 inches and then if we go
all<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> way<00:02:07.110> down<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
all the way down into kind of the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
all the way down into kind of the
mainstream<00:02:08.580> cards<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.539> end<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
mainstream cards then we end up with a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.710 
mainstream cards then we end up with a
gtx<00:02:10.679> 560ti<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

nine<00:02:13.080> inch<00:02:13.320> card<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:14.790> contrast<00:02:15.330> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
nine inch card so just for contrast you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.810 
nine inch card so just for contrast you
can<00:02:15.930> look<00:02:16.110> at<00:02:16.320> what<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:16.830> take<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.100> fit<00:02:17.580> a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.630 
gtx 590 in your case versus a gtx 560ti
to<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> mainstream<00:02:24.630> single<00:02:25.380> GPU<00:02:25.770> card<00:02:26.100> now

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
to the mainstream single GPU card now

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 
to the mainstream single GPU card now
there<00:02:26.820> are<00:02:26.850> other<00:02:27.030> considerations<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:28.050> bear

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
there are other considerations to bear

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
there are other considerations to bear
in<00:02:28.350> mind<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.770> well<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.820> van<00:02:30.120> needs<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
in mind as well this van needs to have a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.630 
in mind as well this van needs to have a
fair<00:02:31.470> amount<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.830> clearance<00:02:32.100> around<00:02:32.340> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
fair amount of clearance around it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
fair amount of clearance around it
because<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:33.180> two<00:02:33.600> Fermi's<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.350> there

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
because with two Fermi's in there

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.230 
because with two Fermi's in there
there's<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.310> fair<00:02:35.670> bit<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.910> heat<00:02:36.060> being

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
there's a fair bit of heat being

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.700 
there's a fair bit of heat being
generated<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.050> need<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> make<00:02:37.410> sure<00:02:37.470> it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
generated so you need to make sure it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.420 
generated so you need to make sure it
has<00:02:37.860> adequate<00:02:38.370> ventilation<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:40.310> yeah<00:02:41.310> that's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
has adequate ventilation and yeah that's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
has adequate ventilation and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:41.640> much<00:02:41.760> where<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.570> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
pretty much where I was going with that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.390 
pretty much where I was going with that
you<00:02:43.260> got<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.440> make<00:02:43.620> sure<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.860> has<00:02:43.980> adequate

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you got to make sure it has adequate

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.590 
you got to make sure it has adequate
ventilation<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.970> also<00:02:45.209> need<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:45.480> sure

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
ventilation you also need to make sure

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.680 
ventilation you also need to make sure
your<00:02:45.930> case<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.860> overall<00:02:47.550> adequate<00:02:48.330> air<00:02:48.450> flow

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
your case has overall adequate air flow

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.630 
your case has overall adequate air flow
in<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.930> because<00:02:49.080> half<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> heat<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.490> going

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
in it because half of the heat is going

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.340 
in it because half of the heat is going
to<00:02:50.700> be<00:02:50.790> exhausted<00:02:51.060> directly<00:02:51.750> into<00:02:52.020> your<00:02:52.050> case

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
to be exhausted directly into your case

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.310 
to be exhausted directly into your case
out<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:53.310> side<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.630> fairly

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
out this side and then a fairly

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.600 
out this side and then a fairly
substantial<00:02:55.500> amount<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.550> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
substantial amount of it is going to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
substantial amount of it is going to
come<00:02:56.760> out<00:02:56.880> into<00:02:57.030> your<00:02:57.240> case<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.690> way<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
come out into your case this way and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.680 
come out into your case this way and
then<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.400> rest<00:02:59.580> will<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.880> exhausted<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
then the rest will be exhausted so this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.940 
then the rest will be exhausted so this
is<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> kick<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> fair<00:03:01.500> amount<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.800> heat

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
is going to kick a fair amount of heat

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.070 
is going to kick a fair amount of heat
into<00:03:02.190> your<00:03:02.310> case<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.720> got<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.959> make<00:03:04.050> sure

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
into your case and you got to make sure

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.720 
into your case and you got to make sure
you<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.470> lots<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.860> fans<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.340> keep<00:03:05.490> things
