millimeter<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.650> bit<00:00:25.740> more

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
millimeter this is a little bit more

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.609

millimeter<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.519> cost<00:00:29.760> significantly<00:00:30.000> more

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
millimeter which cost significantly more

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
millimeter which cost significantly more
it's<00:00:30.869> around<00:00:31.399> $2,700<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.000> time<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it's around $2,700 at the time of this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.010 
it's around $2,700 at the time of this
video<00:00:33.590> but<00:00:34.590> has<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.040> less<00:00:35.340> reach

video but has a little less reach
generally<00:00:37.020> speaking<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.559> everybody

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
generally speaking I think everybody

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.709 
generally speaking I think everybody
would<00:00:38.129> agree<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> Nikon<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.149> probably<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
would agree that the Nikon is probably a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
would agree that the Nikon is probably a
little<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:40.050> better<00:00:40.230> made<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.910> worth

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
little bit better made but is it worth

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.680 
little bit better made but is it worth
the<00:00:42.420> extra<00:00:42.980> $1700<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> Sigma<00:00:44.879> lens<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the extra $1700 over the Sigma lens so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
the extra $1700 over the Sigma lens so
before<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:46.829> actual<00:00:46.980> shoot<00:00:47.460> outs

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
before we get into an actual shoot outs

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
before we get into an actual shoot outs
to<00:00:47.879> compare<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.360> let's<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> quick

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to compare them let's do a quick

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
to compare them let's do a quick
physical<00:00:49.579> characteristics<00:00:50.579> comparison<00:00:51.180> so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
physical characteristics comparison so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
physical characteristics comparison so
let's<00:00:51.750> start<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> physical<00:00:52.379> comparison

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
let's start with the physical comparison

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
let's start with the physical comparison
of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> actual<00:00:53.850> lens<00:00:54.030> characteristics<00:00:54.870> here

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of the actual lens characteristics here

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
of the actual lens characteristics here
I<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> Sigma<00:00:56.309> lens<00:00:56.489> mounted<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:56.969> my

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I have the Sigma lens mounted on my

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
I have the Sigma lens mounted on my
tripod<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> camera<00:00:58.020> body<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
tripod to the camera body and I got the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.729 
tripod to the camera body and I got the
Nikon<00:00:59.250> lens<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.789> my<00:00:59.910> hand<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.870> collapsed

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
Nikon lens here in my hand now collapsed

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.729 
Nikon lens here in my hand now collapsed
on<00:01:01.890> both<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> Sigma

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
on both of them you can see if the Sigma

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.740 
on both of them you can see if the Sigma
lens<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.820> longer<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> lens

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
lens is a little longer with the lens

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.710 
lens is a little longer with the lens
hood<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> expand<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.240> both<00:01:09.420> out

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
hood on and when I expand them both out

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.770 
hood on and when I expand them both out
to<00:01:10.140> their<00:01:10.290> maximum<00:01:10.860> zoom<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> Sigma<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to their maximum zoom the Sigma is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.609 
to their maximum zoom the Sigma is
significantly<00:01:13.680> longer<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.490> also<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:16.409> we

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
significantly longer I also have if we

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.060 
significantly longer I also have if we
flip<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:18.470> like<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.590> said<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
flip it around here like I said in the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
flip it around here like I said in the
first<00:01:20.340> video<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.420> five<00:01:21.659> switches

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
first video you know I got five switches

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
first video you know I got five switches
here<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> Nikon<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.159> only<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.759> two

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
here on the Nikon one I only have two

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.749 
here on the Nikon one I only have two
switches<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> Sigma<00:01:25.259> lens<00:01:25.640> one<00:01:26.640> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
switches here on the Sigma lens one of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
switches here on the Sigma lens one of
them<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.240> lock<00:01:27.600> switch<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.110> further

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
them is a lock switch is with further

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
them is a lock switch is with further
forwards<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.400> third<00:01:29.640> switch<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
forwards that my third switch but to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.440 
forwards that my third switch but to
inline<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> lens<00:01:32.850> hoods<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.240> pretty

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
inline here the lens hoods are pretty

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.830 
inline here the lens hoods are pretty
similar

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
similar

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.690 
similar
the<00:01:34.320> biggest<00:01:34.530> difference<00:01:35.100> being<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the biggest difference being that this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
the biggest difference being that this
is<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.350> twist<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> off

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
is a one that you can twist on and off

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
is a one that you can twist on and off
this<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> nice<00:01:39.119> pin<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.049> can

design a little bit more weight wise
they're<00:01:45.930> pretty<00:01:46.140> similar<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.829> terms<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.549> like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
they're pretty similar in terms of like

actual width they're very similar and
weight<00:01:51.329> wise<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.140> similar<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
weight wise they're very similar so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
weight wise they're very similar so
physically<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.729> pretty<00:01:53.939> similar<00:01:54.180> lenses

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
physically they're pretty similar lenses

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.149 
physically they're pretty similar lenses
to<00:01:54.720> Sigma<00:01:55.020> being<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.649> longer<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to Sigma being a little bit longer but

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.190 
to Sigma being a little bit longer but
it's<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:56.880> got<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> hundred<00:01:57.540> millimeters<00:01:57.990> more

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's also got a hundred millimeters more

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
it's also got a hundred millimeters more
reach<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.890> Nikon<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.329> now

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
reach than the Nikon one does so now

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.300 
reach than the Nikon one does so now
let's<00:02:00.750> put<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> test<00:02:01.590> shooting<00:02:02.070> them<00:02:02.159> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
let's put them to a test shooting them I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
let's put them to a test shooting them I
will<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.790> how<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.090> rack<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.390> when<00:02:03.810> they're

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
will see how they rack up when they're

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
will see how they rack up when they're
attached<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.469> camera<00:02:04.829> two<00:02:05.399> months<00:02:05.670> ago<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
months since I purchased this lens and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.339 
months since I purchased this lens and
I've<00:02:38.330> had<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.599> chance<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:39.019> shoot<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
I've had a chance to shoot it

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.020 
I've had a chance to shoot it
exclusively<00:02:40.130> since<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.519> time<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.910> now<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
exclusively since that time and now I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.520 
exclusively since that time and now I
want<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.299> do<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> comparison<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
want to do a comparison of that to the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.309 
want to do a comparison of that to the
Sigma<00:02:42.769> 150<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.519> 500<00:02:43.730> millimeter<00:02:44.360> lens<00:02:44.540> now<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
Sigma 150 to 500 millimeter lens now the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.050 
Sigma 150 to 500 millimeter lens now the
Sigma<00:02:45.680> lens<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> fraction<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.700> costs

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
Sigma lens is a fraction of the costs

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.699 
Sigma lens is a fraction of the costs
were<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.299> little<00:02:47.599> less<00:02:47.780> than<00:02:47.989> thousand<00:02:48.440> dollars

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
were a little less than thousand dollars

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.039 
were a little less than thousand dollars
and<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.360> currently<00:02:50.360> selling<00:02:50.660> for<00:02:50.810> twenty

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
and this is currently selling for twenty

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.809 
and this is currently selling for twenty
eight<00:02:51.079> hundred<00:02:51.170> dollars<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.099> it's<00:02:52.310> almost<00:02:52.610> a

eight hundred dollars so it's almost a

it has a hundred millimeters more reach

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.559 
it has a hundred millimeters more reach

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
this is a little bit better in terms of

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.930 
this is a little bit better in terms of
its<00:03:03.769> aperture<00:03:04.220> range<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:04.579> they're<00:03:04.760> very

its aperture range but they're very
close<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.840> know<00:03:05.870> not<00:03:06.370> $1,700<00:03:07.370> worth<00:03:07.610> an

close you know not $1,700 worth an
aperture<00:03:08.150> difference<00:03:08.629> there<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.379> what<00:03:10.250> makes

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
around the outside of the lens so that

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.210 
around the outside of the lens so that
you<00:05:50.660> can<00:05:50.780> put<00:05:50.900> filters<00:05:51.110> on<00:05:51.410> there<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.860> those

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
like a polarizer that I intentionally

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.260 
like a polarizer that I intentionally
using<00:06:30.560> for<00:06:30.710> that<00:06:30.830> purpose<00:06:31.220> I<00:06:31.400> don't<00:06:31.910> put<00:06:32.030> any

other like protecting filters on there

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.430 
other like protecting filters on there
because<00:06:34.790> they're<00:06:35.000> just<00:06:35.090> gonna<00:06:35.240> mess<00:06:36.080> up<00:06:36.290> the

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
because they're just gonna mess up the

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.990 
because they're just gonna mess up the
quality<00:06:36.710> that<00:06:36.920> nikons<00:06:37.460> put<00:06:37.670> in<00:06:37.730> the<00:06:37.790> glass

here<00:06:38.300> I<00:06:38.570> do<00:06:39.020> leave<00:06:39.290> the<00:06:39.470> lens<00:06:39.620> hood<00:06:39.800> on<00:06:39.980> it<00:06:40.010> too

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
here I do leave the lens hood on it too

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.950 
here I do leave the lens hood on it too
all<00:06:40.340> the<00:06:40.460> time<00:06:40.490> so<00:06:41.090> if<00:06:41.210> I<00:06:41.300> did<00:06:41.480> drop<00:06:41.750> this

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
all the time so if I did drop this

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.750 
all the time so if I did drop this
worst-case<00:06:42.710> scenario<00:06:43.130> hopefully<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.610> only

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
worst-case scenario hopefully the only

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.310 
worst-case scenario hopefully the only
thing<00:06:43.910> I<00:06:44.000> break<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:44.360> the<00:06:44.450> lens<00:06:44.630> hood<00:06:44.780> not<00:06:45.050> any

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
thing I break is the lens hood not any

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.800 
thing I break is the lens hood not any
of<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.500> front<00:06:45.710> elements<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.280> use<00:06:47.120> a<00:06:47.150> monopod<00:06:47.540> to

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
of the front elements I use a monopod to

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.540 
of the front elements I use a monopod to
carry<00:06:48.020> this<00:06:48.170> lens<00:06:48.380> and<00:06:48.890> it<00:06:48.980> actually<00:06:49.160> tucks

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
carry this lens and it actually tucks

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.280 
carry this lens and it actually tucks
under<00:06:49.970> my<00:06:50.090> shoulder<00:06:50.420> pretty<00:06:50.570> nicely<00:06:50.840> in<00:06:51.080> fact

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
under my shoulder pretty nicely in fact

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.590 
under my shoulder pretty nicely in fact
I<00:06:51.410> can<00:06:51.560> let<00:06:51.710> go<00:06:51.740> no<00:06:52.640> hands<00:06:52.910> and<00:06:53.150> it'll<00:06:53.300> stay<00:06:53.570> on

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
I can let go no hands and it'll stay on

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.300 
I can let go no hands and it'll stay on
there<00:06:53.960> which<00:06:54.200> is<00:06:54.230> nice<00:06:54.500> for<00:06:54.710> carrying<00:06:55.070> around

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
there which is nice for carrying around

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.910 
there which is nice for carrying around

really like the amount of range and

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.590 
really like the amount of range and
power<00:07:33.770> that<00:07:34.100> this<00:07:34.250> lens<00:07:34.460> packs<00:07:34.820> for<00:07:35.210> that<00:07:35.330> size

millimeter lens yet when we compact it

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.850 
millimeter lens yet when we compact it
down<00:07:40.760> it's<00:07:41.360> only<00:07:41.480> that<00:07:41.720> big<00:07:41.750> that's<00:07:42.440> really

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860 
down it's only that big that's really

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.320
