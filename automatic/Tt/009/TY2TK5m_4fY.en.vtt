 series are curious facts that I 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.250
 I learned over time in gta five or 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 you may not know the size of this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.450
 new you 'll like it then well there it comes 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.140
 with me 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.879
 The first fact did you know that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 provoking ipc with your car 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.780
 accelerating and honking and going crazy 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.030
 try to do this with another car 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 you'll see how it goes. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 getting very crazy will pass the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.309
 red signs still counter hit 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 in the cars beating the pedestrian and going 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.750
 to be very crazy I find it interesting 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 that you sometimes you are alone 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.690
 and wants to make a run, will cause 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690
 or ipc 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.790
 according to the curious fact you knew that 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.250
 You can light fire with your car. 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.380
 so I tried putting gasoline behind the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.330
 your car and resembles your friend's car 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 I do not know any parked car makes 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.190
 something interesting to you 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.740
 cigip camera there with a gasoline and back 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.860
 in my car and now just accelerate and brake 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.660
 while burns here 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.170
 be careful of the plans to 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.170
 your car too 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.370
 the third curious fact is illegal and you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.790
 I knew you could hit your plane. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.790
 with your own missile you need to 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.310
 take a medium to high speed and pick up 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.489
 the right angle you can get 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.260
 at the time of the missile blast if it does not 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.459
 hit nothing he'll blow up soon 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.459
 airplane and hit you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.880
 People, I'll leave you with these. 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.310

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.600
