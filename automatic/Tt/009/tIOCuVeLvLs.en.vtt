so<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.300> now<00:00:58.420> suspect<00:00:58.719> something<00:00:59.530> wrong<00:00:59.739> with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
so we now suspect something wrong with

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.720 
so we now suspect something wrong with
the<00:01:00.730> lower<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.480> two<00:01:01.510> solenoids<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.829> I

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
the lower of the two solenoids and I

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.050 
the lower of the two solenoids and I
will<00:01:03.850> remove<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.300> first<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:06.430> piece<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.700> cloth

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
will remove it first some piece of cloth

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.530 
will remove it first some piece of cloth
under<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.510> because<00:01:07.869> there<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:09.850> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
under it because there is all the

you<00:01:24.729> say<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.740> few<00:01:27.130> turns<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.899> can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
you say so a few turns then you can

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:54.310 
you say so a few turns then you can
release<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.619> by<00:01:29.800> hand

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.800 

common<00:01:55.320> problem<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.450> rubber<00:01:57.450> gasket<00:01:57.840> is

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
common problem this rubber gasket is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.460 
common problem this rubber gasket is
damaged<00:02:02.120> you<00:02:03.120> can<00:02:03.150> replace<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:04.170> inner

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
damaged you can replace it the inner

house of a eight millimeter gasoline
house

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.170 

test<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.780> using<00:02:20.409> 12<00:02:20.890> volt<00:02:21.099> from<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.489> battery

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739 

there<00:02:25.180> should<00:02:25.329> be<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> distinct<00:02:26.290> click<00:02:27.359> this<00:02:28.359> is

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:28.749 
there should be a distinct click this is

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.119 
there should be a distinct click this is
not<00:02:29.590> enough

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
not enough

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:45.950 
not enough
I<00:02:35.459> removed<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:38.730> nozzle<00:02:40.829> like<00:02:41.829> this

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:56.089 

here<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.050> see<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.470> needle

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.780 

testing<00:02:56.909> again

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.700 

I<00:03:05.959> will<00:03:06.959> clean<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.200> with<00:03:07.590> pressurized<00:03:08.459> air

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.010 

there<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.400> no<00:03:13.580> clean<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:16.870> much<00:03:17.870> more<00:03:18.190> distinct

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
there is no clean and much more distinct

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.280 
there is no clean and much more distinct
you<00:03:21.020> can<00:03:21.170> try<00:03:21.350> this<00:03:21.410> once<00:03:22.420> but<00:03:23.420> they<00:03:23.840> wear<00:03:24.080> out

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
you can try this once but they wear out

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.970 
you can try this once but they wear out
fast

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
fast

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.510 
fast
this<00:03:25.280> little<00:03:25.670> buggers<00:03:28.570> new<00:03:29.570> ring<00:03:29.870> from<00:03:30.140> that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
this little buggers new ring from that

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:45.320 
this little buggers new ring from that
new<00:03:31.520> ceiling<00:03:32.350> like<00:03:33.350> this

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.369 

that's<00:03:45.960> new

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:04:09.370 

replace<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:50.469> with<00:03:51.469> this

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.160 

and<00:04:10.380> do<00:04:10.860> not<00:04:11.630> overtighten<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:13.550> just<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:16.109> you

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
and do not overtighten it just so you

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
and do not overtighten it just so you
feel<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.950> there<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:18.570> takes<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.109> stop

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.520 

they're<00:04:26.230> not<00:04:27.230> moral<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:30.050> finished<00:04:32.530> final

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
they're not moral I so finished final

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.480 
they're not moral I so finished final
click<00:04:33.740> test<00:04:38.290> well<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.410> think<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.980> can<00:04:40.160> hear<00:04:40.340> the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
click test well I think you can hear the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.850 
click test well I think you can hear the
difference
