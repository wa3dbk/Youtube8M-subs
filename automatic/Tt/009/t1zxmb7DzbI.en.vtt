00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to a new tutorial in the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.950
 which today we are going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.259
 origami or paper plane for it 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.509
 we are going to need a whole folio and 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.950
 well let's start the first thing that 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.320
 we have to do is double our 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.580
 folio well 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 in this way 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.590
 now we are going to open and we are going to double 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.850
 on the other hand 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.850
 that is to say so 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.500
 it does not have to be perfect at all 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500
 but 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.630
 now we open it and we have this we are going to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.410
 catch and let's do so 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.410
 and so 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.710
 A) Yes 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.270
 we mark the folds well 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we will have something good now let's 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.810
 catch this peak and we will take it here 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.990
 to the tip in this way 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.149
 so let's do the same with the other 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.149
 peak well 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.299
 we press well 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.600
 so that it is as perfect as possible and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.430
 we will have something like this very well now we are going 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.650
 to catch and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.650
 this is going to double it like this 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.030
 we squeeze 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.630
 and we do the same with the other side 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.630
 we take and bend in this way 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.380
 we squeeze 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.539
 so strong 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.520
 and now let's open and let's do what 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.840
 but for this other side we press 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.409
 we open 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.409
 we squeeze 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.399
 and we opened 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.330
 and now what we are going to do is having 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.840
 already the folds done we are going to double a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.410
 side we open up a bit like that and we doubled 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.030
 the other 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.440
 and we are going to make a peak like this here 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.860
 and we squeeze 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.850
 and the same thing to do with the other side 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.690
 we folded one side we folded the other 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.340
 and we're going to fold over here to do the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.410
 peak 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.910
 and we'll have two peaks like this now 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.770
 what we are going to do is 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 at the height of the peaks we are going to bend 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.880
 this back like that so it's not 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.410
 well I stayed with these two picks 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.130
 ok let's double 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.130
 in this way 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.460
 something like this will now be going to double 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 well in half 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.030
 to go making the rooms of our 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.110
 airplane 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.770
 well we tighten well 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.470
 we doubled back 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.510
 to make the wing itself 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.450
 we turn 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.959
 we doubled again 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.959
 we squeeze 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.620
 we will have more or less our plane 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.319
 done now let's take and here 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 let's make a cut let's do for 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.500
 here another cut 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.860
 let's do another cut here and here 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.270
 another cut and with this with this part 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.710
 down we're going to double this 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.680
 so this 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.040
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.740
 and we are going to take and we are going to do as 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:06.710
 a few ailerons upwards like that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:10.850
 and with this we will have our pretty 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:15.520
 plane made I hope you liked it 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.520
 this tutorial a greeting
