that good stuff but then I also thought

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.070 
that good stuff but then I also thought
of<00:01:15.060> something<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.509> cool<00:01:15.720> too<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> like

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of something really cool too is like

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
of something really cool too is like
imagine<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.890> part<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.280> since<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.580> can

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
imagine like this part so since it can

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.800 
imagine like this part so since it can
lift<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.299> bit<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> means<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
lift you up a little bit that means you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
lift you up a little bit that means you
can<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.110> top<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.350> gate<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.070> jump

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
can get on top of this gate so you jump

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.920 
can get on top of this gate so you jump
on<00:01:20.820> top<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.119> fence<00:01:21.240> jump<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
on top of the fence jump up here to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.330 
on top of the fence jump up here to
appear<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.590> imagine<00:01:23.220> there's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
appear don't be imagine there's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.499 
appear don't be imagine there's
something<00:01:23.400> even<00:01:23.820> better<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
something even better up there but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
something even better up there but
people<00:01:24.750> wouldn't<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.110> about<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.799> because

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
people wouldn't think about it because

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
people wouldn't think about it because
all<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.939> caring<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.080> chest

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
all that caring about is this one chest

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
all that caring about is this one chest
so<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.119> all<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> does

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so it's kind of like that's all it does

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
so it's kind of like that's all it does
it's<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:32.509> flush<00:01:33.509> fence<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.990> guess<00:01:34.280> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it's just a a flush fence I guess and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
it's just a a flush fence I guess and
you<00:01:35.369> can't<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:35.850> Pistons<00:01:36.270> whatsoever<00:01:36.869> at

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you can't see any Pistons whatsoever at

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.130 
you can't see any Pistons whatsoever at
all<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:38.100> Pistons

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
all no Pistons

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.960 
all no Pistons
so<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.740> mean<00:01:39.920> here's<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.280> Redstone<00:01:40.610> behind<00:01:40.850> it

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
so I mean here's the Redstone behind it

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.700 
so I mean here's the Redstone behind it
it's<00:01:41.090> not<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.600> bad<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.930> really<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.320> mean<00:01:42.590> it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
it's not that bad it really is I mean it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.680 
it's not that bad it really is I mean it
seems<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.820> seems<00:01:44.030> like<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.240> would<00:01:44.330> be<00:01:44.390> hard

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
seems it seems like it would be hard

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.360 
seems it seems like it would be hard
when<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.260> look<00:01:45.440> at<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.620> up<00:01:45.770> here<00:01:46.010> but<00:01:46.220> it's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
when you look at it up here but it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.890 
when you look at it up here but it's
really<00:01:46.640> not<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:47.120> bad<00:01:47.360> as<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.630> think<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.900> then

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
really not as bad as you think and then

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.180 
really not as bad as you think and then
I<00:01:50.930> actually<00:01:51.229> want<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.590> show<00:01:51.740> one<00:01:51.890> more<00:01:51.920> thing

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
I actually want to show one more thing

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.810 
I actually want to show one more thing
now<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.580> my<00:01:52.760> last<00:01:52.940> video<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.300> did<00:01:53.540> Tom<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:54.820> secret

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
now on my last video I did Tom a secret

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.180 
now on my last video I did Tom a secret
staircase<00:01:56.090> off<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.630> wall<00:01:56.840> which<00:01:57.830> goes<00:01:58.040> down

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
staircase off the wall which goes down

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
staircase off the wall which goes down
and<00:01:58.369> like<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.610> basement<00:01:58.790> or<00:01:59.090> something

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
and like a basement or something

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.570 
and like a basement or something
whatever<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.810> guys<00:01:59.930> want<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> guy

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
whatever you guys want for it but a guy

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.859 
whatever you guys want for it but a guy
asked<00:02:01.850> me<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.060> comments<00:02:02.479> he's<00:02:02.570> like<00:02:02.720> can

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
asked me in the comments he's like can

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.149 
asked me in the comments he's like can
you<00:02:02.900> make<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> sliding<00:02:03.500> wall<00:02:03.890> or<00:02:04.070> something

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
you make a sliding wall or something

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.350 
you make a sliding wall or something
like<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.550> was<00:02:04.790> like<00:02:04.820> thinking<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.270> myself

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
like that I was like thinking to myself

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.420 
like that I was like thinking to myself
like<00:02:05.690> what<00:02:05.960> does<00:02:06.170> he<00:02:06.229> mean<00:02:06.320> by<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> sliding<00:02:07.280> wall

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
like what does he mean by a sliding wall

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.990 
like what does he mean by a sliding wall
so<00:02:07.940> hopefully<00:02:08.720> he<00:02:08.840> watches<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.259> video<00:02:09.380> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so hopefully he watches this video and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.310 
so hopefully he watches this video and
this<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.150> what<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> kind<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.750> thought<00:02:11.930> when<00:02:12.290> he

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
this is what I kind of thought when he

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.770 
this is what I kind of thought when he
told<00:02:12.830> me<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.100> is<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.180> click<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:14.450> lever

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
told me that is so if I click this lever

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.740 
told me that is so if I click this lever
up<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:16.550> see<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:16.760> wall<00:02:16.970> slides<00:02:17.239> back<00:02:17.510> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
up I just see this wall slides back and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.030 
up I just see this wall slides back and
then<00:02:17.840> there's<00:02:18.019> two<00:02:18.170> different<00:02:18.350> direction<00:02:18.709> go

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
then there's two different direction go

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.490 
then there's two different direction go
down<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> hallway<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.900> come<00:02:21.140> out<00:02:21.260> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
down the hallway you know come out and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.810 
down the hallway you know come out and
of<00:02:21.709> course<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.130> don't<00:02:22.250> need<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> lever<00:02:22.640> I'm

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
of course you don't need a lever I'm

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.160 
of course you don't need a lever I'm
just<00:02:23.030> doing<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.239> lever<00:02:23.390> because<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.870> really

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
just doing the lever because it's really

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.160 
just doing the lever because it's really
simple<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.160> there<00:02:25.550> all<00:02:26.420> these<00:02:26.660> things<00:02:26.900> i<00:02:27.019> can
