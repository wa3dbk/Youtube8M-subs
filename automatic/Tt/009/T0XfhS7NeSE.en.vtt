00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
they tell me I don't know how fast

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.399 
they tell me I don't know how fast
you're<00:01:44.689> gonna<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:45.020> better<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:47.170> went<00:01:48.170> from<00:01:48.229> the

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
you're gonna get better I went from the

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.899 
you're gonna get better I went from the
very<00:01:48.439> top<00:01:48.860> from<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.460> biggest<00:01:49.729> race<00:01:49.880> of

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
very top from one of the biggest race of

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:50.440 
very top from one of the biggest race of
the<00:01:50.060> year

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
the year

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.149 
the year
so<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> very<00:01:50.899> bottom<00:01:51.229> being<00:01:51.560> out<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:51.979> five

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
so the very bottom being out for five

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.330 
so the very bottom being out for five
weeks<00:01:52.369> because<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:52.880> was<00:01:53.000> sick<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:54.130> was<00:01:55.130> really

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
weeks because I was sick I was really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.520 
weeks because I was sick I was really
intentional<00:01:55.789> about<00:01:55.850> seeing<00:01:56.539> what<00:01:57.350> he<00:01:57.409> was

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
intentional about seeing what he was

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.899 
intentional about seeing what he was
doing<00:01:57.799> through<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:58.069> all<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> think<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.789> was

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
doing through it all so I think that was

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.330 
doing through it all so I think that was
a<00:01:58.940> great<00:01:59.179> thing<00:01:59.649> even<00:02:00.649> though<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.069> not

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
a great thing even though I was not

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.649 
a great thing even though I was not
racing<00:02:01.700> for<00:02:01.819> five<00:02:01.909> weeks<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.240> was<00:02:02.299> great<00:02:02.539> for

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
racing for five weeks it was great for

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.999 
racing for five weeks it was great for
me<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.869> get<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.080> reflect<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.649> what<00:02:03.830> he<00:02:03.920> had

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
me to get to reflect on what he had

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.190 
me to get to reflect on what he had
previously<00:02:04.310> done<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.179> what<00:02:05.750> he<00:02:05.810> was<00:02:05.899> doing

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
previously done and what he was doing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.289 
previously done and what he was doing
right<00:02:06.380> then<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:07.549> then<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.729> look<00:02:07.940> back<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.239> I

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
right then and so then I look back and I

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.180 
right then and so then I look back and I
see<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.509> Daytona<00:02:08.869> 500<00:02:09.110> which<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.860> thought<00:02:10.039> was

see the Daytona 500 which I thought was

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.680
