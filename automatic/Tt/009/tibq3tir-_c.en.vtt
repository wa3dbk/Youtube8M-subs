take<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> step<00:01:04.559> backward<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> important

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
take a step backward which is important

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.140 
take a step backward which is important
and<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.930> gives<00:01:07.470> us<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> chance<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.030> kind

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and it gives us now a chance to to kind

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
and it gives us now a chance to to kind
of<00:01:09.299> zero<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.260> eight<00:01:10.439> selection<00:01:11.040> we've

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
of zero in on that eight selection we've

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
of zero in on that eight selection we've
got<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> better<00:01:12.060> idea<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.650> pool

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
got a better idea of what that pool

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
got a better idea of what that pool
looks<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.700> opposed<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> moving<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
looks like as opposed to moving back and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
looks like as opposed to moving back and
having<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.500> wider<00:01:16.740> range<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
having a little bit wider range of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.050 
having a little bit wider range of
players<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> look<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.369> I'd<00:01:20.369> say<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.939> all

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
players to look at so I'd say all in all

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
want to ask you one question about the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.880 
want to ask you one question about the
lottery<00:03:23.940> itself<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:24.630> an<00:03:24.750> event<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.680> saw

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
lottery itself as an event and we saw

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.759 
lottery itself as an event and we saw

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
you in secaucus in 2006 when you won the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.160 
you in secaucus in 2006 when you won the
number<00:03:29.040> one<00:03:29.190> pick<00:03:29.660> talk<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:30.900> how<00:03:31.019> this

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
number one pick talk about how this

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.819 
number one pick talk about how this
event<00:03:31.680> itself<00:03:32.040> has<00:03:32.310> grown<00:03:32.760> as<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.570> big<00:03:34.230> time<00:03:34.470> NBA

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
event itself has grown as a big time NBA

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.340 
event itself has grown as a big time NBA
van<00:03:35.130> well<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.090> big<00:03:36.420> time<00:03:36.630> NBA<00:03:36.930> event

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
van well it's a big time NBA event

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.170 
van well it's a big time NBA event
especially<00:03:37.680> when<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.220> got<00:03:38.370> certain<00:03:38.940> players

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
especially when you got certain players

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.340 
especially when you got certain players
on<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.049> board<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.560> year<00:03:42.230> when<00:03:43.230> you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
on the board like this year when you

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.620 
on the board like this year when you
look<00:03:43.560> at<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:44.250> know<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.700> order<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
look at you know the order and the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.650 
look at you know the order and the
structure<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.500> event<00:03:46.799> itself<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.400> do<00:03:48.150> think

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
structure of the event itself I do think

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.660 
structure of the event itself I do think
that<00:03:48.720> maybe<00:03:49.079> we<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.100> start<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> look

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
that maybe we can you know start to look

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.150 
that maybe we can you know start to look
at<00:03:50.910> ways<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.150> tweak<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.780> process<00:03:52.470> whether

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
at ways to tweak the process whether

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.220 
at ways to tweak the process whether
it's<00:03:53.459> tweaking<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> lottery<00:03:54.360> itself<00:03:54.930> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
it's tweaking the lottery itself and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.970 
it's tweaking the lottery itself and
maybe<00:03:55.410> not<00:03:56.120> basing<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.269> odds<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.780> draft<00:03:58.709> or

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
maybe not basing the odds on draft or

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.759 
maybe not basing the odds on draft or
excuse<00:03:59.250> me<00:03:59.400> position<00:04:00.299> of<00:04:00.480> your<00:04:00.660> record<00:04:01.170> maybe

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
excuse me position of your record maybe

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.560 
excuse me position of your record maybe
it's<00:04:01.920> number<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.310> wins<00:04:02.640> maybe<00:04:03.060> there's<00:04:03.360> some

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
it's number of wins maybe there's some

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.590 
it's number of wins maybe there's some
kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.930> because<00:04:04.970> number<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:06.000> through

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
kind of because number one through

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.770 
kind of because number one through
number<00:04:07.530> let's<00:04:08.250> say<00:04:08.430> 10<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.940> year<00:04:09.000> were

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
number let's say 10 this year were

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.800 
number let's say 10 this year were
separated<00:04:10.500> by<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.920> few<00:04:11.280> games<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.570> game

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
separated by so few games that one game

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.150 
separated by so few games that one game
here<00:04:13.049> one<00:04:13.230> game<00:04:13.500> there<00:04:13.769> could<00:04:13.980> make<00:04:14.130> a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
here one game there could make a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.800 
here one game there could make a
difference<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:14.820> think<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.180> leads<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.690> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
difference and I think that leads to the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.550 
difference and I think that leads to the
anticipation<00:04:16.440> or<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.180> criticism<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.560> teams

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
anticipation or the criticism that teams

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.279 
anticipation or the criticism that teams
are<00:04:19.739> taking<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:21.030> get<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.780> better

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
are taking to to get to a better

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.170 
are taking to to get to a better
position<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:23.099> terms<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.610> odds<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:24.030> winning

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
position in terms of the odds of winning

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.840 
position in terms of the odds of winning
the<00:04:24.419> lottery<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.020> do<00:04:25.229> think<00:04:25.620> we

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
the lottery so I do think we

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.020 
the lottery so I do think we
need<00:04:25.970> as<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.480> league<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:27.020> need<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.260> address<00:04:27.590> that

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
need as a league we need to address that

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.400 
need as a league we need to address that
because<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.360> really<00:04:29.630> it's<00:04:29.750> not<00:04:29.930> fair<00:04:30.350> to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
because it's really it's not fair to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.620 
because it's really it's not fair to
know<00:04:31.100> season<00:04:31.550> seat<00:04:31.730> older<00:04:31.970> I've<00:04:32.240> got<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.510> give

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
know season seat older I've got to give

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.720 
know season seat older I've got to give
Duane<00:04:32.960> absolute<00:04:33.590> credit<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.550> he<00:04:34.700> handled

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
Duane absolute credit the way he handled

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.760 
Duane absolute credit the way he handled
this<00:04:35.150> season<00:04:35.510> he<00:04:35.630> would<00:04:35.780> not<00:04:35.960> let<00:04:36.200> these<00:04:36.410> our

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
this season he would not let these our

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.600 
this season he would not let these our
players<00:04:37.540> lay<00:04:38.540> down<00:04:38.570> he<00:04:39.050> would<00:04:39.230> not<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.800> any<00:04:40.400> way

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
players lay down he would not in any way

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.720 
players lay down he would not in any way
shape<00:04:40.760> or<00:04:41.180> form<00:04:41.240> go<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.230> coach<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.770> lose<00:04:43.010> he

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
shape or form go in and coach to lose he

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.670 
shape or form go in and coach to lose he
coached<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.210> win<00:04:44.360> every<00:04:44.630> game<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.590> know

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
coached the win every game and you know

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.160 
coached the win every game and you know
I<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:46.040> we<00:04:46.310> grew<00:04:46.550> because<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.570> process

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
I think we grew because of that process

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.200 
I think we grew because of that process
that<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:48.800> part<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.250> culture<00:04:49.670> change<00:04:50.000> and

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
that was part of the culture change and

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.690 
that was part of the culture change and
that<00:04:50.270> was<00:04:50.450> part<00:04:50.690> of<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.890> shift<00:04:52.160> there<00:04:52.430> and

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
that was part of the the shift there and

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.720 
that was part of the the shift there and
and<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.120> was<00:04:53.330> it's<00:04:54.020> telling<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.650> see<00:04:54.830> also<00:04:55.220> how

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
and it was it's telling to see also how

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.290 
and it was it's telling to see also how
guys<00:04:56.000> compete<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.410> I<00:04:57.710> would<00:04:58.520> say<00:04:58.730> that<00:04:58.970> you

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
guys compete so I would say that you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.450 
guys compete so I would say that you
know<00:04:59.420> this<00:05:00.020> process<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.800> it's<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.130> great

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
know this process is it's a great

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.850 
know this process is it's a great
process<00:05:01.760> it's<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.240> great<00:05:02.480> show<00:05:02.860> somebody
