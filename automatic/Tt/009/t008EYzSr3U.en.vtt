00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.390
 soaked when wet 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.929
 Do not get soaked from the 11 Aug 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.039

 teachers of ajó 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.020
 and in the americas 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.020
 well first of all we take the almonds 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.580
 if we put them 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.080
 this side of the box 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 in a glass for titles 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 once the almonds are put 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 we went through here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 and we add the two cloves of garlic 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 and crew 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.380
 javier losada 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 to the smallest of the almonds 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.580
 we will beat again 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 until more or less than 9 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 as a gender 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 we are that it costs us to put a little water 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 now we will add 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.230
 we will all pass past to proceed to rectify the vinegar that three 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
 rooms of the same 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.129
 we beat one eye 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 and then 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 prepare to add oil little by little they went to older 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.209
 the truce mix 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.789
 we are going to change containers 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.889
 the bus manager 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.989
 these two jobs 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.839
 us who 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.409
 time to have them ready mix 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.269
 we just lack and adding water 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.269
 divorcing 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 that's why we believe the mixture that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.299
 you have to add a liter of water 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.209
 then we cover 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.359
 if we put in the refrigerator until it is cold admonished to try to eat well 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.279

 rotated cadiz 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.519

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.329
 with some grapes when we see them 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.139
 but we will pick them up 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.349
 this measure that we are going to be very present
