00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
something it's really important to show

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.390 
something it's really important to show
exactly<00:03:16.049> how<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.440> did<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.220> probably

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
exactly how I did it you can probably

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
exactly how I did it you can probably
even<00:03:17.670> use<00:03:18.359> my<00:03:18.389> dears<00:03:18.900> because<00:03:19.170> they<00:03:19.319> are

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
even use my dears because they are

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.789 
even use my dears because they are
unique<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:19.980> me<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.959> obviously<00:03:21.959> slaying<00:03:22.560> cruel

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
unique to me and obviously slaying cruel

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.140 
unique to me and obviously slaying cruel
is<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.280> going<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.549> be<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.670> good<00:03:23.880> percentage

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
is that's going to be a good percentage

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.030 
is that's going to be a good percentage
because<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.780> hey<00:03:24.989> then<00:03:25.260> things<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.739> said

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
because I hey then things like I said

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.729 
because I hey then things like I said
earlier<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> yeah<00:03:27.450> that's<00:03:27.840> that's<00:03:28.200> this<00:03:28.590> is

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
earlier so yeah that's that's this is

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.259 
earlier so yeah that's that's this is
actually<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.220> must<00:03:29.459> major<00:03:29.670> adduction<00:03:29.970> video

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
actually you must major adduction video
