 nostalgic and wanted to see the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.019
 code starts qg well it will not be 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.620
 in this video because I fuck you and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.620
 will take the front 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.590
 I 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 hello everyone happened when 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.130
 go on this wonderful Wednesday there 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.750
 weather is sunny it's hot 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.490
 we will be able to tan like pigs 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.660
 then I'll stop you right away 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.100
 so that you avoid saying bullshit 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.300
 because it's raining there's a lot of wind 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.320
 any case me my name is the balls 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.820
 so you 'll immediately stop 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.170
 tell lies to those who watch 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.490
 this video especially that it's not the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.470
 all a beautiful jouault because you 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.390
 again this commentary for the umpteenth 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.080
 time then take it back if not you will have 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.060
 a kick in the ass 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.530
 ok ok ok go go sleep the old yes I 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.970
 know it was supposed to represent an old 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.290
 but hey I did as I could 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.010
 do as if you believed it will be 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.020
 our discipline 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.280
 no one will be short today we get 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.200
 found on call of duty black ops the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.619
 a little return on this opus will not do 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.790
 of evil 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.320
 eric fouard vogue lately 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.300
 there are a lot of videos on call of duty 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.650
 kid of already cases n massacres 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.850
 attempts at discoveries and 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.860
 records so today I you 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.240
 offers a gameplay of my friend what 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.490
 said the person I'm doing 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.110
 videos on youtube on black ops the 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.670
 packs loaded on the map even she gives 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.200
 and as you will see my little 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.910
 this profit's chicken it's hot potato 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.440
 so open your eyes 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.729
 so I intend to send this 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.990
 gameplay at co2 judged as you could 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.720
 see it in the introduction 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.160
 there is too much co2 qg and so that's 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.409
 would like to pass on this channel for 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.760
 get a real community to whom we 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.620
 could offer videos 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.480
 so if we are lead, thank them 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.370
 enormously it's a real service that 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.120
 will then render us as the video is 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.100
 very short 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.870
 I will give you advice it's 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.400
 gone so there are three things in this 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.530
 mode to respect to become a true 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.420
 pro gamer masters as our friend made himself 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.080
 obviously I'm kidding because this guy is a 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.610
 noob then the displacements the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 command that you will take for my 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.299
 share it will be pizza four cheese sauce 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.830
 barbecue obviously those qg codes that 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.320
 pay no worries you can 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.980
 choose mcdo or kebabs so then the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.230
 sensitivity 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.950
 so it's gone then the displacements 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.380
 what do I mean by the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.700
 moves just play 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.440
 tactical go around the map do not 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.880
 to do like this jerk of this son it's 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.440
 to say to walk in the middle of the map 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.470
 but hey does not care it's crazy 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 performance go so did the trick 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.170
 of the map or then manage an area it's 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.519
 to say that cuttings is neither you 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.290
 go back because there will be all the 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.310
 time at least one guy who goes spawn in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.840
 the second that will follow 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.390
 so that's very important in this 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 mode is partly to know the spl 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.570
 then the orders so it's not 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.040
 very important but it's a good advice 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.810
 for those who are used to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 shot drugs specially for this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.160
 default mode if you have 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.330
 a tactical play terminal 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.460
 but knives are something 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.650
 that we close and especially last 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.680
 on this game and to finish the sensitivity 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.700
 which I advise and 4 or 5 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.200
 because it's useless to take a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.430
 very very big sensitivity because you 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.110
 will not have the best football you need 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.700
 for this mode because remember you 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.320
 have only one bullet so on that it's 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.060
 already finished I hope you liked 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.470
 and I say good day or good 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.470
 evening to the next all
