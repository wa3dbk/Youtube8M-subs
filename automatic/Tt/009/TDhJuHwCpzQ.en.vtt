00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello i am sasja and today we go 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.389
 watch the nikon team 24 mm in the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 shed we naturally find the lenses 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.929
 yourself a sun canopy and pouch and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.929
 documentation 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 here we see the zoom ring and this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.150
 focus ring with the focus behind it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 little sheep 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.140
 and switch all the way on this side 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.949
 to switch between mayo focus and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.949
 auto focus 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 we see here the 1024 mounted on one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
 nikon d7000 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 he lays very nicely in the hand and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.269
 is well balanced and very nice 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 fine semi-professional ultra wide angle 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.260
 for the clubs and they don't come 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 cameras he works at all clubs and so on 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.070
 I like us because he himself has and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 autofocus motor and focusing old 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.369
 pretty fast 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 sum here on the shortest distance 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.570
 to very far 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.290
 then we see here that it is pretty fast 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.519
 can focus over a considerable distance 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 we see some test photos here 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.280
 taken with the nikon 1024 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 Finally, let's take a look at 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 always shot with this 1024 we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 have a sharp map on this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 aperture 4.5 and there we see that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.400
 details are pretty sharp as with 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.440
 fully open aperture but if they are there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.940
 f8 go then they are just that little bit 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 sharp but the difference is very big 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 small with that we can conclude that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.369
 this lens from 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.970
 very much in all aperture positions 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.159
 sharp when we look at the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.100
 to the distortion then we see on this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.080
 10 mm quite a bit of distortion but good 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.320
 that is normal for a big angle that 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.390
 if nothing is frames on 24 mm then it will come 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 back as a spherical title 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.110
 distortion but it really is very bad 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.410
 at least also performs on this area, the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 1024 very good and also in terms of vignetting 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.220
 this lens performs quite well because 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.929
 a see here aperture 3.5 is complete 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.670
 open at 10 mm 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.950
 and there is not a lot of jetting 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.810
 present when we go to aperture 8 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.810
 then it becomes even less 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.090
 I could find few negatives 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.250
 because it is a lens that is just real 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.530
 very good but despite it really is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.390
 what should mention it is a dx objective 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 and so you can not use fx camera 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.170
 use 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.019
 really a very good image quality 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.260
 few members mistakes and good ones 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.260
 construction 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 are you looking for an extreme one 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.370
 wide angle lens for your nikon camera with 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.930
 aforementioned plus points 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.640
 be sure to check out this mini comes 10 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.140
 24 mm
