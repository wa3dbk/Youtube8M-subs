was<00:01:42.220> spent<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.790> decent<00:01:43.150> amount<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.630> time

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
was spent a decent amount of time

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.780 
was spent a decent amount of time
shooting<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.830> got<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> shooting<00:01:45.580> coach

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
helped me out a lot with some my

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.859 
helped me out a lot with some my
technique<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.790> stuff<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.840> a

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
technique and stuff like that get a

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.600 
technique and stuff like that get a
certain<00:01:53.200> amount<00:01:53.229> of<00:01:53.440> shots<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.890> each<00:01:54.040> it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
certain amount of shots in each it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.400 
certain amount of shots in each it
depends<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.150> like<00:01:55.300> how<00:01:55.450> my<00:01:55.600> legs<00:01:55.840> are<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.200> day

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
depends on like how my legs are that day

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.290 
depends on like how my legs are that day
because<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.280> try<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.490> make<00:01:57.759> sure<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.090> quality

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
because we try to make sure the quality

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.160 
because we try to make sure the quality
is<00:01:58.540> still<00:01:58.750> there<00:01:58.930> but<00:01:58.960> is<00:02:00.900> probably<00:02:01.900> at<00:02:02.020> least

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
is still there but is probably at least

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.560 
is still there but is probably at least

before the lockout is ninety percent of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.320 
before the lockout is ninety percent of
its<00:02:30.280> going<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.489> be<00:02:30.550> improving<00:02:30.850> things<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
its going to be improving things on the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.449 
its going to be improving things on the
defensive<00:02:31.840> end<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> mean<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:33.190> something

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
defensive end so I mean that's something

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.800 
defensive end so I mean that's something
that<00:02:33.670> whether<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.060> had<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> new<00:02:34.390> coaching<00:02:34.660> staff

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
that whether we had a new coaching staff

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.360 
that whether we had a new coaching staff
or<00:02:35.140> an<00:02:35.200> old<00:02:35.320> coaching<00:02:35.650> staff<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:35.980> something<00:02:36.280> we

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
or an old coaching staff is something we

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.250 
or an old coaching staff is something we
we<00:02:36.670> needed<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.030> start<00:02:37.239> over<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.989> begin

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
we needed to start over from to begin

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.130 
we needed to start over from to begin
with<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.019> main

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
with so that that's going to be the main

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.050 
with so that that's going to be the main
focus<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.709> know<00:02:41.980> offensively<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> ton

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
focus I know offensively we have a ton

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.340 
focus I know offensively we have a ton
of<00:02:43.120> weapons<00:02:43.480> already<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.930> I'm<00:02:43.989> sure<00:02:44.170> we're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
of weapons already and I'm sure we're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.130 
of weapons already and I'm sure we're
looking<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> add<00:02:44.739> some<00:02:45.040> but<00:02:45.959> defensively<00:02:46.959> we

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
looking to add some but defensively we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.810 
looking to add some but defensively we
have<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.350> start<00:02:47.560> over<00:02:47.680> anyway<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.670> what

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
have to start over anyway so it is what

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.949 
have to start over anyway so it is what
it<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.090> I'm<00:02:49.360> looking<00:02:49.600> forward<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.840> working

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it is and I'm looking forward to working

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.690 
it is and I'm looking forward to working
with<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.140> new<00:02:50.260> staff<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.739> think<00:02:51.370> that's<00:02:51.519> going<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
with a new staff I think that's going to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.620 
with a new staff I think that's going to
be<00:02:51.790> tough<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.060> haven't<00:02:52.299> really<00:02:52.420> been<00:02:52.570> around

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
be tough I haven't really been around

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.080 
be tough I haven't really been around
long<00:02:53.110> enough<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.410> fully<00:02:54.190> understand

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
long enough to fully understand

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.170 
long enough to fully understand
everything<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.860> know<00:02:56.950> what<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.489> mean<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
everything but you know what I mean the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.850 
everything but you know what I mean the
guys<00:02:58.360> are<00:02:58.540> talking<00:02:58.870> about<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.230> at<00:02:59.350> least<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.829> i

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
guys are talking about it at least and i

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.500 
guys are talking about it at least and i
think<00:03:00.100> that's<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.610> important<00:03:01.150> but

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
think that's that's important but

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
think that's that's important but
obviously<00:03:01.900> we're<00:03:02.290> going<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.590> our<00:03:02.620> backs

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
obviously we're going to have our backs

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.350 
obviously we're going to have our backs
against<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.220> wall<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.610> young<00:03:03.850> team<00:03:03.880> new

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
against the wall with a young team new

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.900 
against the wall with a young team new
coach<00:03:04.630> new<00:03:04.660> system<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.500> not<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.160> lot<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.400> time<00:03:06.640> I

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
coach new system and not a lot of time I

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.430 
coach new system and not a lot of time I
don't<00:03:07.450> think<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.840> much<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
don't think it's that much of a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.660 
don't think it's that much of a
difference<00:03:08.470> than<00:03:08.829> what<00:03:08.920> everybody<00:03:09.160> else<00:03:09.340> is

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
difference than what everybody else is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.280 
difference than what everybody else is
going<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.269> have<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.540> deal<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.019> with<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
going to have to deal with is with the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.400 
going to have to deal with is with the
