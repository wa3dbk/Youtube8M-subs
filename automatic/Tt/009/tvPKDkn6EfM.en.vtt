00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.730
 It's like being better and good stress 1 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.290
 moya mount bone or mod 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.750
 you realize it is the mod that 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.150
 simply add the new one because 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.580
 is for to collect what sells 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.110
 being a bone milk and just already 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.690
 stop killing so many skeletons when 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.860
 we need to do many crops not 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.200
 now we can finally get it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 from a block the thousand bow because many 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
 sometimes we are being crops and what 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.320
 The only thing that happens is that we are simply 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 We are running out of bone and we can not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 grow fast because our crops 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.960
 to progress and in good 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.609
 we just use the tumen items to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 have the bonus 1000 but if you want 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.230
 play then yes in normal survival and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 it requires many thousand, so here we have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 this way that will be very useful for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 that not then then they will account 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 let's find so you can in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.330
 some parts of the surface and in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.120
 caves the new gold that is this and what 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.340
 I can master with a stone peak 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.500
 a peak of iron the truth 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.650
 practically then I think that even with 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.870
 wood if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.870
 let's put a wood 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 29 wood I'm not sure if I think that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.979
 with wood I do not know I think we're going to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 see even with the snowfall can be 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.690
 then there is no problem for that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.250
 so then we simply have to 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.530
 collect our gold going on has 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.740
 much more we collect here we are going to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.990
 collect one with each a boom boom 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 boom pow since we have our now if 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.790
 it's just going to be like an iron 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.990
 so it gives you solid and the only thing 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
 we have to do it is to put it in 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.550
 our stove for everything to work 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 opi here we have our little stove we put 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.380
 here cold and it's going to start frying like this 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.790
 like toast thank you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.790
 prepare their moms 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.220
 ready 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 there we have our bone and simply 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.569
 that's where we have super blue bonfire 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.459
 we can collect enough 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.439
 and is everything that is not very 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.909
 simple as I say but I wanted to 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.889
 make a video since I take as a 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.780
 week without making videos because already 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.370
 I had told them in the last video that 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.499
 I was going to start my final exam period 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.890
 and what do I have to do then enough 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.110
 I have to study a lot 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.150
 and therefore so it is quite busy 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.950
 but I said right now I have a little bit 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.450
 time to show a mod even if it's not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.080
 very sophisticated but I have lost having a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.790
 video to the channel 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.550
 and well, because they liked that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.830
 is the reason there is not much left for 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.300
 I finished my exams in case it is in itself 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.130
 they were interested, I know that most of us 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.240
 interesting but nothing more in case they are 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.730
 asking why there are not so many 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.620
 videos on the channel is why a coarse 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.930
 where the epoch ends the time of this 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.030
 section is final are semi-annual 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.190
 and others and since I finished them then 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.080
 just give it to full not then 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.570
 because none of that it liked this 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.060
 little mod with our perfect mobile 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.320
 there we can grow whatever we want 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.030
 I do not like that they added albo 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.580
 thousand was that to grow trees the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.960
 jungle because we spend a lot of bone 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.740
 milk and then also for carrots 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.209
 and well, these micro creators 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.980
 They are the loquitos but it can make us 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.550
 nothing about it 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.500
 as a team it is true and it is true that he lost 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 then leave a like with comments 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.129
 favorites and well if in this time water 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.470
 try to climb even if there are not many 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.599
 long but I've lost content 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.890
 So, well, do not give us the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.890
 next and goodbye
