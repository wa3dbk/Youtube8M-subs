00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
but this makes it a little bit easier

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.389 
but this makes it a little bit easier
for<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> quickly<00:02:04.590> match<00:02:04.799> something

you from my own personal experience I

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.280 
you from my own personal experience I
have<00:03:56.829> worn<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.459> foundation<00:03:58.239> I've<00:03:58.840> put<00:03:59.139> this

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
have worn this foundation I've put this

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.740 
have worn this foundation I've put this
on<00:03:59.500> brides<00:03:59.889> they've<00:04:00.669> used<00:04:01.060> flash<00:04:01.449> photography

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
on brides they've used flash photography

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.069 
on brides they've used flash photography
and<00:04:02.680> they've<00:04:03.459> been<00:04:03.699> just<00:04:04.060> fine<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:04.719> it<00:04:04.840> does

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
and they've been just fine and it does

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.469 
and they've been just fine and it does
have<00:04:05.349> an<00:04:05.530> SPF<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:06.219> it<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.519> think<00:04:06.879> that<00:04:06.939> people

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
have an SPF in it I think that people

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.890 
have an SPF in it I think that people
need<00:04:08.289> to<00:04:08.469> understand<00:04:09.069> what<00:04:09.400> they're<00:04:09.579> doing<00:04:10.030> if

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
need to understand what they're doing if
