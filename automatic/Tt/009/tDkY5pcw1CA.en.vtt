great<00:01:15.780> close-up<00:01:16.229> footage<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.460> tools<00:01:17.670> in

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
great close-up footage of the tools in

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.540 
great close-up footage of the tools in
action<00:01:18.440> we'll<00:01:19.440> look<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.130> body<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
action we'll look at using your body to

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.310 
action we'll look at using your body to
shape<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> work<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.780> fluid<00:01:22.140> body

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
shape the work because fluid body

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320 
shape the work because fluid body
movements<00:01:22.890> help<00:01:23.070> reduce<00:01:23.430> flowing<00:01:23.880> curves<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
movements help reduce flowing curves on

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
movements help reduce flowing curves on
the<00:01:24.420> lathe<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.320> perfect<00:01:25.740> edge<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the lathe or the perfect edge of the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.669 
the lathe or the perfect edge of the
grinder<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.810> meet<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.200> using

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
grinder so what do I meet about using

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.340 
grinder so what do I meet about using
your<00:01:28.770> body<00:01:29.450> I've<00:01:30.450> been<00:01:30.630> told<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.110> great

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
your body I've been told I have a great

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.320 
your body I've been told I have a great
pair<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> hands<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.160> certainly<00:01:32.940> my<00:01:33.090> hands

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
pair of hands and certainly my hands

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.570 
pair of hands and certainly my hands
hold<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> tools<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:34.710> feet<00:01:34.920> take<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
hold the tools my feet take me to the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.640 
hold the tools my feet take me to the
lathe<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.750> body<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.229> shapes<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lathe but it's my body that shapes the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
lathe but it's my body that shapes the
piece<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.549> legs<00:01:38.759> shoulders<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.390> arms<00:01:39.630> all

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
piece my legs shoulders and arms all

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.710 
piece my legs shoulders and arms all
moving<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.860> rhythm<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.210> sure<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
moving and rhythm so not sure about the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230 
moving and rhythm so not sure about the
phrase<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.930> great<00:01:43.229> pair<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> hands<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.240> great

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
phrase a great pair of hands a great

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
phrase a great pair of hands a great
body<00:01:45.540> might<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.020> appropriate<00:01:46.140> now

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
body might be more appropriate now

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
body might be more appropriate now
that's<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> title<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.909> live<00:01:48.090> with

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
that's the title I could live with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's the title I could live with
so<00:01:49.170> having<00:01:49.590> sharp<00:01:49.920> tools<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> most

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so having sharp tools is the most

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
so having sharp tools is the most
important<00:01:51.030> element<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> wood<00:01:51.570> turning<00:01:51.890> when

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
important element of wood turning when

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
important element of wood turning when
they're<00:01:53.040> sharp<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:53.850> spent<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> lathe<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
they're sharp time spent on the lathe is

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
they're sharp time spent on the lathe is
just<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.350> rewarding<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.939> takes<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
just so rewarding it takes a lot of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.999 
just so rewarding it takes a lot of
practice<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.930> master<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.500> techniques<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
practice to master the techniques of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.069 
practice to master the techniques of
turning<00:01:59.369> once<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> desire<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
turning once you have the desire to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.460 
turning once you have the desire to
learn<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.640> good<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.470> you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
learn to be as good as you can be you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.759 
learn to be as good as you can be you
can<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.829> bring<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> later<00:02:05.430> life
