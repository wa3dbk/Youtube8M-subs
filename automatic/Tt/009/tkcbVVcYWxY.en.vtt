I<00:01:11.680> think<00:01:12.680> what<00:01:12.799> sets<00:01:13.130> reeds<00:01:13.460> apart<00:01:13.790> is

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
I think what sets reeds apart is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.969 
I think what sets reeds apart is
obviously<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.140> heritage<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
obviously that the heritage that the

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.039 
obviously that the heritage that the
university<00:01:16.460> brings<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:17.689> also<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
university brings with it but also the

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.200 
university brings with it but also the
fact<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.649> is<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> world-class<00:01:19.430> research

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
fact that it is a world-class research

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
develop I decided on Leeds because I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.039 
develop I decided on Leeds because I
reckoned<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.429> think<00:01:58.670> correctly<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.840> my

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
reckoned and I think correctly that my

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.660 
reckoned and I think correctly that my
own<00:02:00.200> development<00:02:00.890> academically<00:02:01.459> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
own development academically and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.570 
own development academically and
personally<00:02:01.850> would<00:02:02.720> benefit<00:02:03.319> much<00:02:03.619> more<00:02:03.950> from

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
personally would benefit much more from

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.359 
personally would benefit much more from
being<00:02:04.819> here<00:02:05.330> than<00:02:05.509> being<00:02:05.689> elsewhere<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.439> I

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
being here than being elsewhere and I

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.120 
being here than being elsewhere and I
still<00:02:07.939> think<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.299> that's<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:09.019> case<00:02:09.289> not

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
still think that that's the case not

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.430 
still think that that's the case not
just<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.670> my<00:02:10.849> part<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.660> university<00:02:12.230> but

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
just in my part of the university but

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
just in my part of the university but
across<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.010> institution<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.239> relationship

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
across the institution the relationship

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.920 
across the institution the relationship
between<00:02:15.850> Stafford<00:02:16.850> sales<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.420> very<00:02:17.690> very

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
between Stafford sales is very very

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.630 
between Stafford sales is very very
positive<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.590> certainly<00:02:19.130> work<00:02:19.280> with<00:02:19.489> all

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
positive and I certainly work with all

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.400 
positive and I certainly work with all
sorts<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.120> people<00:02:20.329> are<00:02:20.570> absolutely<00:02:21.079> critical

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
sorts of people are absolutely critical

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.729 
sorts of people are absolutely critical
to<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.400> mission<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.480> universities<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.500> get

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
to the mission of the universities I get

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:25.930 
to the mission of the universities I get
the<00:02:24.859> opportunity<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.400> work<00:02:25.519> with<00:02:25.700> industry

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the opportunity to work with industry

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.210 
the opportunity to work with industry
and<00:02:26.390> clinicians<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.470> obviously<00:02:28.040> the

and clinicians and obviously the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.890 
and clinicians and obviously the
outcomes<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.700> my<00:02:28.850> research<00:02:29.239> have<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> direct

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
outcomes of my research have a direct

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.990 
outcomes of my research have a direct
impact<00:02:30.049> on<00:02:30.470> patients<00:02:31.010> quite<00:02:31.280> quickly<00:02:31.549> I've

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
impact on patients quite quickly I've

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.759 
impact on patients quite quickly I've
had<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.209> lot<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.510> opportunity<00:02:33.109> particularly<00:02:33.590> in

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
had a lot of opportunity particularly in

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.199 
had a lot of opportunity particularly in
my<00:02:33.859> current<00:02:34.070> role<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.579> go<00:02:34.700> look<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.090> other

my current role to go look at other

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.360 
my current role to go look at other
universities<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.739> about<00:02:36.980> what<00:02:37.160> makes

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
universities and think about what makes

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.789 
universities and think about what makes
need<00:02:37.670> special<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.989> think<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.410> sense<00:02:39.620> of

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
need special and I think it's a sense of

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.490 
need special and I think it's a sense of
community<00:02:40.269> but<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.569> nine<00:02:41.870> faculties

this university and people are up for it
I've<00:03:14.400> certainly<00:03:14.730> found<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> university<00:03:15.630> to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
I've certainly found the university to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.199 
I've certainly found the university to
be<00:03:16.050> very<00:03:16.590> proactive<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.310> trying<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.700> create<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
be very proactive and trying to create a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.150 
be very proactive and trying to create a
culture<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.840> getting<00:03:19.590> everyone<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> work

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
culture of getting everyone to work

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.009 
culture of getting everyone to work
together<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.910> very<00:03:20.940> constructive<00:03:21.660> way<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.840> I

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
together in a very constructive way so I

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.330 
together in a very constructive way so I
think<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.349> something<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.709> takes<00:03:22.830> seriously

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
think it's something it takes seriously

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850 
think it's something it takes seriously
and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.330> realizes<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.349> value<00:03:25.709> of

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and I think it realizes the value of

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
and I think it realizes the value of
having<00:03:26.010> good<00:03:26.819> working<00:03:27.209> relationships<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.840> an

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
having good working relationships to an

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
having good working relationships to an
everyone<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:29.010> friendly<00:03:29.280> warm

cherish the staff and if you're
