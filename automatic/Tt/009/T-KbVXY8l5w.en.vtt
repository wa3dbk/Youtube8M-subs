seems like the drug the druid is like
the<00:02:00.729> snow<00:02:00.969> center<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.570> whole<00:02:01.750> thing<00:02:02.549> then

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
the snow center in this whole thing then

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.969 
the snow center in this whole thing then
I<00:02:03.579> just<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.090> way<00:02:04.210> he<00:02:04.420> moves<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.560> makes<00:02:05.860> it

I just the way he moves just makes it
looks<00:02:06.189> little<00:02:07.470> like<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> assassin<00:02:09.280> because

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
looks little like the assassin because

broadcaster

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.180 
broadcaster
but<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.910> figured<00:02:17.390> how<00:02:17.630> without<00:02:18.620> an<00:02:18.710> affinity

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
but I figured how without an affinity

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.460 
but I figured how without an affinity
here<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.330> infinite<00:02:20.810> Avery<00:02:21.170> where

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
here what kind of infinite Avery where

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.830 
here what kind of infinite Avery where
her<00:02:22.240> light<00:02:23.240> even<00:02:23.569> gonna<00:02:23.810> damage<00:02:25.540> let<00:02:26.540> him<00:02:26.690> go

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
her light even gonna damage let him go

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.300 
her light even gonna damage let him go
for<00:02:27.020> that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.699 

so<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.090> decided<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> druid<00:02:35.080> I've<00:02:35.530> done

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
so I just decided to a druid I've done

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.530 
so I just decided to a druid I've done
plenty<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.160> paladins<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.090> everything<00:02:37.420> like
