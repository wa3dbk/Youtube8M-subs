one thing is it's not 4k and also this

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
one thing is it's not 4k and also this
lens<00:01:30.570> amazing<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.430> slow

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
lens amazing but it's just a little slow

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.319 
lens amazing but it's just a little slow
to<00:01:32.850> hunt<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.750> focus<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> video<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.460> was

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to hunt for focus in video so I was

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
to hunt for focus in video so I was
looking<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.720> alternative<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:38.240> came<00:01:39.240> up

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
looking for an alternative and came up

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
looking for an alternative and came up
with<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> idea<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.020> give<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> sony<00:01:40.619> rx100<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
with the idea of give the sony rx100 so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.210 
with the idea of give the sony rx100 so
this<00:01:42.570> cam<00:01:42.840> isn't<00:01:43.020> beloved<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.649> youtubers

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.940 
this cam isn't beloved like youtubers
and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> mark<00:01:45.570> 3<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and I think the mark 3 is just want so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
and I think the mark 3 is just want so
many<00:01:47.070> awards<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> mark<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.390> came

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
many awards so the mark for just came
