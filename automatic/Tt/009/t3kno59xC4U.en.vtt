00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
you'll bend the pin in the middle but if

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.100 
you'll bend the pin in the middle but if
you<00:01:39.760> hit<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.270> very<00:01:40.600> lightly

you hit it very lightly
it'll<00:01:41.980> mushroom<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.850> end<00:01:43.090> which<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.780> what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
it'll mushroom out the end which is what

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.110 
it'll mushroom out the end which is what
we<00:01:44.080> want<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.920> I'm<00:01:48.100> painting<00:01:48.370> I'm<00:01:48.820> kind<00:01:49.060> of

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.030 
we want and as I'm painting I'm kind of
moving<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.570> around<00:01:49.690> pushing<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.590> metal<00:01:50.860> where

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
moving it around pushing the metal where

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.690 
moving it around pushing the metal where
I<00:01:51.100> want<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.430> so<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> nice<00:01:52.060> round<00:01:52.360> shape

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.160 

now<00:02:00.700> we'll<00:02:01.030> do<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.210> second<00:02:01.720> side<00:02:01.930> of<00:02:01.960> the

now we'll do the second side of the
hinge<00:02:02.440> end<00:02:03.060> again<00:02:04.060> I'll<00:02:04.270> use<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.450> piece<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.750> pin

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
hinge end again I'll use a piece of pin

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.950 
hinge end again I'll use a piece of pin
stock<00:02:05.380> it's<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.680> height<00:02:05.890> gauge<00:02:06.630> cut<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.780> off

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
stock it's a height gauge cut it off

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.320 
stock it's a height gauge cut it off
with<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.290> diagonal<00:02:08.860> pliers<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:13.320> then<00:02:14.320> use

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
with a diagonal pliers and then use

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:27.809 
with a diagonal pliers and then use
make<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.570> flat<00:02:15.780> again

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.670 

you're<00:02:28.090> on<00:02:28.239> here<00:02:28.749> and<00:02:29.079> I'm<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.409> to<00:02:29.439> start

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680

painting<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.120> second<00:02:37.569> side<00:02:37.780> I'm<00:02:38.079> going<00:02:38.260> to

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
painting this second side I'm going to

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.879 
painting this second side I'm going to
test<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.829> blade<00:02:39.069> see<00:02:39.459> how<00:02:39.519> tight<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:39.999> is<00:02:40.030> I

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.649 

find<00:02:44.889> it<00:02:45.040> better<00:02:45.189> to<00:02:45.340> kind<00:02:45.819> of<00:02:45.939> sneak<00:02:46.239> up<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
find it better to kind of sneak up and

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.140 
find it better to kind of sneak up and
get<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.049> blade<00:02:47.290> tight<00:02:47.620> slowly<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.670> opposed<00:02:49.060> to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
get the blade tight slowly as opposed to

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.629 
get the blade tight slowly as opposed to
getting<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.510> too<00:02:49.689> tight<00:02:49.930> start<00:02:50.319> out<00:02:50.439> with<00:02:53.639> so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
getting it too tight start out with so

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.309 
getting it too tight start out with so
I'll<00:02:54.849> pin<00:02:55.389> for<00:02:55.659> a<00:02:55.719> while

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
I'll pin for a while

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.890 
I'll pin for a while
test<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.980> blade<00:02:57.189> see<00:02:57.519> eye<00:02:57.549> opens<00:02:58.150> if<00:02:58.510> still

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
test the blade see eye opens if still

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500 
test the blade see eye opens if still
too<00:02:59.079> loose<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.530> being<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.889> little<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.159> and<00:03:00.639> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
too loose up being a little more and so

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:20.309 
too loose up being a little more and so
on<00:03:01.719> until<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.049> get<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.319> right<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.930> I'll<00:03:20.109> go<00:03:20.290> back

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
on until I get it right and I'll go back

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.750 
on until I get it right and I'll go back
