00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.030
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.260
 barvija here we are in a game in 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.430
 a house of monster hunter 4 ultimate and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.590
 let's go for a bus to now 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.770
 but first I'm preparing here a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.780
 I'm going to take a seed too 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:39.190
 of power and come there that we go for the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.690
 spoon I need some some 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.690
 materials to make your armor 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.630
 Nothing here we have our 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.410
 spoon that is walking calmly 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:55.980
 Through this desert he has decided to leave 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.880
 take a night walk and not expect 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 this 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.360
 and there are the hunters who come to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.250
 give him war the spoon would be thinking 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.050
 I'm so calm as here 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.150
 walking up and down to 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.390
 up and down come these to 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 annoy me 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.510
 the needy and the perfect ground we go 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.850
 to seize this moment 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.340
 as I always say these moments are the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.880
 that we have to take to launch 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 like hungry wolves or piranhas on 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.530
 the monsters that stay 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.800
 defenseless between quotes defenses between 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.800
 quotation marks 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.550
 there he was preparing 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.450
 come on come on 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.450
 teaspoon 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.420
 Well, there's a ride there 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 great let's get away and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.910
 I'll take the opportunity to sharpen the weapon and good 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.040
 here we have a subscriber making a 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.430
 little the funny set 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.920
 Nothing here is immortalized 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.740
 and all this riding has been 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.260
 completed successfully we use them 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.550
 our disposition for about 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.100
 a few seconds 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.300
 seconds and you know what to achieve in 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.380
 that second 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.380
 paste and paste 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.060
 visually I like I like this 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.160
 attack that uses the one that throws and the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.970
 air swirl 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.890
 that little tornado that moves through 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.220
 the battlefield we are going to launch a 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.660
 lucecita there we have it back to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.400
 soil and again we all go there not us 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.180
 we think about the events we 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.180
 we think twice 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.730
 Well, I think it leads well 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.730
 perfect ride 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.959
 because nothing will take advantage to give a 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.940
 back around here while the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.780
 cavalcade 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.780
 we wait patiently 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.270
 to finish successfully leaves 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.350
 to the ground and the hunters who throw themselves 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.350

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.920

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.370

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.340
 My thoughts that cross me like this 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.340
 fleetingly through the mind 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.540
 as I said at the beginning insurance 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.490

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.520
 go out to take the paseíllo 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:07.660
 he did not expect that they would throw themselves at him 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.660
 four hunters hungry for material 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.730
 Let's go there 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.270
 and there goes another ride 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.250
 Nothing to wait for it to end and 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.810
 Meanwhile now yes I will 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.810
 seize again to sharpen 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.479

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.589

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.860
 there is already dropped spoonful now at 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.150
 Jacuzzi for friends have fallen dead 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.180
 defeated 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.210
 at the feet of this group of tired 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.930
 it's good job guys very well done has 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.600
 been a very clean combat and has been 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.350
 very good and I take the opportunity to collect 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.630
 materials because good I need some 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.040
 little thing to finish doing your 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.880
 armor 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.090
 Well nothing has been my hunt today 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.490
 with the rest of fellow hunters 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.110
 I also pick up the tail that I do not know 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.520
 forget because it would not be the first time 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.700
 that I forgot to load the tail or there 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.070
 Sometimes the tail is so tiny that 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.360
 The ones located at 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.250
 end and you get nervous because you 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.490
 there is little good time but this is already 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.420
 other anecdotes of the game as always 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.820
