00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.580
 today I came to show you some 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.949
 I've done it by the way is a 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.050
 very small company of apothecary 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:27.140
 and I'm going to drop you, it 's actually people. 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.200
 I do not have apothecary here in germany but 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.620
 in portugal, I already knew that I had the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.430
 apothecary there but I did not know I had 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.980
 a person who sold from all over europe 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.620
 I was super happy because there was a 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030
 post a lipstick and I was crazy about 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.210
 lipstick 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 How do I do this? 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.340
 lipstick and then in the post was even a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.570
 a Portuguese woman and she told me 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.890
 person who is the media boat to confirm 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.659
 which is the media boat and she gets you into 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.970
 contact the facebook student I go 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.790
 leave her contact here and she will send 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.250
 To whole europe and I paid a freight 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.710
 of 3 a little bit without screening 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.170
 but I believe that if you want a 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.630
 tracking then you pay a little more 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.940
 expensive and you have the tracking code 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.520
 but as here in Europe there is not much 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.130
 problem with the mail then you do not have 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.060
 problem were tracking even arrived 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:38.750
 soon less than a week was 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:43.850
 less than a week was to become is the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.210
 she sends a catalog will bring the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:52.700
 March 2015 release 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.369
 and here you have a lot of cool stuff there 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.490
 if I want to ask I'll order and then 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:04.729
 When you get to her, nothing in this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.220
 Yes, he sent a box of 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.790
 apothecary which is a brush that I love and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.700
 I enjoyed and with 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.299
 the other was already 11 and this is my being 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.579
 I really like this brush to make the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.609
 line of eyelashes and also a 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.739
 eyeliner too thick and they 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.680
 They smoke too as you do and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.659
 outlined here in the lash line 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.260
 You give a chill they were super 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:37.980
 concrete why I like the spin sky 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.139
 three lipsticks two of the intense line and this 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.750
 It's intense too but I think the 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:46.079
 limited edition the intense be it to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.060
 urban was around because of that button 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:53.629
 that I was crazy 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.769
 I'll show you first I 343 and 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.629
 one thing also that I found superlegal 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.540
 that he has a solar factor and that 343 he is 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:11.639
 a little orange I found super 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:15.329
 1 2 3 gostosinho cute is a pinkish 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.720
 of course very beautiful too 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.159
 he is very dry the only thing I 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.120
 I did not like it very much 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.489
 it was the quality of this button that wins 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.989
 10 of 2015 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.180
 so I have less than a year to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.199
 use it and the others already have two years of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.909
 shelf life 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.629
 it was because of that button that I stayed 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:42.180
 crazy is the lovely pink and really 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:44.909
 people he sang then he went with that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.500
 understanding apothecary I loved the 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.209
 lipsticks in the brush I already knew and maybe I 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.530
