00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.060
 it never stops being impressive with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.060
 Romantics is the perfect complement 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.569
 yes it is under the sea 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.739
 finally that moment 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:15.700
 the bars 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.409
 for 100 less several tricks 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.679
 a group of 150 spaces congregate in a place 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.159
 that's when these prehistoric creatures appear 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:32.309
 they melt and reproduce so it was only once a year usually the moon 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.350
 full of it 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 between august and september 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 but julián 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.320
 baptized that way because it is the largest fish in the entire Atlantic Ocean 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.830
 can reach up to six feet in length 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.050
 stop until half a ton 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 and what is the relevance of this loving encounter 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.790
 cost life 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.690
 on those nights for decades 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.430
 the fishermen who unleashed massive massacres against the mere goliat 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.490
 until in the 80s 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.970
 almost all its extension then in 1990 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.770
 delivered the place one in general 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.410
 Miami United States 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 On the one hand hector azar has been studying retail for days 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.130
 last eight years 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.590
 ensures that this creature lived with the dinosaurs 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.040
 gone today is the only place in the world today on Thursday 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.290
 Alonso based more or less consistently 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.460
 all the year 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.610
 inclusive 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.380
 the day of the wall meeting 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.160
 hours before cold it submerged in the waters of the beach of Jupiter 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.640
 one of the points where today you can see 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.900
 the adult policemen 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.380
 because being young they survived the man's attack k by staying 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.920
 hidden during the first eight to ten years of his life 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.220
 level of the mangroves these structures that we see in points like in the cays of 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.560
 florida 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.880
 its roots are caves in which they grow until they reach maturity 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 from here in nigrán asier reef speed 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.050
 until at least 40 years 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.370
 then the day they mate 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.869
 during what would be the nuptial courtship between the male and the female 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.349
 voices as well as colors also clear to darker 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.230
 adults live associated with coral structures such as reefs 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.469
 natural and artificial 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.589
 It was like we saw it 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.409
 inside a sunken ship and although it seems incredible how they attack the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.269
 man 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.049
 the document does not like or 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.479
 I am against an initial underwater fishing 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.529
 or the museum 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.460
 eduardo gonzález and our cameraman clemency aunt 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.319
 we were approached by goliat 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.099
 and we understood that if they are not attacked they are peaceful 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.329
 read dates first active album 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.499
 week and they will want to defend themselves 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.639
 and it can lead to that he was dead 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.259
 besides overfishing 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.489
 his father tato juvenile the nursery of the red mangrove 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.199
 an accelerated pace is being destroyed 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.690
 for example the area that is now the Mariani accountant a century ago 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.650
 It was pure jungle robbery where this species inhabited before the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.689
 duchess 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.969
 today at the departure for divers' marriages they pay thousands of dollars to see it 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.589
 we also know well 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.759
 the camera Andrew Cambero has 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.159
 e a fairly high mercury content 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.539
 i have certain parasites 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.539
 the case has come, I could not pay 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.449
 lose your fishing equipment 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.479
 the ship 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.020
 it's an irony of this story 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.020
 it's like a romantic encounter under a full moon 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.259
 it almost meant the end of this species the mere goliat 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.379
 thanks to the federal moratorium we can continue to see this 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.860
 enigmatic men 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 in the performances given Americans we hope that not only us 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.029
 but also future generations especially in florida 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.509
 since informed the above 

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:56.789
