little<00:00:10.540> trick<00:00:11.170> with<00:00:11.350> the<00:00:11.440> gating<00:00:11.770> system<00:00:11.950> is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
little trick with the gating system is

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.840 
little trick with the gating system is
how<00:00:13.450> to<00:00:13.510> force<00:00:14.050> carbonate<00:00:14.530> your<00:00:14.680> beer<00:00:14.890> faster

how to force carbonate your beer faster

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.790 
how to force carbonate your beer faster
than<00:00:16.359> normal<00:00:16.600> so<00:00:17.019> let's<00:00:17.260> say<00:00:17.410> you've<00:00:17.590> got<00:00:17.619> a

weekend it's like two days away how do

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.580 
weekend it's like two days away how do
you<00:00:27.520> get<00:00:27.610> that<00:00:27.730> beer<00:00:27.970> carbonated<00:00:28.810> and<00:00:28.960> ready

normally the normal method is you look

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.059 
normally the normal method is you look
at<00:00:34.629> a<00:00:34.690> carbonation<00:00:35.260> table<00:00:35.589> based<00:00:35.800> on<00:00:35.920> your

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.069 
at a carbonation table based on your

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.639 
at a carbonation table based on your
temperature<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:37.030> how<00:00:37.179> much<00:00:37.589> carbonation<00:00:38.589> you

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
temperature and how much carbonation you

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.200 
temperature and how much carbonation you
want<00:00:38.769> to<00:00:38.829> have<00:00:38.979> in<00:00:39.129> it<00:00:39.249> and<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:39.760> set<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.179> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
want to have in it and you set to a

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.879 
want to have in it and you set to a
certain<00:00:40.510> psi<00:00:40.929> you<00:00:41.260> have<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.440> balance<00:00:41.620> that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:41.889 
certain psi you have to balance that

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.110 
certain psi you have to balance that
with<00:00:42.069> your<00:00:42.339> caking<00:00:42.609> system<00:00:42.879> which<00:00:42.969> we've

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
with your caking system which we've

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.790 
with your caking system which we've
talked<00:00:43.329> about<00:00:43.449> in<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.690> past<00:00:43.839> normally<00:00:44.710> that's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
talked about in the past normally that's

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.419 
talked about in the past normally that's
around<00:00:45.010> 12<00:00:45.339> psi<00:00:45.940> or<00:00:46.329> something<00:00:46.600> like<00:00:46.690> that

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
around 12 psi or something like that

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.750 
around 12 psi or something like that
that's<00:00:48.429> fine

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
that's fine

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.340 
that's fine
you've<00:00:48.969> got<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.179> beer<00:00:49.329> sit<00:00:49.569> for<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.839> week<00:00:50.109> or

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
you've got the beer sit for a week or

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.899 
you've got the beer sit for a week or
two<00:00:50.499> weeks<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.010> will<00:00:51.100> carbonate<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:51.850> it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
two weeks and it will carbonate and it

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.939 
two weeks and it will carbonate and it
carbonates<00:00:52.269> beautifully<00:00:53.109> that<00:00:53.260> way<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.739> when

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
carbonates beautifully that way and when

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.770 
carbonates beautifully that way and when
it's<00:00:54.100> done<00:00:54.249> car<00:00:54.489> ready<00:00:54.670> you're<00:00:55.239> at<00:00:55.389> serving

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
have here the way that this starts is

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.900 
have here the way that this starts is
you're<00:01:08.530> going<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.710> crank<00:01:08.980> up<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.340> pressure<00:01:09.610> on

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
you're going to crank up the pressure on

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.830 
you're going to crank up the pressure on
your<00:01:10.030> regulator<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:11.530> 20<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.580> 30<00:01:12.820> psi<00:01:13.060> whatever

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
your regulator to 20 to 30 psi whatever

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.270 
your regulator to 20 to 30 psi whatever
you're<00:01:13.960> comfortable<00:01:14.140> with<00:01:14.440> then<00:01:15.220> you're

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
you're comfortable with then you're

you're comfortable with then you're
going<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.520> shake<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.030> keg<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.510> you'll<00:01:16.660> hear

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
going to shake the keg and you'll hear

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.890 
going to shake the keg and you'll hear
gas<00:01:17.500> flowing<00:01:17.950> from<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.550> regulator<00:01:19.000> into<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
gas flowing from the regulator into the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.000 
gas flowing from the regulator into the
beer<00:01:20.260> as<00:01:20.440> you<00:01:20.980> shake<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.490> shake<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.850> shake<00:01:22.060> it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
beer as you shake and shake and shake it

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.290 
beer as you shake and shake and shake it
normally<00:01:24.010> I<00:01:24.040> do<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.670> couple<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.060> times

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
normally I do this a couple of times

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.000 
normally I do this a couple of times
I'll<00:01:25.450> shake<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.780> I'll<00:01:26.170> go<00:01:26.380> away<00:01:26.500> for<00:01:26.830> an<00:01:26.890> hour

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
I'll shake it I'll go away for an hour

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.030 
I'll shake it I'll go away for an hour
and<00:01:27.430> come<00:01:28.090> back<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.510> shake<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.750> some<00:01:29.020> more<00:01:29.200> go

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
and come back and shake it some more go

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.620 
and come back and shake it some more go
away<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.460> come<00:01:30.490> back<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:30.970> every<00:01:31.300> time<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.510> let

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
away and come back so every time you let

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.810 
away and come back so every time you let
it<00:01:31.720> sit<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.740> just<00:01:32.890> kind<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.160> shaking<00:01:33.460> up<00:01:33.670> a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it sit you just kind of shaking up a

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.520 
it sit you just kind of shaking up a
soda<00:01:34.150> or<00:01:34.390> something<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:34.780> got<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:34.960> let<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:35.200> sit

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
soda or something you got to let it sit

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.590 
soda or something you got to let it sit
before<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.980> before<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:36.970> carbonation<00:01:37.330> really

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
before it before the carbonation really

before it before the carbonation really
gets<00:01:38.050> in<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> beer<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.860> know<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.400> hear

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
gets in the beer you know you can hear

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.900 
gets in the beer you know you can hear
it<00:01:39.730> flowing<00:01:39.940> as<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.270> go<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:42.220> I<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.730> big

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
it flowing as you go but I the big

it flowing as you go but I the big
warning<00:01:43.180> with<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:43.870> very<00:01:43.930> easy<00:01:44.290> to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
warning with this is it's very easy to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.060 
warning with this is it's very easy to
over<00:01:44.980> carbonate<00:01:45.430> beer<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:47.290> like<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.860> kind<00:01:48.010> of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
over carbonate beer so I like to kind of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.270 
over carbonate beer so I like to kind of
go<00:01:48.220> slowly<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.730> usually<00:01:49.120> use<00:01:49.270> 20<00:01:49.690> psi<00:01:49.930> 25<00:01:50.680> psi<00:01:51.100> if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
go slowly I usually use 20 psi 25 psi if

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.590 
go slowly I usually use 20 psi 25 psi if
I'm<00:01:51.370> really<00:01:51.490> getting<00:01:51.730> anxious<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.300> want<00:01:52.540> to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
I'm really getting anxious and I want to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.780 
I'm really getting anxious and I want to
do<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.930> fast<00:01:53.140> but<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.280> let<00:01:54.370> me<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:54.550> show<00:01:54.700> you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
do it fast but so let me just show you

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.160 
do it fast but so let me just show you
the<00:01:54.880> basic<00:01:55.240> technique<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.810> then<00:01:55.900> we'll<00:01:56.020> talk

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
the basic technique and then we'll talk

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.530 
the basic technique and then we'll talk
about<00:01:56.290> over<00:01:56.590> carbon

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
about over carbon

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.070 
about over carbon
so<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.920> beer<00:02:00.100> has<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.460> be<00:02:00.580> cold<00:02:00.790> first<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.540> just

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
so the beer has to be cold first I just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.350 
so the beer has to be cold first I just
pulled<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.410> out<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.770> keg<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:04.090> can<00:02:04.240> see

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
pulled this out of the keg you can see

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.180 
pulled this out of the keg you can see
it's<00:02:04.510> sweating<00:02:04.900> here<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.350> hot<00:02:05.530> garage<00:02:05.860> so

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
it's sweating here in the hot garage so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.810 
it's sweating here in the hot garage so
the<00:02:06.760> keg<00:02:06.970> is<00:02:07.180> cold<00:02:07.450> beer<00:02:07.870> is<00:02:08.020> cold<00:02:08.760> what<00:02:09.760> I'm

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
the keg is cold beer is cold what I'm

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.700 
the keg is cold beer is cold what I'm
going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.970> do<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.240> I'm<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.360> gonna<00:02:10.600> take<00:02:11.560> my

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
going to do is I'm just gonna take my

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.350 
going to do is I'm just gonna take my
screwdriver<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.370> I'm<00:02:12.490> gonna<00:02:12.640> dial<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.120> up

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
screwdriver and I'm gonna dial this up

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.720 
screwdriver and I'm gonna dial this up
the<00:02:13.990> psi<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.590> my<00:02:14.710> regulator<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.400> little<00:02:15.520> bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the psi and my regulator up a little bit

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.020 
the psi and my regulator up a little bit
until<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.930> about<00:02:17.230> 20<00:02:17.890> psi<00:02:18.070> or<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.790> it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
until I get to about 20 psi or so it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.100 
until I get to about 20 psi or so it's
where<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.210> want<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.600> be<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.120> then<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.600> just

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
where I want it to be and then I just

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.910 
where I want it to be and then I just
simply<00:02:23.880> lean<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.060> over<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:25.960> this<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.500> just

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
simply lean it over like this and just

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.450 
simply lean it over like this and just
gently<00:02:27.760> shake<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.100> can't

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
gently shake it and you probably can't

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.600 
gently shake it and you probably can't
hear<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.820> but<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.110> co2<00:02:32.350> starts<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.160> flow<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
hear it but the co2 starts to flow in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.600 
hear it but the co2 starts to flow in
there<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:33.940> bit<00:02:34.980> thank<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.400> shake

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
there a little bit thank you just shake

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.680 
there a little bit thank you just shake
it<00:02:36.640> gently<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.300> let<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.510> go

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it gently like this and then let it go

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.970 
it gently like this and then let it go
and<00:02:42.180> come<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.600> bit<00:02:43.810> later<00:02:43.990> after

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and come back a little bit later after

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.430 
and come back a little bit later after
about<00:02:45.100> 10<00:02:45.370> 20<00:02:45.730> minutes<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.090> an<00:02:46.180> hour<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.810> shake

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
about 10 20 minutes or an hour and shake

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.850 
about 10 20 minutes or an hour and shake
it<00:02:47.470> some<00:02:47.740> more<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:50.260> keep<00:02:50.410> going<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
it some more and you just keep going the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.410 
it some more and you just keep going the
best<00:02:51.160> way<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.400> tell<00:02:51.730> how<00:02:51.970> well<00:02:52.000> your

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
best way to tell how well your

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
best way to tell how well your
carbonating<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.440> kind<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.680> taste<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.130> go

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
carbonating this kind of taste as you go

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.850 
carbonating this kind of taste as you go
so<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.610> do<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.090> hooked<00:02:55.209> up<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.770> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
so I do have it hooked up to the to the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.310 
so I do have it hooked up to the to the
kegerator<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.580> will<00:02:58.420> taste<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.080> take<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
kegerator I will taste so just take a

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.350 
kegerator I will taste so just take a
few<00:02:59.560> ounces<00:02:59.680> every<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.430> often<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.760> see<00:03:00.910> how<00:03:01.030> you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
few ounces every so often to see how you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.850 
few ounces every so often to see how you
will<00:03:01.420> seal<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.080> taste<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.470> carbonation

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
will seal it taste the carbonation

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.199 
will seal it taste the carbonation
coming<00:03:03.070> up<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:03.610> actually<00:03:03.850> interesting<00:03:03.970> way

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
coming up it's actually interesting way

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.400 
coming up it's actually interesting way
to<00:03:04.239> see<00:03:04.480> what<00:03:04.600> different<00:03:04.900> levels<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.170> co2

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
to see what different levels of co2

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.870 
to see what different levels of co2
taste<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:06.040> even<00:03:06.280> though<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.459> won't<00:03:06.580> really

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
taste like even though you won't really

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.520 
taste like even though you won't really
know<00:03:07.060> what<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.959> real<00:03:08.110> co2<00:03:08.560> level<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:10.530> like

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
know what the real co2 level is so like

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.720 
know what the real co2 level is so like
I<00:03:11.620> said<00:03:11.709> opposed<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.160> danger<00:03:12.520> with<00:03:12.640> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
I said opposed to the danger with this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.060 
I said opposed to the danger with this
method<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.150> over<00:03:13.450> carbonating<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:14.739> very

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
method is over carbonating and it's very

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.650 
method is over carbonating and it's very
easy<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.670> over<00:03:15.910> carbonate<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> beer

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
easy to over carbonate the beer

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.009 
easy to over carbonate the beer
especially<00:03:17.110> if<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.290> leave<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.680> 20<00:03:18.010> or<00:03:18.160> 30<00:03:18.400> psi

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
especially if you leave it 20 or 30 psi

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.090 
especially if you leave it 20 or 30 psi
overnight<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.230> come<00:03:20.440> back<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.980> you've

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
overnight and you come back and you've

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460 
overnight and you come back and you've
shaken<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.330> really<00:03:22.630> full<00:03:22.870> co2<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
shaken it and it's really full co2 the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.170 
shaken it and it's really full co2 the
only<00:03:23.860> way<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.070> get<00:03:24.250> around<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.910> points

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
only way to get around that that points

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.810 
only way to get around that that points
disconnect<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.959> gas<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:27.190> burp<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.610> cake

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
disconnect the gas and to burp the cake

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.300 
disconnect the gas and to burp the cake
completely<00:03:28.000> Burke<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.600> keg<00:03:28.840> with<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.950> poppet

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
completely Burke the keg with the poppet

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.790 
completely Burke the keg with the poppet
relief<00:03:30.550> valve<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.940> side<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.300> lid<00:03:31.800> and

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
relief valve in the side of the lid and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.830 
relief valve in the side of the lid and
then<00:03:33.280> again<00:03:33.730> taste<00:03:34.030> as<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.209> go<00:03:34.420> so<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.660> got

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
then again taste as you go so you got

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.830 
then again taste as you go so you got
the<00:03:34.959> burp<00:03:35.200> let<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.220> completely<00:03:37.180> depressurize

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
the burp let it completely depressurize

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.900 
the burp let it completely depressurize
and<00:03:38.110> more<00:03:38.410> gas<00:03:38.620> will<00:03:38.830> come<00:03:38.980> out<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.670> like

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
and more gas will come out just like

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.240 
and more gas will come out just like
cracking<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.989> top<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.500> bottle<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.860> soda<00:03:42.040> or

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
cracking the top of a bottle of soda or

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.130 
cracking the top of a bottle of soda or
a<00:03:42.340> beer<00:03:42.370> eventually<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.030> goes<00:03:43.180> flat<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
a beer eventually it goes flat so the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.020 
a beer eventually it goes flat so the
key<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.800> difficult<00:03:45.220> part<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.489> catching<00:03:45.940> it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
key the difficult part is catching it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.449 
key the difficult part is catching it
before<00:03:46.360> it's<00:03:46.480> flat<00:03:46.780> burping<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.739> there's<00:03:48.340> no

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
before it's flat burping and there's no

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.250 
before it's flat burping and there's no
good<00:03:48.670> science<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.150> burping<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.510> can't<00:03:49.720> sort

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
good science to burping you can't sort

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.830 
good science to burping you can't sort
of<00:03:50.320> do<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> half<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.190> burp<00:03:52.030> or<00:03:52.300> something<00:03:52.630> so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
of do a half of a burp or something so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.199 
of do a half of a burp or something so
just<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:53.890> this<00:03:54.340> method<00:03:54.519> isn't<00:03:54.880> my<00:03:54.940> favorite

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
just so this method isn't my favorite

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.729 
just so this method isn't my favorite
method<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> works<00:03:56.110> if<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.410> want<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.680> go

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
method but it works if you want to go

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.520 
method but it works if you want to go
fast<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:58.060> one<00:03:58.900> last<00:03:59.080> thing<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.260> want<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.440> talk

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
fast so one last thing I want to talk

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.720 
fast so one last thing I want to talk
about<00:03:59.650> with<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.860> shaking<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.310> another

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
about with the shaking that another

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.120 
about with the shaking that another
detriment<00:04:01.269> is<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.800> you're<00:04:02.800> not<00:04:02.920> going<00:04:03.070> to

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
detriment is that you're not going to

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.710 
detriment is that you're not going to
get<00:04:03.250> clear<00:04:03.519> beer<00:04:03.760> by<00:04:03.940> doing<00:04:04.239> this<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.510> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
get clear beer by doing this because it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.120 
get clear beer by doing this because it
takes<00:04:04.900> time<00:04:05.110> for<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.320> beer<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.620> settle<00:04:05.980> in<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
takes time for the beer to settle in the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.979 
takes time for the beer to settle in the
keg<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.549> when<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.180> are<00:04:07.329> shaking<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.810> anything

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
keg and when you are shaking it anything

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:08.879 
keg and when you are shaking it anything
that<00:04:08.079> has<00:04:08.320> settled

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
that has settled

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:09.900 
that has settled
comes<00:04:09.430> back<00:04:09.519> up

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
comes back up

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.780 
comes back up
okay<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:12.190> other<00:04:12.340> thing<00:04:12.490> you<00:04:12.580> need<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.730> be

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
okay the other thing you need to be

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.250 
okay the other thing you need to be
really<00:04:13.030> careful<00:04:13.180> about<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.750> before<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.200> start

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
really careful about is before you start

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.590 
really careful about is before you start
shaking<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.920> beer<00:04:15.220> make<00:04:15.850> sure<00:04:16.090> you've<00:04:16.239> purged

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
shaking a beer make sure you've purged

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.449 
shaking a beer make sure you've purged
all<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.110> oxygen<00:04:17.410> have<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.830> cake<00:04:18.010> that

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
all the oxygen have that cake that

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.340 
all the oxygen have that cake that
you've<00:04:18.580> burped<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.000> several<00:04:19.450> times<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.019> co2

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
you've burped it several times with co2

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.170 
you've burped it several times with co2
because<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.400> start<00:04:21.640> shaking<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:22.090> with

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
because if you start shaking it with

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
because if you start shaking it with
your<00:04:22.300> o2<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.810> there<00:04:22.930> you're<00:04:23.020> gonna<00:04:23.110> stale<00:04:23.920> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
your o2 in there you're gonna stale the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.480 
your o2 in there you're gonna stale the
beer<00:04:24.310> pretty<00:04:24.640> fast<00:04:24.910> as<00:04:25.180> well<00:04:26.310> those<00:04:27.310> are<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
beer pretty fast as well those are the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.040 
beer pretty fast as well those are the
main<00:04:27.640> things<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.030> look<00:04:28.120> out<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.540> when<00:04:28.900> you're

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
main things to look out for when you're

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.680 
main things to look out for when you're
doing<00:04:29.310> trying<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.370> wrap<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.760> carbonate<00:04:31.150> I've

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
doing trying to wrap it carbonate I've

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.420 
doing trying to wrap it carbonate I've
done<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.110> several<00:04:32.380> times<00:04:32.680> successfully<00:04:33.310> but

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
done it several times successfully but

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.340 
done it several times successfully but
it<00:04:33.580> probably<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.150> as<00:04:34.240> many<00:04:34.270> times<00:04:34.660> overshot

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
it probably just as many times overshot

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.380 
it probably just as many times overshot
it<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.680> had<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.860> add<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.760> burp<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.150> release

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
it and had to add to burp to release

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.870 
it and had to add to burp to release
pressure<00:04:37.600> so<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:39.370> how<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.550> wrap<00:04:39.760> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
pressure so that's how you wrap the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.970 
pressure so that's how you wrap the
carbonate<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:41.080> best<00:04:41.290> leg<00:04:41.440> thing<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.680> can<00:04:41.830> say

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
carbonate the best leg thing I can say

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.960 
carbonate the best leg thing I can say
is<00:04:42.130> good<00:04:42.370> luck<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:44.680> prefer<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.700> set<00:04:45.850> it

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
is good luck and I prefer this set it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.640 
is good luck and I prefer this set it
and<00:04:46.030> forget<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.330> method<00:04:46.690> but<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.230> is<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> way

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
and forget it method but this is the way

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.550 
and forget it method but this is the way
to<00:04:47.710> do<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.010> if<00:04:48.130> you<00:04:48.190> want<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.400> do<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.580> fast<00:04:48.790> so
