00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.550 
going to shoot all the green icons I can
and<00:01:46.690> try<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.020> points<00:01:47.500> up<00:01:48.210> hey<00:01:49.210> sorry<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
and try the points up hey sorry the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.080 
and try the points up hey sorry the
other<00:01:50.680> players<00:01:50.980> have<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.400> ability<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.700> shoot

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
other players have the ability to shoot

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.090 
other players have the ability to shoot
as<00:01:52.270> well<00:01:52.300> everybody<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.410> shooting<00:01:53.710> all<00:01:53.830> at<00:01:53.950> one

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
as well everybody is shooting all at one

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.820 
as well everybody is shooting all at one
time<00:01:54.130> because<00:01:54.730> if<00:01:55.420> if<00:01:55.900> Brook<00:01:56.230> for<00:01:56.470> example

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
time because if if Brook for example

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.110 
time because if if Brook for example
doesn't<00:01:57.010> like<00:01:57.250> science<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.820> she's<00:01:57.940> going<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
doesn't like science and she's going to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.640 
doesn't like science and she's going to
shoot<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.390> red<00:01:58.540> icons<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.020> keep<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.380> point

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
shoot the red icons to keep the point

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.940 
shoot the red icons to keep the point
stay<00:01:59.890> otherwise<00:02:01.320> otherwise<00:02:02.320> I'll<00:02:02.620> run<00:02:02.800> away

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
stay otherwise otherwise I'll run away

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.220 
stay otherwise otherwise I'll run away
with<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.160> score<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.120> answer<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:05.110> have

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
with the score so to answer this we have

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.050 
with the score so to answer this we have
to<00:02:05.350> press<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.830> button<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.400> raise<00:02:06.700> our<00:02:06.880> hand

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
to press the a button and raise our hand

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.220 
to press the a button and raise our hand
real<00:02:07.210> quick<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.570> we're<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.810> school<00:02:08.110> oh<00:02:10.230> you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
real quick like we're in school oh you

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.630 
real quick like we're in school oh you
know<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.500> notice<00:02:11.740> there<00:02:11.830> were<00:02:11.920> cards<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.550> you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
know I notice there were cards that you

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.310 
know I notice there were cards that you
get<00:02:12.790> sometimes<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.840> explain<00:02:14.080> those<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
get sometimes can you explain those a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.130 
get sometimes can you explain those a
little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.650> more<00:02:14.830> sure<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.840> can<00:02:16.960> see

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
little bit more sure and you can see

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
little bit more sure and you can see
here<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.560> Trudy<00:02:18.490> spins<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.530> cards<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.070> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
here as Trudy spins the cards are on the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.060 
here as Trudy spins the cards are on the
inside<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.060> wheel<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.680> they're

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
inside of the wheel there and they're

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.320 
inside of the wheel there and they're
kind<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.310> randomized<00:02:24.820> as<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.150> goes<00:02:25.300> through

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
kind of randomized as it goes through

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.790 
kind of randomized as it goes through
and<00:02:25.720> now<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.050> nudge<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.530> get<00:02:26.650> different

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
and now we can nudge to get different

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.770 
and now we can nudge to get different
cards<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.550> different<00:02:27.880> effects<00:02:28.150> this

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
cards that have different effects this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.570 
cards that have different effects this
one<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.230> example<00:02:29.260> now<00:02:29.800> Trudy<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.310> going<00:02:30.520> to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
one for example now Trudy is going to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.770 
one for example now Trudy is going to
have<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.820> do<00:02:30.940> what's<00:02:31.150> called<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> double

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
have to do what's called the double

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.830 
have to do what's called the double
points<00:02:32.170> dance<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.370> now<00:02:33.400> every<00:02:34.270> question<00:02:34.510> she

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
points dance and now every question she

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.050 
points dance and now every question she
gets<00:02:35.020> will<00:02:35.200> be<00:02:35.320> multiplied<00:02:35.890> based<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.880> how

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
gets will be multiplied based on how

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.670 
gets will be multiplied based on how
well<00:02:37.390> she<00:02:37.720> dances<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.260> we're<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> see

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
well she dances and we're going to see

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.030 
well she dances and we're going to see
her<00:02:38.800> do<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:40.050> if<00:02:41.050> she<00:02:41.380> does<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.830> tiny

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
her do that and if she does little tiny

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.170 
her do that and if she does little tiny
dancer<00:02:42.400> she's<00:02:42.580> not<00:02:42.730> going<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> very

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
dancer she's not going to get a very

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.060 
dancer she's not going to get a very
good<00:02:43.270> score<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:43.750> if<00:02:43.840> she<00:02:43.930> does<00:02:44.110> big<00:02:44.350> dances

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
good score but if she does big dances

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.350 
good score but if she does big dances
she's<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.580> big<00:02:45.640> score

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
she's going to get a big score

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
she's going to get a big score
how<00:02:48.080> does<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.350> exactly<00:02:48.620> measure<00:02:49.040> how<00:02:49.280> much<00:02:49.430> you

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
how does it exactly measure how much you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.360 
how does it exactly measure how much you
dance<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:52.090> come<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.180> Trudy<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.860> go<00:02:54.860> go<00:02:55.130> go

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
dance just come on Trudy get up go go go

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.210 
dance just come on Trudy get up go go go
nice<00:02:56.180> nice

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.670 

the<00:03:00.760> game<00:03:00.940> every<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.050> remote<00:03:02.350> has<00:03:02.560> an

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
the game every we remote has an

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.040 
the game every we remote has an
accelerometer<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.730> we've<00:03:04.630> done<00:03:04.810> some

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
accelerometer and so we've done some

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.880 
accelerometer and so we've done some
things<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.500> measure<00:03:05.740> how<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> accelerometer

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
things to measure how the accelerometer

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.810 
things to measure how the accelerometer
what<00:03:08.890> signals<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.370> coming<00:03:09.460> from<00:03:09.610> the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
what signals are coming from the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.880 
what signals are coming from the
accelerometer<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.630> we<00:03:11.260> know<00:03:11.440> because<00:03:11.710> we

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
accelerometer and we know because we

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.220 
accelerometer and we know because we
want<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.400> dancing<00:03:12.880> it'd<00:03:13.450> be<00:03:13.660> easy<00:03:13.870> for

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
want it to be dancing it'd be easy for

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.930 
want it to be dancing it'd be easy for
players<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.530> kind<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.920> kind<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.310> cheat<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.820> do

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
players to kind of kind of cheat and do

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.510 
players to kind of kind of cheat and do
a<00:03:15.970> little<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.570> quick<00:03:16.780> shake<00:03:17.050> like<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.520> so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
a little little quick shake like this so

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.610 
a little little quick shake like this so
we've<00:03:18.700> discounted<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.330> entirely<00:03:19.990> now<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
we've discounted that entirely now you

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.470 
we've discounted that entirely now you
have<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.100> all<00:03:21.340> sorts<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.820> different<00:03:21.880> things

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
have to do all sorts of different things

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.210 
have to do all sorts of different things
in<00:03:22.660> order<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.930> get<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> high<00:03:23.230> score<00:03:25.830> we<00:03:26.830> want<00:03:27.040> all

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
in order to get a high score we want all

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.980 
in order to get a high score we want all
of<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.520> players<00:03:27.700> interacting<00:03:28.360> all<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.780> time

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
of the players interacting all the time

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.660 
of the players interacting all the time
and<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.800> if<00:03:29.920> they're<00:03:30.070> standing<00:03:30.400> there<00:03:30.550> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
and so if they're standing there and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.520 
and so if they're standing there and
they're<00:03:30.760> dancing<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.330> you<00:03:31.660> know<00:03:31.750> dancing<00:03:32.020> and

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
they're dancing and you know dancing and

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.870 
they're dancing and you know dancing and
tugging<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:33.010> shaking<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.520> doing<00:03:33.730> all<00:03:33.850> sorts

really like shaking the wii remote or

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.570 
really like shaking the wii remote or
gesturing<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.900> throw<00:04:05.110> something<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.830> all<00:04:06.430> of

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
gesturing to throw something and all of

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.280 
gesturing to throw something and all of
the<00:04:06.700> games<00:04:06.910> all<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.450> popular<00:04:07.660> games<00:04:08.080> in

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the games all the popular games in

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.560 
the games all the popular games in
particular<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:08.830> mario<00:04:09.220> galaxy<00:04:09.400> right<00:04:09.880> they

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
particular like mario galaxy right they

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.380 
particular like mario galaxy right they
do<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:12.190> we<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.790> looked<00:04:13.060> at<00:04:13.180> ways<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
do that and so we we looked at ways to

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.870 
do that and so we we looked at ways to
kind<00:04:13.810> of<00:04:13.930> optimized<00:04:14.470> maximize<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.550> number<00:04:15.580> of

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
kind of optimized maximize the number of

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.400 
kind of optimized maximize the number of
times<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.269> do<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:16.900> think<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:17.200> came<00:04:17.380> up

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
times we do that and I think we came up

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.569 
times we do that and I think we came up
with<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:19.209> good<00:04:19.450> system

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
with a really good system

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.850 
with a really good system
so<00:04:21.120> do<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.299> get<00:04:21.389> ten<00:04:21.659> nudges<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.289> every<00:04:22.620> single

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
so do you get ten nudges on every single

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.740 
so do you get ten nudges on every single
time<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.490> spend<00:04:23.759> the<00:04:23.819> wheel<00:04:23.939> yes<00:04:24.300> every

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
time you spend the wheel yes every

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.540 
time you spend the wheel yes every
person<00:04:25.139> gets<00:04:25.289> ten<00:04:25.530> nudges<00:04:25.889> every<00:04:26.220> time<00:04:26.430> we

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
person gets ten nudges every time we

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360 
person gets ten nudges every time we
spin<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.909> wheel<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.979> way<00:04:29.129> it's<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
spin the wheel and that that way it's a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.719 
spin the wheel and that that way it's a
much<00:04:29.520> more<00:04:29.729> competitive<00:04:30.090> experience<00:04:31.729> what

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
much more competitive experience what

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.909 
much more competitive experience what
other<00:04:32.879> kinds<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.330> cards<00:04:33.629> are<00:04:33.719> there<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.710> are

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
other kinds of cards are there there are

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.589 
other kinds of cards are there there are
cards<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.550> let<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:35.879> try<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> steal<00:04:36.389> the

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
cards that let you try to steal the

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.600 
cards that let you try to steal the
question<00:04:36.960> from<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.289> other<00:04:37.379> player<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:38.460> a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
question from the other player it's a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.480 
question from the other player it's a
tug-of-war<00:04:38.819> card<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:40.590> so<00:04:41.129> you<00:04:41.189> don't

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
tug-of-war card and so you don't

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.159 
tug-of-war card and so you don't
automatically<00:04:42.090> steal<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.509> question<00:04:42.900> you

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
automatically steal the question you

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.959 
automatically steal the question you
just<00:04:43.199> have<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.650> tug<00:04:43.860> harder<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.580> longer<00:04:44.669> than

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
just have to tug harder and longer than

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.640 
just have to tug harder and longer than
anybody<00:04:45.180> else<00:04:45.479> then<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.080> other<00:04:46.199> person<00:04:46.560> is

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
anybody else then the other person is

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.619 
anybody else then the other person is
playing<00:04:46.919> in<00:04:47.669> order<00:04:47.879> to<00:04:47.939> steal<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.180> question

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
playing in order to steal the question

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.450 
playing in order to steal the question
there's<00:04:49.379> another<00:04:49.650> current<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.099> allows<00:04:50.310> you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
there's another current that allows you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.659 
there's another current that allows you
to<00:04:50.550> make<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.759> question<00:04:51.090> harder<00:04:51.509> and<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:53.580> have

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
to make the question harder and you have

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.450 
to make the question harder and you have
to<00:04:53.849> and<00:04:54.319> another<00:04:55.319> another<00:04:55.860> card<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.340> does

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
to and another another card that does

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.010 
to and another another card that does
the<00:04:56.610> opposite<00:04:57.030> makes<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> question<00:04:57.690> easier

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
the opposite makes the question easier

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.869 
the opposite makes the question easier
so<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.259> play<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.770> defensively<00:04:59.310> right

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
so you play that one defensively right

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.180 
so you play that one defensively right
to<00:05:00.000> try<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.210> make<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.419> easier<00:05:00.780> for<00:05:00.960> yourself

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
to try to make it easier for yourself

that stopped the timer so that you have

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.260 
that stopped the timer so that you have
more<00:05:08.460> time<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:08.879> answer<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.240> question

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.080 

let's<00:05:13.270> see<00:05:13.890> category<00:05:14.890> switcheroo<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.670> pulls

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
let's see category switcheroo that pulls

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.370 
let's see category switcheroo that pulls
up<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.420> shooting<00:05:16.750> gallery<00:05:17.080> but<00:05:17.230> four

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
up that shooting gallery but four

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.990 
up that shooting gallery but four
categories<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.100> you<00:05:18.160> shoot<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.520> category<00:05:18.910> you

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
categories so you shoot the category you
