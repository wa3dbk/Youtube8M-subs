 hello everyone is looking for how that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.020
 it's going to be okay 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.270
 so today we find ourselves in 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.059
 a video a little bit special him 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.640
 boxing duke boxing I always have a 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.989
 bad to say that assassin's word creed iv 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.309
 frankly that's something I can not wait 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.980
 that I waited for the case patience and 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.570
 finally I 'm going so here it's already a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.090
 beautiful box I am really 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.640
 happy to see it there is no doubt 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.290
 on it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.720
 second little things but could see at 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.950
 beginning of the video 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.780
 an introduction that is not mine 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.130
 happened on a community channel 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.739
 I simply think that all the 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.220
 world would have understood it well me 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.780
 say wow we will open them and secret that 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.700
 hold this box and wanted 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 present for you people who have 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.649
 could not buy it so that's how it was 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.569
 presents itself 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:13.600
 inside simply the figurine takes 

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:15.100
 a lot of room but I want my 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.729
 figurine we must climb but I you 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.719
 the watch is already mounted after then 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.149
 in it we can see the video I write it 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.649
 on ps3 personally because I know that 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.149
 I do not see the ps4 right now I 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:37.240
 am someone who likes to follow 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:41.880
 the game pretty quickly so two a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:46.479
 little steelbook magnet not bad at all 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 here I saw die we're going and so we 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.069
 can put to yield so sorry 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 if there is a small event I hit the 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.399
 microphone 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.350
 a second 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:07.670
 we have this mysterious envelope 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 envelope that contains two in the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.080
 textile card as door catches 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.060
 PO but where is white behind it 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.420
 do not know send them with a desert book 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.790
 above finally an art book of the boat and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:31.599
 edward quesnoy boat could see that 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.599
 me so here I have a mental envelope 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.010
 here is a year here the soundtrack of the game 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 anyone who wants to listen to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.720
 music while they play 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.760
 other games or just in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.269
 its bottom during hot nights 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:57.440
 with friends so we want it then we 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.209
 will be able to ship canvases too 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.470
 who are present in so black 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.620
 canouet canvases to hang on the wall 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 we could expose against a wall because 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.069
 that it changes a lot to what I said 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.090
 I feel how there I feel we 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.090
 must admit it then the boat 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.519
 here we can see the flag that will be 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.459
 open in the photos that will be all of 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.260
 following after the video showed parade is 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.260
 also present on the facebook page 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.680
 so and the vintage rogers that is not 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 in the pack but I still liked it 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.330
 to say to keep more suspense and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.180
 to make you profit a max dealer of the 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.720
 pack or the received more or less one or 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.840
 two months after ordering the pack 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.900
 to say I do not know how to tell you that 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.330
 to be even more impatient at this level 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.030
 there then we can have access to 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.670
 cards so use the treasure map 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.530
 to unlock the bonus content on 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.980
 pirate trophy we can have a 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.650
 disarming weapons and compass 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.780
 long views of the characters or even 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.430
 maybe some handlebars for the boat 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.220
 I saw exactly what it's called 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.140
 the character I'm not sure finally good 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.210
 it's digital content we up their 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.860
 one last time 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.620
 it looks like one last thing 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.530
 I did not see who had fallen to the bottom 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.850
 here I go it's the artbook at end I 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 think everyone knows what 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.970
 this is where to take them back from 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.680
 sketch from the beginning and put them in 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.479
 for everyone to see one that them 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:51.110
 what does it look like so we can see 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:56.780
 in the ark is what can be found there 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.010
 so that's when the sig that is 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.570
 unfortunately not in it but I'm going 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.280
 you come back anyway because she 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.600
 was to ride as I wanted at the beginning 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.600
 of the video so I think we actually 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.710
 then 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:25.360
 some are here so that's very very 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:29.879
 beautiful figurines really good to do 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:37.059
 hold or and spinners no fear 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:38.439
 it's not snakes very far their 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.099
 plastic and a ca I think all the 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.719
 world would have added 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.169
 she is 25 5 25 55 cm so a half 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.899
 metre 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.689
 it's not nothing it takes room m 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:53.229
 nice to watch 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:56.699
 when we go back to his room so here we go 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.699
 I wanted to show you something 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.099
 it's the map that's not the map 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.319
 really problem at that level I 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.699
 wanted to open 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:13.749
 here is here is what it takes in part if 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.059
 you do not want very well I am 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.579
 really sorry for that I can not 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:28.800
 still get me some excellent 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:33.490
 kindergarten select your cameras 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:38.169
 but that to come even all power me 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.409
 see no cubic if I can say that 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.409
 like that 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:46.479
 so here it was the end of his tubes 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:48.849
 boxing I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.009
 I hope not to implode me at that 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.099
 it's an assassin's creed origin this the 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.860
