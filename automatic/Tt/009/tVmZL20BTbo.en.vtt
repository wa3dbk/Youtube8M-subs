00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
down for you we'll start with the big

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
down for you we'll start with the big
one<00:00:34.440> graphics<00:00:35.160> how<00:00:35.460> does<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> look<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
one graphics how does it look well the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
one graphics how does it look well the
game<00:00:36.390> looks<00:00:36.600> great<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.989> both<00:00:37.020> systems<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
game looks great on both systems but it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.160 
game looks great on both systems but it
does<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.489> different<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.300> sort<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> hard<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
does look different it's sort of hard to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
does look different it's sort of hard to
pinpoint<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.980> these<00:00:41.340> games<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.879> different

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pinpoint how these games are different

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
pinpoint how these games are different
on<00:00:42.270> each<00:00:42.300> console<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.469> you've<00:00:43.860> played

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
on each console but if you've played

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
on each console but if you've played
them<00:00:44.340> both<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.059> long<00:00:45.210> time<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
them both for a very long time which I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260 
them both for a very long time which I
have<00:00:46.320> you'll<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> PlayStation<00:00:47.730> 3<00:00:47.969> has

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
have you'll see the PlayStation 3 has

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.150 
have you'll see the PlayStation 3 has
maybe<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.809> few<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.140> aliasing<00:00:49.739> passes

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
maybe a few more aliasing passes

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
maybe a few more aliasing passes
anti-aliasing<00:00:50.700> passes<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.239> things<00:00:51.690> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
anti-aliasing passes so things just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
anti-aliasing passes so things just
generally<00:00:52.199> look<00:00:52.230> smoother<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.160> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
generally look smoother on it it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.889 
generally look smoother on it it's
something<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.030> only<00:00:54.329> notice<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.809> you're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
something that you only notice if you're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
something that you only notice if you're
looking<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> side-by-side<00:00:55.559> screen<00:00:56.340> by

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
looking at it side-by-side screen by

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
looking at it side-by-side screen by
screen<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.629> actually<00:00:57.930> noticeable

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
screen but it is actually noticeable

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
screen but it is actually noticeable
also<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> playstation<00:00:59.850> 3<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.300> runs<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
also the playstation 3 just runs a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
also the playstation 3 just runs a
little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.170> better<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> general<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
little bit better in general and this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
little bit better in general and this is
probably<00:01:02.760> due<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> fact<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
probably due to the fact that a lot of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.780 
probably due to the fact that a lot of
the<00:01:04.559> game<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> stored<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> hard<00:01:05.430> drive

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the game is stored on the hard drive

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789 
the game is stored on the hard drive
there's<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.290> seven<00:01:07.650> minute

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
there's actually about a seven minute

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
there's actually about a seven minute
and<00:01:07.979> 45<00:01:08.220> seconds<00:01:08.640> install<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.210> first

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and 45 seconds install when you first

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
and 45 seconds install when you first
boot<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> playstation<00:01:10.380> 3<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
boot it up on playstation 3 and so this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.500 
boot it up on playstation 3 and so this
allows<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> access<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> info<00:01:12.270> pretty

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
allows it to access the info pretty

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
allows it to access the info pretty
quickly<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> talk<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:13.799> loading

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
quickly so when you talk about loading

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.980 
quickly so when you talk about loading
times<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.760> grand<00:01:14.939> theft<00:01:15.000> auto<00:01:15.240> 4<00:01:15.600> you're

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
times in grand theft auto 4 you're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
times in grand theft auto 4 you're
really<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.380> talking<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:16.799> any<00:01:17.070> time<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.580> all

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
really not talking about any time at all

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
really not talking about any time at all
for<00:01:17.790> any<00:01:18.060> given<00:01:18.390> mission<00:01:18.689> maybe<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.439> short

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
for any given mission maybe a short

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.140 
for any given mission maybe a short
loading<00:01:20.130> time<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> start<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> game

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
loading time when you start up the game

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
loading time when you start up the game
and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:22.200> after<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.340> talking

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and then after that you're just talking

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
and then after that you're just talking
about<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> few<00:01:24.150> seconds<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> air<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
about a few seconds here in the air so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
about a few seconds here in the air so
if<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.070> differences<00:01:26.460> which<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.820> are

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
if there are differences which there are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
if there are differences which there are
and<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.600> playstation<00:01:28.049> 3<00:01:28.170> loads<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.650> bit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and the playstation 3 loads a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
and the playstation 3 loads a little bit
faster<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.310> areas<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.570> only

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
faster in these areas you know it's only

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
faster in these areas you know it's only
one<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.170> two<00:01:31.200> seconds<00:01:31.799> maybe<00:01:32.009> three<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.369> four

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
one or two seconds maybe three or four

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
one or two seconds maybe three or four
seconds<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.720> hardly<00:01:34.049> affects<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
seconds but it hardly affects the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
seconds but it hardly affects the
gameplay<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.630> however<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> want<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gameplay at all however if you want to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.569

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
put a stop watch to it there you have it

the playstation 3 has a slight advantage

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.679 
the playstation 3 has a slight advantage
there<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.880> brightness<00:01:42.180> contrast

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
there things like brightness contrast

different<00:01:45.329> both<00:01:45.450> systems<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> could<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.100> wrong

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
different both systems I could be wrong

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
different both systems I could be wrong
but<00:01:47.670> according<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> me<00:01:48.570> according<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> Hillary

the<00:01:50.939> game<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.299> 360<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.200> looks<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.409> little<00:01:52.530> bit

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the game the 360 just looks a little bit

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
the game the 360 just looks a little bit
brighter<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.130> looks<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> colors<00:01:53.759> are<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
brighter it looks like the colors are a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420 
brighter it looks like the colors are a
little<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.390> vibrant<00:01:55.049> maybe<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
little bit more vibrant maybe but it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.560 
little bit more vibrant maybe but it
doesn't<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.759> give<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> an<00:01:57.060> edge<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> say

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
doesn't really give it an edge to say

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.149 
doesn't really give it an edge to say
that's<00:01:57.719> better<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.049> worse<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.890> should

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that's better or worse and I should

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.679 
that's better or worse and I should
mention<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.520> things<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.360> brightness

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
mention that things like brightness

and<00:02:46.630> off<00:02:47.050> separately<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.770> say<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.130> want

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and off separately so say you just want

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.880 
and off separately so say you just want
to<00:02:48.430> use<00:02:48.610> six<00:02:49.030> axis<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> bike<00:02:49.690> well<00:02:50.350> go

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
to use six axis for the bike well go

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.020 
to use six axis for the bike well go
ahead<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.610> turn<00:02:51.790> everything

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
ahead you can do that turn everything

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.280 
ahead you can do that turn everything
else<00:02:52.239> off<00:02:52.390> enough<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.690> worry<00:02:52.870> about<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.200> I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
else off enough to worry about it I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.360 
else off enough to worry about it I
should<00:02:53.470> also<00:02:53.530> mention<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.100> can<00:02:54.220> use<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
should also mention that you can use it

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.630 
should also mention that you can use it
for<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.820> auto<00:02:55.030> pitch<00:02:55.360> calibration<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:57.130> how

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
for the auto pitch calibration now how

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.770 
for the auto pitch calibration now how
does<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.940> work<00:02:58.060> for<00:02:58.270> each<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.450> these<00:02:58.570> things

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
does it work for each of these things

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.150 
does it work for each of these things
the<00:02:59.110> helicopter<00:02:59.590> actually<00:02:59.920> works<00:03:00.070> really

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the helicopter actually works really

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460 
the helicopter actually works really
well<00:03:00.540> you're<00:03:01.540> able<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> steer<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.290> easier

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
well you're able to steer a lot easier

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.260 
well you're able to steer a lot easier
it<00:03:02.680> kind<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.890> feels<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.790> should<00:03:04.000> be<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
it kind of feels like it should be the

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.210 
it kind of feels like it should be the
way<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.390> control<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.870> helicopter<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
way you control the helicopter but I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.680 
way you control the helicopter but I
should<00:03:06.489> also<00:03:06.610> mention<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.239> every<00:03:07.480> case

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
should also mention that in every case

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.330 
should also mention that in every case
where<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.080> have<00:03:08.170> six<00:03:08.530> access<00:03:08.800> control<00:03:09.130> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
where you have six access control you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.860 
where you have six access control you
also<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> normal<00:03:10.239> controls<00:03:10.600> turn<00:03:10.750> out

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
also have the normal controls turn out

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.540 
also have the normal controls turn out
the<00:03:10.989> same<00:03:11.110> time<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:11.560> if<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.100> held<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
the same time so if you just held the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.640 
the same time so if you just held the
ps3<00:03:12.970> controller<00:03:13.330> flat<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.020> decided<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.560> use

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
ps3 controller flat and decided to use

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.110 
ps3 controller flat and decided to use
the<00:03:14.709> analog<00:03:14.860> sticks<00:03:15.340> or<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.790> triggers

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
the analog sticks or the triggers

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.280 
the analog sticks or the triggers
whatever<00:03:16.450> you're<00:03:16.600> using<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.870> control<00:03:17.020> each

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
whatever you're using to control each

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.229 
whatever you're using to control each
vehicle<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.940> can't<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.209> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
vehicle you can so you can't have a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.090 
vehicle you can so you can't have a
combination<00:03:19.810> which<00:03:19.989> means<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.799> know

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
combination which means that you know

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.440 
combination which means that you know
you'll<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.400> write<00:03:21.610> rely<00:03:21.970> completely<00:03:22.030> on

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
you'll have to write rely completely on

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.789 
you'll have to write rely completely on
the<00:03:22.630> motion<00:03:22.780> controls<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.470> course<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.709> can

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the motion controls of course you can

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.810 
the motion controls of course you can
just<00:03:23.950> turn<00:03:24.010> them<00:03:24.160> off<00:03:24.250> completely<00:03:24.340> as<00:03:24.670> well

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
just turn them off completely as well

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.030 
just turn them off completely as well
like<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.090> said<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.900> bike<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:26.920> bit

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
like I said the bike it's a little bit

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.500 
like I said the bike it's a little bit
crazy<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.549> feels<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.970> little<00:03:28.090> bit<00:03:28.269> like<00:03:28.390> you're

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
crazy it feels a little bit like you're

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.090 
crazy it feels a little bit like you're
driving<00:03:28.810> drunk<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.230> wouldn't<00:03:29.500> recommend<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.950> I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
driving drunk I wouldn't recommend it I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.320 
driving drunk I wouldn't recommend it I
crashed<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.700> killed<00:03:30.760> myself<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.180> few<00:03:31.269> times

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
crashed and killed myself a few times

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.630 
crashed and killed myself a few times
when<00:03:31.600> i<00:03:31.630> did<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.260> boat<00:03:32.500> feels<00:03:32.799> fine<00:03:33.070> it's<00:03:33.459> not

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
when i did the boat feels fine it's not

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.550 
when i did the boat feels fine it's not
that<00:03:33.790> sensitive<00:03:34.060> anyways<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.440> other

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
that sensitive anyways and the other

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.990 
that sensitive anyways and the other
things<00:03:35.769> like<00:03:35.950> reload<00:03:36.280> well<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.850> know<00:03:36.940> you

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
things like reload well you know you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.460 
things like reload well you know you
auto<00:03:37.239> reload<00:03:37.480> if<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.780> keep<00:03:37.900> firing<00:03:38.170> anyways

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
auto reload if you keep firing anyways

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.860 
auto reload if you keep firing anyways
so<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.459> kind<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.730> cool<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.150> shake<00:03:40.570> control

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
so it is kind of cool to shake control

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.120 
so it is kind of cool to shake control
up<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.140> down<00:03:41.260> when<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.470> reload<00:03:41.680> your<00:03:41.739> weapon

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
up and down when you reload your weapon

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.160 
up and down when you reload your weapon
but<00:03:42.340> it's<00:03:43.090> just<00:03:43.390> sort<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.570> an<00:03:43.690> extra<00:03:44.049> I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
but it's just sort of an extra I

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.780 
but it's just sort of an extra I
wouldn't<00:03:44.530> say<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:44.950> makes<00:03:45.100> anything<00:03:45.370> that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
wouldn't say that it makes anything that

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.300 
wouldn't say that it makes anything that
much<00:03:46.000> better<00:03:46.530> next<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:47.650> have<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.860> analog

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
much better next we have the analog

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.979 
much better next we have the analog
sensitivity<00:03:48.910> now<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.060> found<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.660> analog

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
sensitivity now I found the analog

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.840 
sensitivity now I found the analog
sticks<00:03:50.260> for<00:03:50.530> driving<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.040> little<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.519> easier

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
sticks for driving a little bit easier

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.210 
sticks for driving a little bit easier
on<00:03:51.910> playstation<00:03:52.600> 3<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:52.959> I've<00:03:53.590> spent<00:03:53.920> less

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
on playstation 3 and I've spent less

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.310 
on playstation 3 and I've spent less
time<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:54.670> ps3<00:03:54.940> than<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.269> did<00:03:55.390> with<00:03:55.450> 360<00:03:55.930> since<00:03:56.200> i

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
time on ps3 than I did with 360 since i

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.860 
time on ps3 than I did with 360 since i
played<00:03:56.590> through<00:03:56.799> originally<00:03:57.580> on<00:03:57.700> 360<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.420> i

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
played through originally on 360 and i

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.420 
played through originally on 360 and i
still<00:03:59.110> thought<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.560> driving<00:04:00.010> was<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.190> little

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
still thought that driving was a little

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
still thought that driving was a little
bit<00:04:00.519> easier<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.910> playstation<00:04:01.299> 3

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
bit easier on the playstation 3

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.330 
bit easier on the playstation 3
controller<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.470> again<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.980> personal

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
controller but that again is a personal

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.820 
controller but that again is a personal
preference<00:04:03.989> next<00:04:04.989> we<00:04:05.110> have<00:04:05.230> aiming<00:04:05.620> now<00:04:05.769> the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
preference next we have aiming now the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.009

auto lock-on system in grand theft auto
4<00:04:08.290> which<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:08.920> turn<00:04:09.100> off<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.459> you'd<00:04:09.579> like

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
4 which you can turn off if you'd like

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.520 
4 which you can turn off if you'd like
to<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.180> isn't<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.420> huge<00:04:10.510> deal<00:04:10.600> either<00:04:10.930> as

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
to so this isn't a huge deal either as

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.100 
to so this isn't a huge deal either as
you<00:04:11.799> push<00:04:12.250> down<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.150> triggers<00:04:13.540> or<00:04:13.810> the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
you push down one of the triggers or the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.409 
you push down one of the triggers or the

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.539 
trigger on the ps3 controller or 360
controller<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:17.079> either<00:04:17.470> lock<00:04:17.890> on<00:04:18.100> or<00:04:18.280> somebody

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
controller to either lock on or somebody

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.650 
controller to either lock on or somebody
or<00:04:18.669> if<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:18.790> put<00:04:18.940> it<00:04:19.030> down<00:04:19.060> halfway<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:19.540> go

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
or if you put it down halfway you go

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.320 
or if you put it down halfway you go
into<00:04:19.810> free<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> mode<00:04:20.290> so<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:21.370> all<00:04:21.760> about<00:04:21.940> how

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
into free a mode so it is all about how

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.850 
into free a mode so it is all about how
much<00:04:22.630> distance<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.289> have<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.530> push<00:04:23.650> down<00:04:23.680> the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
much distance you have to push down the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.710 
much distance you have to push down the
controller<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.760> change<00:04:25.030> how<00:04:25.240> you're<00:04:25.419> aiming

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
controller to change how you're aiming

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.150 
controller to change how you're aiming
now<00:04:26.200> you'll<00:04:26.530> notice<00:04:26.770> that

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
now you'll notice that

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160 
now you'll notice that
on<00:04:27.280> ps3<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:28.180> don't<00:04:28.420> have<00:04:28.570> as<00:04:28.690> much<00:04:28.810> room<00:04:29.110> to

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
on ps3 you don't have as much room to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.500 
on ps3 you don't have as much room to
move<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.800> trigger<00:04:30.100> down<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.910> there's<00:04:31.420> a

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
move that trigger down so there's a

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.660 
move that trigger down so there's a
little<00:04:31.750> bit<00:04:32.020> more<00:04:32.320> sensitivity<00:04:32.980> involved

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
little bit more sensitivity involved

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.830 
little bit more sensitivity involved
when<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:33.940> want<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.180> go<00:04:34.240> into<00:04:34.390> free<00:04:34.630> mode

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
when you want to go into free mode

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.870 
when you want to go into free mode
opposed<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.010> when<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.250> are<00:04:36.340> actually<00:04:36.520> locking

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
opposed to when you are actually locking

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.700 
opposed to when you are actually locking
onto<00:04:37.090> someone<00:04:37.450> i<00:04:37.600> found<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.410> little<00:04:38.440> bit

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
onto someone i found it a little bit

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.160 
onto someone i found it a little bit
easier<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.520> judge<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.300> distance<00:04:40.750> between

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
easier to judge this distance between

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.080 
easier to judge this distance between
the<00:04:41.380> trigger<00:04:41.620> depression<00:04:42.130> on<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.670> 360

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090

the trigger depression on the 360
controller<00:04:43.480> but<00:04:43.930> concerning<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.920> huge

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.910 
was able to get used to on ps3 almost

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
immediately so that is a difference
