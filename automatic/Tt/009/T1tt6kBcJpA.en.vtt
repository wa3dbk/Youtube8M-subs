being you know locking hub mechanism the
bolts<00:01:24.729> on<00:01:24.880> there's<00:01:25.840> actually<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:28.060> this

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
bolts on there's actually this this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.840 
bolts on there's actually this this
metal<00:01:29.110> gear<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.530> goes<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.160> go<00:01:30.550> that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
metal gear that goes in that go that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.460 
metal gear that goes in that go that
axle<00:01:31.150> goes<00:01:31.270> into<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.660> then<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.930> outer<00:01:32.110> gear<00:01:32.350> is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
axle goes into it then the outer gear is

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.350 
axle goes into it then the outer gear is
going<00:01:33.070> up<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.220> want<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.490> just<00:01:36.759> pop<00:01:37.119> them

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
going up so if I want to just pop them

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.330 
going up so if I want to just pop them
out<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.840> look<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.680> c-clip<00:01:39.070> on<00:01:39.190> each

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
out so you look to for a c-clip on each

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.540 
out so you look to for a c-clip on each
side<00:01:39.580> holds<00:01:39.880> them<00:01:39.970> in<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.479> then<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:40.780> could<00:01:41.550> have

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
side holds them in and then I could have

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.460 
side holds them in and then I could have
a<00:01:42.610> free<00:01:42.850> front<00:01:43.540> axle<00:01:43.899> for<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.110> better<00:01:44.229> fuel

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
a free front axle for a better fuel

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.060 
a free front axle for a better fuel
mileage<00:01:45.960> yeah<00:01:46.960> yeah<00:01:47.110> thanks<00:01:47.560> pretty

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
slant-6 that you can put in four-wheel

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.219 
slant-6 that you can put in four-wheel
drive<00:01:54.869> low<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:56.869> obviously<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
drive low and then obviously the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
drive low and then obviously the

see like the bumpers dented in and the
whole<00:03:10.810> truck<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.290> stiff<00:03:11.500> flow<00:03:11.710> which<00:03:12.190> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
whole truck just stiff flow which is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.590 
whole truck just stiff flow which is
partially<00:03:12.670> because<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.970> ball<00:03:13.120> dropped<00:03:13.390> but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
partially because the ball dropped but

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.730 
partially because the ball dropped but
it's<00:03:14.170> also<00:03:14.350> cause<00:03:14.710> of<00:03:14.830> leaf<00:03:14.980> spring<00:03:16.650> hard<00:03:17.650> to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
it's also cause of leaf spring hard to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's also cause of leaf spring hard to
see<00:03:17.920> with<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.130> light<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:21.420> 3.7<00:03:22.420> liter<00:03:22.630> 2<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.440> 5

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
it's a one barrel of course and it would

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.449 
it's a one barrel of course and it would
barely<00:03:30.400> move<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:32.380> was<00:03:32.560> was<00:03:33.100> pretty

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
this old one barrel two to five I think

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.339 
this old one barrel two to five I think
wikipedia<00:06:42.229> says<00:06:42.289> these<00:06:42.650> things<00:06:42.919> are<00:06:43.189> like<00:06:44.349> 97

horsepower<00:06:45.770> I<00:06:45.889> don't<00:06:46.069> know<00:06:46.159> how<00:06:46.280> true<00:06:46.490> that<00:06:46.520> is

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
horsepower I don't know how true that is

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.499 
horsepower I don't know how true that is
I'm<00:06:48.770> a<00:06:48.830> book<00:06:49.189> in<00:06:49.310> my<00:06:49.340> room<00:06:49.430> for<00:06:49.969> the<00:06:50.030> trucks<00:06:50.300> and

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:50.509 
I'm a book in my room for the trucks and

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.839 
I'm a book in my room for the trucks and
it<00:06:50.629> says<00:06:50.870> they're<00:06:51.379> 150<00:06:51.919> horsepower<00:06:52.370> which<00:06:52.729> I

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
it says they're 150 horsepower which I

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.879 
it says they're 150 horsepower which I
really<00:06:53.539> doubt<00:06:54.699> for<00:06:55.699> these<00:06:55.849> years<00:06:56.680> like<00:06:57.680> I<00:06:57.830> know

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
really doubt for these years like I know

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.369 
really doubt for these years like I know
the<00:06:58.129> the<00:06:58.460> darts<00:06:58.819> were<00:06:58.939> 145<00:06:59.719> horsepower<00:06:59.930> with

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379 
the the darts were 145 horsepower with

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.360 
the the darts were 145 horsepower with
the<00:07:00.409> 225<00:07:00.979> back<00:07:01.460> in<00:07:01.639> 65<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:03.620> that's<00:07:03.860> that's

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
the 225 back in 65 and that's that's

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.300 
the 225 back in 65 and that's that's
pretty<00:07:05.469> you<00:07:06.469> know<00:07:06.590> there's<00:07:06.770> no<00:07:06.889> emissions

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
pretty you know there's no emissions

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.059 
pretty you know there's no emissions
 and<00:07:08.259> engines<00:07:09.259> back<00:07:09.440> then<00:07:09.620> put<00:07:09.800> out<00:07:09.919> more

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
 and engines back then put out more

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.140 
 and engines back then put out more
power<00:07:10.310> they<00:07:10.580> were<00:07:10.639> slightly<00:07:11.000> higher

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
power they were slightly higher

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.320 
power they were slightly higher
compression<00:07:11.539> and<00:07:12.340> but<00:07:13.340> I<00:07:13.669> think<00:07:14.180> yeah

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
compression and but I think yeah

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.230 
compression and but I think yeah
enough<00:07:14.840> power<00:07:15.080> for<00:07:15.259> me

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:30.590

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.740 
it it's a definitely like a speed demon
compared<00:07:41.830> to<00:07:41.950> this<00:07:42.100> thing<00:07:42.370> it's<00:07:43.240> a<00:07:43.390> two<00:07:43.540> barrel

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:43.750 
compared to this thing it's a two barrel

compared to this thing it's a two barrel
I<00:07:43.900> don't<00:07:44.050> know<00:07:44.110> how<00:07:44.230> much<00:07:44.320> more<00:07:44.470> power<00:07:44.740> it

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
I don't know how much more power it

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.530 
I don't know how much more power it
gives<00:07:44.980> it<00:07:45.220> but<00:07:47.010> it's<00:07:48.010> just<00:07:48.400> crazy<00:07:48.640> how<00:07:49.000> much

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:49.540 
gives it but it's just crazy how much
