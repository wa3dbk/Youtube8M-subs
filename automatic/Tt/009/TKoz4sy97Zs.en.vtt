00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.400 
answers they do seek to see the bigger
in<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.950> smaller<00:01:16.310> or<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:17.180> smaller<00:01:17.510> in<00:01:17.930> the

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
in the smaller or the smaller in the

in the smaller or the smaller in the
bigger<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.840> downside<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:21.560> Sagittarius

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
bigger and the downside with Sagittarius

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
bigger and the downside with Sagittarius
is<00:01:22.520> well<00:01:24.130> sometimes<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.430> Sagittarian

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
is well sometimes the Sagittarian

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.830 
is well sometimes the Sagittarian
personalities<00:01:27.050> sowed<00:01:27.410> idealistic<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.570> so

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
personalities sowed idealistic and is so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.750 
personalities sowed idealistic and is so
kind<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.230> out<00:01:30.440> there<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.220> they're<00:01:31.370> kind<00:01:31.610> of

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
kind of out there that they're kind of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.790 
kind of out there that they're kind of
almost<00:01:32.030> not<00:01:32.480> properly<00:01:32.870> in<00:01:33.050> their<00:01:33.170> body<00:01:33.440> so

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
almost not properly in their body so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.100 
almost not properly in their body so
actually<00:01:34.340> Sagittarians<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:35.870> quite

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
actually Sagittarians can be quite

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.470 
actually Sagittarians can be quite
clumsy<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.860> little<00:01:37.190> bit<00:01:37.310> accident-prone<00:01:37.970> I

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
clumsy a little bit accident-prone I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.800 
clumsy a little bit accident-prone I
mean<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.750> goes<00:01:39.020> with<00:01:39.350> Aries<00:01:40.250> as<00:01:40.490> well<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
mean this goes with Aries as well the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.380 
mean this goes with Aries as well the
other<00:01:42.020> fire<00:01:42.350> sign<00:01:43.010> one<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.000> other<00:01:44.120> fire

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
other fire sign one of the other fire

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.320 
other fire sign one of the other fire
signs<00:01:44.720> but<00:01:45.160> Sagittarius<00:01:46.180> Sagittarians<00:01:47.180> can

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
signs but Sagittarius Sagittarians can

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.149 
signs but Sagittarius Sagittarians can
be<00:01:47.480> a<00:01:47.510> bit<00:01:47.690> clumsy<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.230> also<00:01:48.680> another

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
be a bit clumsy and also another

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.700 
be a bit clumsy and also another
downside<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.640> Sagittarius<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.960> they

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
downside of Sagittarius is that they

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.010 
downside of Sagittarius is that they
they<00:01:52.310> want<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.790> speak<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.240> truth<00:01:53.390> they<00:01:53.720> want

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
they want to speak the truth they want

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.590 
they want to speak the truth they want

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
to be honest all the time and actually

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.440 
to be honest all the time and actually
sometimes<00:01:57.290> it's<00:01:57.680> inappropriate<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.820> they

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
sometimes it's inappropriate and they

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.030 
sometimes it's inappropriate and they
