my<00:00:08.460> Christmas<00:00:09.120> hat<00:00:09.599> project<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.769> been

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
my Christmas hat project that I've been

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.940 
my Christmas hat project that I've been
talking<00:00:11.759> about<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> little<00:00:12.179> bit<00:00:12.679> for<00:00:13.679> those<00:00:13.799> of

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
talking about a little bit for those of

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.379 
talking about a little bit for those of
you<00:00:14.009> who<00:00:14.130> haven't<00:00:14.280> tuned<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.700> before<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> found

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
you who haven't tuned in before I found

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.859 
you who haven't tuned in before I found

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
some battery-powered 99-cent LED

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.160 
some battery-powered 99-cent LED
Christmas<00:00:19.289> lights<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.430> local<00:00:20.910> CVS<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
Christmas lights at a local CVS and I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
Christmas lights at a local CVS and I
thought<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.769> too<00:00:23.250> cheap<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> pass

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
thought that was just too cheap to pass

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
thought that was just too cheap to pass
up<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> bought<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> couple<00:00:24.810> strands<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
up so I bought a couple strands and I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
up so I bought a couple strands and I
sort<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.880> figured<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.269> how<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.510> work<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
sort of figured out how they work and I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.890 
sort of figured out how they work and I
decided<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.890> try<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.420> remount<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.689> which

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
decided to try to remount them which

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
decided to try to remount them which
have<00:00:31.050> improved<00:00:31.410> electronics<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> hat<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
have improved electronics into a hat so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.880 
have improved electronics into a hat so
that<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> hat<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> would<00:00:34.620> blink

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that I would have a hat that would blink

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
that I would have a hat that would blink
and<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.280> other<00:00:35.430> sorts<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> fun<00:00:36.270> things<00:00:36.739> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and do other sorts of fun things so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
and do other sorts of fun things so
there's<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.100> strands<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.520> lights<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.940> one

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
there's two strands of lights here one

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.830 
there's two strands of lights here one
red<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.600> yellow<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:40.050> blue<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.559> green<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
red and yellow one blue and green that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
red and yellow one blue and green that
that<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> original<00:00:43.200> lights<00:00:43.680> came<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that the original lights came with and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
that the original lights came with and
they're<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.149> wired<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.600> parallel<00:00:45.950> they<00:00:46.950> were

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
they're all wired in parallel they were

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
they're all wired in parallel they were
kind<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> dim<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.730> 3.3<00:00:48.300> volts<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.960> each

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
kind of dim at 3.3 volts that each

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.810 
kind of dim at 3.3 volts that each
strand<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.710> draw<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:50.070> 20<00:00:50.370> milliamps

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
strand would draw about 20 milliamps

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
strand would draw about 20 milliamps
total<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.390> 40<00:00:51.780> milliamps<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.379> both

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
total about 40 milliamps with both

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.910 
total about 40 milliamps with both
lights<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.100> strung<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:55.110> didn't<00:00:55.860> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
lights are strung and I didn't think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.060 
lights are strung and I didn't think
that<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.250> quite<00:00:56.460> bright<00:00:56.879> enough<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that was quite bright enough so I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
that was quite bright enough so I
decided<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.600> see<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.840> would<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> 5

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
decided to see what they would do it 5

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.720 
decided to see what they would do it 5
volts<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:01.980> 5<00:01:02.100> volts<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:02.520> definitely

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
volts and at 5 volts they're definitely

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
volts and at 5 volts they're definitely
both<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.660> brighter<00:01:03.870> they're<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
both a little brighter they're kind of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
both a little brighter they're kind of
actually<00:01:04.799> nice<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.689> from<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
actually nice as you can see from this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.100 
actually nice as you can see from this
so<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> decided<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.820> ahead<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> drive<00:01:09.930> them

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so I decided to go ahead and drive them

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
so I decided to go ahead and drive them
with<00:01:10.260> 5<00:01:10.470> volts<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.430> means<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
with 5 volts which means that the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.840 
with 5 volts which means that the
current<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.869> 120<00:01:13.500> million

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
current was up to about 120 million

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.170 
current was up to about 120 million
which<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:17.180> microprocessor

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
which is a bit much for a microprocessor

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
which is a bit much for a microprocessor
to<00:01:18.330> drive<00:01:18.540> directly<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> use

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
to drive directly I'm just going to use

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.880 
to drive directly I'm just going to use
my<00:01:20.280> app<00:01:20.640> mel<00:01:20.850> ET<00:01:21.000> tiny<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.259> i<00:01:22.290> decided<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.740> go

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
my app mel ET tiny so i decided to go

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.960 
my app mel ET tiny so i decided to go
ahead<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.220> put<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.430> some<00:01:23.610> switching

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
ahead and put in some switching

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.899 
ahead and put in some switching
transistors<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.750> turn<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.200> off<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
transistors to turn them on and off and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.160 
transistors to turn them on and off and
as<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.180> their<00:01:27.420> cross<00:01:27.630> fading<00:01:28.049> now

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
as you can see their cross fading now

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.219 
as you can see their cross fading now
with<00:01:28.380> pulse<00:01:28.619> width<00:01:28.799> modulation<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> board

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with pulse width modulation the board

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
with pulse width modulation the board
that<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.439> constructed<00:01:32.040> I'll<00:01:32.369> turn<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> little

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that I constructed I'll turn this little

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.340 
that I constructed I'll turn this little
desk<00:01:33.869> lamp<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> here's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
desk lamp on so you can see is so here's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
desk lamp on so you can see is so here's
the<00:01:37.530> circuit<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> built<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> piece

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the circuit that I just built on a piece

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.310 
the circuit that I just built on a piece
of<00:01:38.970> perf<00:01:39.329> board<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.810> radio<00:01:40.110> shack<00:01:42.049> it's<00:01:43.049> got

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
of perf board from radio shack it's got

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.270 
of perf board from radio shack it's got
a<00:01:43.460> 7805<00:01:45.079> voltage<00:01:46.079> regulator<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.130> I'm

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
a 7805 voltage regulator because I'm

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609 
a 7805 voltage regulator because I'm
driving<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.640> from<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> 9<00:01:48.000> volt<00:01:48.030> supply<00:01:48.619> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
driving it from a 9 volt supply so

they don't quite go all the way off you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.010 
they don't quite go all the way off you

and green strand and you can leave them
steady<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.960> there<00:02:57.960> are<00:02:57.990> all<00:02:58.080> these

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
steady on so there are all these

the final jack in place i mounted i cut

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.220 
the final jack in place i mounted i cut
the<00:03:31.400> LED<00:03:32.400> strand<00:03:32.700> off<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.209> mounted<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.020> on<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the LED strand off and mounted it on a

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.020 
the LED strand off and mounted it on a
little<00:03:34.440> stereo<00:03:34.980> jack<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.550> i<00:03:35.610> could<00:03:35.670> plug

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
little stereo jack so that i could plug

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.620 
little stereo jack so that i could plug
it<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.300> and<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.980> moved<00:03:37.980> around<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.970> don't

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
it in and out and moved around I don't

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.600 
it in and out and moved around I don't
have<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.110> great<00:03:40.260> jack<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.430> plug

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
have a really great jack for it to plug

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.550 
have a really great jack for it to plug
into<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.780> now<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.080> have<00:03:43.290> some

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
into so right now I just have some

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.260 
into so right now I just have some
alligator<00:03:43.920> clips<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.400> are<00:03:44.459> clipping<00:03:44.910> on<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
alligator clips that are clipping on to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.900 
alligator clips that are clipping on to
the<00:03:45.360> edge<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> board<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.580> toggle<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.790> on

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
the edge of the board to toggle it on

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.960 
the edge of the board to toggle it on
and<00:03:48.120> off<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.480> hope<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.110> fix<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.700> when<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.730> first

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
and off I hope to fix that when I first

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.350 
and off I hope to fix that when I first
powered<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.700> one<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.910> strands<00:03:54.180> was

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
powered it on one of the strands was

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.210 
powered it on one of the strands was
working<00:03:54.660> perfectly<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.290> other<00:03:55.440> was<00:03:55.680> not<00:03:55.920> and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
working perfectly the other was not and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.370 
working perfectly the other was not and
I<00:03:57.060> looked<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.600> looked<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.050> looked<00:03:58.080> on

I looked and I looked and I looked on

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.040 
I looked and I looked and I looked on
the<00:03:58.410> look<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.800> I<00:03:58.860> finally<00:03:59.490> found<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.360> little

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
the look and I finally found a little

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.070 
the look and I finally found a little
tiny<00:04:01.560> solder<00:04:01.920> brich<00:04:02.310> which<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.720> instant<00:04:04.020> i

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
tiny solder brich which the instant i

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.449 
tiny solder brich which the instant i
clicked<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.440> off<00:04:04.560> everything<00:04:04.830> started<00:04:05.370> to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
clicked it off everything started to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.750 
clicked it off everything started to
work<00:04:05.580> perfectly<00:04:06.030> which<00:04:06.270> was<00:04:06.450> great<00:04:06.660> because<00:04:06.930> i

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
work perfectly which was great because i

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.710 
work perfectly which was great because i
kind<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.850> want<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.270> project<00:04:09.690> done

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
sent a hat around the edge these things

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.909 
sent a hat around the edge these things
flip<00:04:21.120> open<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.780> can<00:04:21.989> tuck<00:04:22.500> them<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.770> i'm

flip open so you can tuck them in i'm

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.170 
flip open so you can tuck them in i'm
going<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.160> tuck<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.460> wire<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.880> underneath

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
going to tuck the wire in underneath

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.220 
going to tuck the wire in underneath
here<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:24.720> maybe

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
here and maybe

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.600 
here and maybe
glue<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.590> maybe<00:04:25.800> stitch<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.400> haven't

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
glue it maybe stitch it I haven't

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.290 
glue it maybe stitch it I haven't
figured<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.000> maybe<00:04:27.930> velcro<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:30.180> then

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
figured that out maybe velcro and then

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.580 
figured that out maybe velcro and then
I'll<00:04:30.420> be<00:04:30.510> able<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.690> wear<00:04:30.840> my<00:04:30.990> Santa<00:04:31.320> hat<00:04:31.350> around

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
I'll be able to wear my Santa hat around

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.550 
I'll be able to wear my Santa hat around
and<00:04:31.920> it'll<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.460> all<00:04:32.640> blinky<00:04:33.180> I'm<00:04:34.140> figured<00:04:34.470> out

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
and it'll be all blinky I'm figured out

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.350 
and it'll be all blinky I'm figured out
whether<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:34.890> going<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.070> put<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.220> in<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.970> was

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
whether I'm going to put this in a I was

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.030 
whether I'm going to put this in a I was
thinking<00:04:36.510> maybe<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:36.930> just<00:04:37.200> make<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.380> little<00:04:37.620> sort

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
thinking maybe I just make a little sort

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.110 
thinking maybe I just make a little sort
of<00:04:38.130> fabric<00:04:39.090> bag<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.600> hold<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.110> place<00:04:41.120> it

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
of fabric bag to hold this in place it

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.580 
of fabric bag to hold this in place it
doesn't<00:04:42.510> seem<00:04:42.690> like<00:04:42.720> mounting<00:04:43.170> ending<00:04:43.410> and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
doesn't seem like mounting ending and

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.350 
doesn't seem like mounting ending and
aren't<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.840> in<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:46.800> altoids<00:04:47.550> tin<00:04:47.760> which<00:04:48.210> is

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
aren't in a in a altoids tin which is

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.970 
aren't in a in a altoids tin which is
another<00:04:48.570> possibility<00:04:48.810> would<00:04:49.260> really<00:04:49.680> be<00:04:49.800> that

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
another possibility would really be that

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.310 
another possibility would really be that
great<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.280> an<00:04:50.370> idea<00:04:50.510> but<00:04:51.510> I'll<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:52.080> have<00:04:52.200> to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
great of an idea but I'll just have to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.050 
great of an idea but I'll just have to
