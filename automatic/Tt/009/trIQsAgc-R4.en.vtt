00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.530
 for the radical sports version of the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.300
 308 we will have to wait a few more 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.759
 month and the Frankfurt lounge to see 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 appear an era where a gti of 270 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.890
 horses 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 today it's the turn of the 308 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 I was in the middle this name I was 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 great tourism which, with the promise of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.960
 powerful yet flexible car 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 comfortable to be able to make 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 long journeys then let's see everything 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.279
 immediately behind the little steering wheel 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.279
 this 308 is and what it returns 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 we logically preferred 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
 gt version strong sense of 205 horses at the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 version of 180 horses and boxes 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.770
 automatic are which are identical 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.390
 in sedan how break sw 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 we recognize them with its beautiful colors 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 exclusive blue optional inputs 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 air in the shield that replaces the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.739
 fog lights small turn signals 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 the scrolling help of pretty rims of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.039
 18 inches and a rear shield with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 exhaust outlets completely 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.449
 dummy the truth is hidden in truth 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 under the shield we find in the 308 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.570
 gti the same typical driving position 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.040
 of the 308 with this little steering wheel 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 located under the instrumentation 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.590
 which means you have to find no 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.030
 only the right position that we fight 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.950
 physical but also the good 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 visual position is also not bad 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.549
 details specific to this version 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.200
 gtc liseret on the dashboard that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.880
 are called on the very beautiful seats 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 leather tubs that are optional here 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 on this test model or the pommel of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860
 gearshift to him a whole bunch of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.390
 details like that it's refined sports 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.390
 but not too much in the spirit gt r 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.759
 and this universe corresponds indeed 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.340
 pretty much the definition of the car 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.530
 in the 6 liter engine develops 285 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.420
 newton-meters of torque from 1750 tours 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 minute what to offer times 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 generous question acceleration nothing 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.939
 very spectacular driving even though the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.369
 car only needs seven seconds 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.530
 5 to reach the 100 km the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.690
 suspension dropped from 7 to 10 mm and the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.670
 michelin pilot sport tires 3 ensures a 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.259
 effective and faultless behavior 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.090
 we can take a lot of fun at 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.860
 flying 7,300 miles gtm alone 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.119
 condition very stingy conti his 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.580
 philosophy and how to use it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.259
 it is a gt with a full engine 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 the cost of the lowest schemes very very 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.860
 full ram used to go looking for 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.340
 dull and horses close to the area 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.709
 red 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 at the limit the possibility that remains 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.390
 for those who want a little more 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.340
 sensations 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.510
 it's the sport mode just a market 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.769
 of a button and that gives 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 the sound accompaniment that gives 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.640
 the impression of having a motor much more 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.580
 big hug and 6 turbo of 2 105 hp and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.170
 brooke team this car a sound 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.209
 serious is nice but completely 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.350
 artificial since it's a soundtrack 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.540
 that accompany revs 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.060
 the engine almost realistically 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.860
 sport mode the handset turns red and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 displays torque power and pressure 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.340
 supercharging while the crew of 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
 the accelerator and the direccte on 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.600
 favorite sports or equipping the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.709
 308 gti is particularly complete there 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.299
 obviously includes the system 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.609
 infotainment that is known in 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.530
 the psa range is a system that on the 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.840
 paper is super complete very modern 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.340
 perfectly interesting but to the used 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.650
 a little bit another story we are 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.940
 obliged to go through menus that are 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.769
 not necessarily always very clear 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 keys not a respondent always 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.670
 very nice it must be used for 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.019
 adjust the temperature to adjust 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.880
 some elements of the car 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.250
 obviously to go through the radio and 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.320
 by navigation is a system that at 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.200
 final is more annoying than frankly 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.930
 useful 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.430
 the 308 is a well-born car that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.560
 here come performances well in 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.670
 harmony with its potential version 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.950
 fast and comfortable 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.599
 the contract is respected that promises 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.080
 for the future sports version more 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.080
 radical
