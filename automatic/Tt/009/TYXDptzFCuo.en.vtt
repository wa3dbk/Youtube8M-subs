00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.890
 Freedom is the greatest privilege 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.590
 that man has and in this prison the 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.380
 football for 90 minutes gave him that nel 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.540
 to the prisoners who live in it 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.090
 the environment was the same as that lived in 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.980
 the court of recife against croatia 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.529
 although here freedom is the only 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.779
 absent in this great eric party is a 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.910
 defendant who is serving a sentence for robbery and 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.790
 although it takes many years to get out 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.710
 football is your best medicine for 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.239
 forget your problems a little if in 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.439
 actually if you do not get out of here you 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.600
 you forget everything that you are in the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.329
 jail but already coming back to call them 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.030
 to the same and the pain of not being with 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.790
 his family is evident and with the family 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.980
 since seeing it for a moment you value it 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.420
 little by little you do not value it and in the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.000
 moments that you live with them to the fullest 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.220
 angel is the man who puts joy 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.570
 with his drum and I pay a very big penalty 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.730
 for homicide though the gift 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.310
 it is difficult not to be here living together 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.790
 with a lot of people who are partners of us and 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.159
 the truth is there are people who are not here because 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.829
 crime that he did not commit there are no people who 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.689
 yes we committed the crime and the truth 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.820
 we are paying something we did not something 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.530
 of all the life that we have done few 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 men recognize their sins 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.270
 although this hard life makes them 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.810
 confess from the depths of your 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.240
 soul after something that motivates you to the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.920
 people do these events so they see 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.640
 that there are not just bad people 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.580
 excellent delinquent here in that place 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.340
 it's something it 's sad but very sad 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.220
 but now here with this environment 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.070
 do not re- understand yourself but then something 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.190
 comfortable if the Mexican team beat 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 Croatia to get their pass to eighths 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.750
 so involuntary happiness not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.750
 I'm so sorry but this one was ephemeral 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 because tomorrow they will return to their sad 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.009
 reality miguel bautista and luis piezo
