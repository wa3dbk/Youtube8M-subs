that<00:00:30.240> much<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:31.470> kind<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that much of they're not very kind of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.299 
that much of they're not very kind of

high coverage but I just want them to be

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.280 
high coverage but I just want them to be
lightweight<00:00:35.610> easy<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> blend<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.110> know

lightweight easy to blend and you know

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200

kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> low<00:00:37.770> maintenance<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.969> want<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
kind of low maintenance if you want to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
kind of low maintenance if you want to
see<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> apply<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.230> concealer<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:41.100> let's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
see how I apply my concealer then let's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.430 
see how I apply my concealer then let's
get<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:46.140> already

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
get into it so I'm actually already

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.459 
get into it so I'm actually already
wearing<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.039> foundation<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.440> think

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
wearing my foundation and that's I think

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.750 
wearing my foundation and that's I think
one<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.010> rules<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.520> applying

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
one of the first rules for applying

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
one of the first rules for applying
concealer<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.780> least<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.140> me<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
concealer is at least for me and you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
concealer is at least for me and you
always<00:00:53.070> wear<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.309> foundation<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.390> your

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
always wear your foundation the for your

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
always wear your foundation the for your
concealer<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.199> reason<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.829> say<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
concealer the reason I say that is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
concealer the reason I say that is
number<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:58.109> foundation<00:00:58.500> will

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
number one because your foundation will

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.020 
number one because your foundation will
already<00:00:58.859> give<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.370> coverage<00:00:59.789> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
already give you some coverage so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 
already give you some coverage so
already<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
already you will have some of the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
already you will have some of the
darkness<00:01:01.739> being<00:01:01.980> hidden<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.520> number<00:01:03.329> two<00:01:03.600> if

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
darkness being hidden and number two if

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
darkness being hidden and number two if
you<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.619> way<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.519> if

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you do it the other way around like if

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.160 
you do it the other way around like if
you<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.939> your<00:01:06.210> concealer<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:07.020> your

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you do your concealer and then your

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
you do your concealer and then your
foundation<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.610> blending<00:01:09.000> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
foundation then when you are blending in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
foundation then when you are blending in
your<00:01:09.210> foundation<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.810> concealer<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.380> gonna

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
your foundation or concealer it's gonna

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.490 
your foundation or concealer it's gonna
get<00:01:10.710> much<00:01:11.100> done<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.760> no<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.290> Jeep

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.090 
foundation before I am already doing
that<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.150> second<00:01:18.479> step<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.530> course<00:01:19.830> take

that the second step is of course take

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
that the second step is of course take
your<00:01:20.310> concealer<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.860> see

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
your concealer the one I have is you see

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.270 
your concealer the one I have is you see
this<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.670> videos<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.720> Bobbi<00:01:24.930> Brown

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
this in all my videos the Bobbi Brown

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
this in all my videos the Bobbi Brown
tinted<00:01:26.280> eye<00:01:26.430> bright<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.150> peach<00:01:27.479> 0-8<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
tinted eye bright now in peach 0-8 and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
tinted eye bright now in peach 0-8 and
this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> lightweight

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is a very kind of lightweight

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.380 
this is a very kind of lightweight
concealer<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> used<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> apply

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
concealer so the way I used to apply

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
concealer so the way I used to apply
this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.990> different<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.740> how<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> would<00:01:35.250> apply

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this is different from how I would apply

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
this is different from how I would apply
any<00:01:35.700> other<00:01:35.820> concealer<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> comes<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
any other concealer and then it comes to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
any other concealer and then it comes to
that<00:01:37.259> later<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.619> first<00:01:38.130> let's<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.549> apply

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that later but first let's just apply

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
that later but first let's just apply
this<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:40.020> take<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
this so I'm just gonna take this and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.060 
this so I'm just gonna take this and
then<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:42.630> gonna<00:01:42.750> draw<00:01:43.049> some<00:01:43.320> shapes<00:01:43.350> under

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then you're gonna draw some shapes under

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
then you're gonna draw some shapes under
the<00:01:44.310> eye<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.820> draw<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> triangle<00:01:46.020> under

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the eye so draw like a triangle under

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
the eye so draw like a triangle under
your<00:01:46.380> Ayad<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.759> close<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> lash<00:01:48.600> line

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
your Ayad I go as close to the lash line

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.609 
your Ayad I go as close to the lash line
as<00:01:48.930> possible<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:53.030> draw<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> like

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.340 

triangle<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.249> then<00:01:58.640> what<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:58.880> do<00:01:59.030> is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
triangle like this and then what I do is

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.969 
triangle like this and then what I do is
essentially<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.380> wipe<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:02.560> with<00:02:03.560> my<00:02:03.770> ring

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
essentially just wipe it with my ring

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.809 
essentially just wipe it with my ring
finger<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.159> covers<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.880> entire<00:02:07.909> area<00:02:09.819> and

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
finger so it covers the entire area and

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:20.430 
finger so it covers the entire area and
once<00:02:11.150> have<00:02:11.330> swiped<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.959> I<00:02:12.080> Pat<00:02:12.379> it<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.709> place

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.199 

once<00:02:21.440> I've<00:02:21.830> done<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.099> I'm<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.819> gonna<00:02:22.940> go<00:02:23.090> in

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
and check if there's any spot left and I

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.130 
and check if there's any spot left and I
can<00:02:25.220> see<00:02:25.370> there's<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> little<00:02:26.120> patch<00:02:26.720> over

now<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:05.129> I've<00:03:05.340> done<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.150> whole<00:03:06.269> concealer

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
now that I've done the whole concealer

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.869 
now that I've done the whole concealer
application<00:03:07.379> under<00:03:07.620> my<00:03:07.709> eye<00:03:07.920> I'm<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:08.730> gonna

that's<00:03:11.549> something<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.540> even<00:03:12.629> if

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
that's something that I think even if

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.000 
that's something that I think even if
you<00:03:12.870> don't<00:03:13.049> ever<00:03:13.230> use<00:03:13.439> powder<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.859> your<00:03:13.950> face

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
you don't ever use powder on your face

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.440 
you don't ever use powder on your face
you<00:03:14.430> should<00:03:14.489> always<00:03:14.819> set<00:03:15.150> your<00:03:15.269> concealer

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
you should always set your concealer

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.000 
you should always set your concealer
with<00:03:15.840> powder<00:03:15.870> because<00:03:16.409> it<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:16.889> of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
with powder because it just kind of

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:26.569 
with powder because it just kind of
moves<00:03:17.310> around<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.760> your<00:03:17.849> face<00:03:25.099> just<00:03:26.099> make<00:03:26.310> sure
