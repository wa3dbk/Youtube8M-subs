00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.340
 here are his parents by chance shows 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.179
 32nd place at the right time 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.279
 the output of women that men are ideally shot this is a story that 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.279
 hard it is this type is suitable for style 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.359
 during this month 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.789
 as a whole comments death announced a fashionable site these guys 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.019
 who are not stable electric comedy what are we going to launch the 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.899
 equipment 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.489
 one should understand 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.610
 candle in hand and approach 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.300
 without moving it is a question of balance but here it is necessary that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.020
 it hinders the center of gravity 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.090
 when you found it all right then you're here because you have 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.970
 participated in the big party in nara 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.010
 it was just now so how did it go 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.780
 mitterrand it was a beautiful party 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 tl test and if the successes 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.600
 what is important is that they are happy 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.310
 we let him believe yes and he did not look disappointed but coming out of 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.680
 scene they looked more 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.450
 all night as boys 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.800
 frankly it was pretty upsetting 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.700
 yes it was a very beautiful moment I take a designer I think of 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 ask the shortcomings of the senate proposed that one can discover everything 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 immediately smaller images 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 the center that did not show up 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 his drawings with chalk 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.020
 state street associates 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 it had to be 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.020
 it had to be part of 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 he does some good scenes 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.440
 how is it going for the better 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.750
 the German manufacturer 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.870
 we will start with fear of a repetition 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.880
 most of us I think 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 we all know the meeting more or less work with him 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.099
 and so it's German selection with 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.449
 a net 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.369
 porsche is a clear indication of his invitation to come back 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:19.769
 rehearsals before 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.669
 the slowdown for 30 years 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.519
 we end up like this in a party 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.680
 we look at things differently when we do our concert tonight 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.919
 I hope now 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.149
 that is to say, how do you feel merritt 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.099
 I think we have France we feel 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.229
 the manager 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:36.839
 we want the person 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.839
 in fact be accepted is happy 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.319
 so yes I had more trains than usual it is he is responsible 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.409
 from his own concert 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.409
 it's more stressful because you're not in your repertoire necessarily 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.819
 and we leave a little like a tightrope walker 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.659
 we appreciate 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.699
 over a year they will spin it still has the jitters still that this job I think but 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.929
 I let it add because we are 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.999
 in another element is in dress not disappoint the person who has avoided us 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.499
 empathy 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.449
 and for my case to sing with 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.449
 several people like a lego morano with 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.139
 but it's something out there and so troy has all the trouble to 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.699
 me in any case it is the case I go freak you there are not at the end of a 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.799
 moment it is necessary to speak about it is not too much his shot 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.069
 note that he promised mountains and deserts in any case one of these images 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.400
 of the city now by cons I think we will be able to keep it 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.349
 together 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.349
 that is the meaning of the history of the worlds 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.369
 still a little bit my text anyway 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:02.929
 I say goodbye anyway read my text more than right the news 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:03.919
 songs 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.619
 now official of the game frankly I did not know by heart I 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.279
 tried i try to take it but fault declared half forgiven 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.729
 then because we know it but we will say that you know Roya treatment well 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.340
 reserved for sponsors rÃ©jean savard olivier besancenot 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.379
 I have always been 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.969
 the more you became 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.969
 left health 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 with a pool 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 my russian mother and a father of my husband excess 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.559
 and it is by my husband this husband who is the father of my daughter that I had 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:52.189
 place 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.189
 the happiness of meeting him stommelen 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.340
 and to others it will be that or I will say it clicked right away 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.710
 the film wrote wonders I was spoiled and we know it 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.539
 we have become the most that employees really detained 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.240
 friends 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 so what do you like about him? 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.469
 pardon what do you like about him at mclaren 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.189
 but all is well all this is a concert 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.460
 the explorers of music 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.849
 what is a love is a lover of 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.849
 of musical research he likes beautiful texts 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.189
 realize them 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.870
 leasing and illegal financing 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.279
 he is a complete man 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.110
 he is a man he has a great voice 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.349
 in South Kivu at its origin 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.129
 that's what I notice first when he's going to bring me the model for 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.520
 my first album 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.000
 he has a super thin voice 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.250
 humanly that is not possible whereas I like it much more than 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.340
 other
