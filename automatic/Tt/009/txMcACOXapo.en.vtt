these a plastic drainage tubes that I

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.939 
these a plastic drainage tubes that I
cut<00:00:11.100> up<00:00:11.129> in<00:00:11.520> small<00:00:11.910> sections<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.930> a<00:00:12.959> cut<00:00:13.770> worm

cut up in small sections for a cut worm
prevention<00:00:14.780> as<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.049> know<00:00:16.170> cut<00:00:16.410> worms<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.949> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
prevention as you know cut worms like to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
prevention as you know cut worms like to
wrap<00:00:17.340> their<00:00:17.580> bodies<00:00:18.000> around<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.480> base<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
wrap their bodies around the base of a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
wrap their bodies around the base of a
plan<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> they'll<00:00:19.650> chew<00:00:19.950> through<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.490> until

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670

the transplant basically it's completely

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.760 
the transplant basically it's completely
cut<00:00:24.240> through<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.780> base<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.230> falls<00:00:25.500> over

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
cut through at the base and falls over

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.820 
cut through at the base and falls over
and<00:00:26.040> dies<00:00:26.840> there<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:28.080> been<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.530> studies

and dies there have been some studies

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.850 
and dies there have been some studies
that<00:00:29.130> show<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.789> reduction<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.840> cut<00:00:31.200> burn<00:00:31.440> damage

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
that show a reduction in cut burn damage

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.369 
that show a reduction in cut burn damage
up<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> eighty<00:00:32.640> percent<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.420> using<00:00:33.719> collars

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
up to eighty percent by using collars

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
like toilet paper rolls cut up but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
like toilet paper rolls cut up but
doesn't<00:00:42.359> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> work<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.409> you're

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

use a these drainage tubes and cut them

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.939 
use a these drainage tubes and cut them
up<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.760> take<00:00:51.479> them<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.780> every<00:00:52.170> year<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> save

them again for the next year i have them
a<00:00:54.690> string<00:00:55.409> ran<00:00:55.679> through<00:00:56.100> each<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.609> tubes

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
a string ran through each of the tubes

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.959 
a string ran through each of the tubes
that<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.659> i<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.809> carry<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.670> majority<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> them

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that way i can carry a majority of them

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.809 
that way i can carry a majority of them
around<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.690> time<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.249> i'll<00:01:02.249> put<00:01:02.549> them<00:01:02.639> on

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
around at one time so i'll put them on

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.700 
around at one time so i'll put them on
and<00:01:03.120> show<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.389> how<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.749> looks<00:01:03.960> after<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.680> I

and show you how it looks after it I
have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.150> transplant<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:07.200> blooming

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
have a transplant that is blooming

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
have a transplant that is blooming
already<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
already and I really don't want the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
already and I really don't want the
plant<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.890> setting<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:11.820> fruit<00:01:12.240> yet

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
plant to be setting on any fruit yet

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
plant to be setting on any fruit yet
it's<00:01:12.780> still<00:01:12.980> too<00:01:13.980> small<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> wanted<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's still too small and I wanted to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.540 
it's still too small and I wanted to
focus<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.690> vegetative<00:01:16.470> growth<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.160> on

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
focus on vegetative growth more than on

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.180 
focus on vegetative growth more than on
a<00:01:17.690> fruiting<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> putting<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.160> that

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
a fruiting and and putting all that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.840 
a fruiting and and putting all that
energy<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.330> production<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.990> fruit<00:01:22.290> so

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
energy into the production of fruit so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.210 
energy into the production of fruit so
one<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.120> I'll<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.510> if<00:01:24.720> i<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.010> blooms<00:01:26.010> like

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
one thing I'll do if i see blooms like

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600 
one thing I'll do if i see blooms like
that<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.690> tell<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> blossoms<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.980> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that you can tell the blossoms there is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
that you can tell the blossoms there is
just<00:01:29.910> pinch<00:01:30.210> em<00:01:30.390> off<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.760> way<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> plant

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
just pinch em off and that way the plant

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.070 
just pinch em off and that way the plant
focuses<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.430> its<00:01:35.670> production<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.330> vegetative

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
focuses all its production on vegetative

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.000 
focuses all its production on vegetative
growth<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.490> fruiting<00:01:39.150> yet

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
growth and not on the fruiting yet

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.970 
growth and not on the fruiting yet
here's<00:01:41.010> my<00:01:41.220> cutworm<00:01:41.850> collars<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.800> how<00:01:43.950> i

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
here's my cutworm collars and see how i

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.370 
here's my cutworm collars and see how i
put<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.370> around<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> plant<00:01:47.870> ground<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.140> hard

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
put it around the plant ground is hard

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
put it around the plant ground is hard
because<00:01:49.620> we<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.610> inch<00:01:50.820> rain<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.420> other

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
because we got a one inch rain the other

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
because we got a one inch rain the other
day<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> would<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.560> been<00:01:52.650> better<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.190> get

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
day it would have been better to get

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.570 
day it would have been better to get
this<00:01:53.520> done<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.660> know<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.080> same<00:01:55.320> day<00:01:55.500> we

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
transplanted by ran out of time and then

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.399 
transplanted by ran out of time and then
we<00:01:58.590> had<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> hospital<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.409> we'll
