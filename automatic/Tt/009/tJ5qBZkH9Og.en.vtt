00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.840 
to compare it to my mineralized
skinfinish<00:01:34.700> they<00:01:35.689> are<00:01:36.189> pretty<00:01:37.189> similar<00:01:37.549> in

smooth<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.349> one<00:01:57.349> was<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> lot<00:01:57.770> easier<00:01:57.799> to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
smooth so that one was a lot easier to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.569 
smooth so that one was a lot easier to
pick<00:01:58.520> up<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.270> powder<00:01:59.509> with<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:01.069> can<00:02:01.280> see

that<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.630> care<00:02:02.869> blend<00:02:03.110> which<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.799> finger

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
that the care blend which is this finger

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.339 
that the care blend which is this finger
it's<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.149> lot<00:02:05.329> more<00:02:05.539> yellow<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.670> tone<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:08.349> the

it's a lot more yellow in tone and the
mineralized<00:02:09.709> skinfinish<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.640> bit<00:02:11.360> more<00:02:11.390> like

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
mineralized skinfinish is bit more like

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.479 
mineralized skinfinish is bit more like

show<00:02:26.329> up<00:02:26.360> too<00:02:26.599> well<00:02:31.209> see<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.900> blends

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
show up too well see so this one blends

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.170 
show up too well see so this one blends
in<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.500> well<00:02:34.100> with<00:02:34.130> my<00:02:34.250> skin<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.940> care

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.059 
in really well with my skin the care
blend<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:38.139> buff<00:02:39.139> it<00:02:39.290> into<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:39.739> skin<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
blend I have to buff it into my skin a

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.420 
blend I have to buff it into my skin a
little<00:02:40.250> bit<00:02:40.459> more<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.030> does<00:02:41.299> disappear

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
little bit more but it does disappear

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:52.120 
little bit more but it does disappear
and<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.420> last<00:02:44.630> time<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.980> those

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
and it's one last time just so for those

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.250 
and it's one last time just so for those
with<00:02:52.310> stronger<00:02:52.700> yellow<00:02:53.000> undertones<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.989> would

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
with stronger yellow undertones I would

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.220 
with stronger yellow undertones I would
suggest<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:55.069> cared<00:02:55.310> 1<00:02:55.519> powder<00:02:56.019> because<00:02:57.019> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
suggest the cared 1 powder because that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.750 
suggest the cared 1 powder because that
one<00:02:57.440> does<00:02:57.650> show<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:57.980> more<00:02:58.190> yellow<00:02:58.609> and<00:03:00.760> for

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
one does show up more yellow and for

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.089 
one does show up more yellow and for
everyone<00:03:02.120> else<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.599> would<00:03:02.840> suggest<00:03:03.099> mineralize

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
everyone else I would suggest mineralize

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.449 
everyone else I would suggest mineralize
