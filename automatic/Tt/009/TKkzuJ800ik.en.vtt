00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.350 
okay I'm Katie from What Katie bore I
think<00:00:08.380> the<00:00:08.889> probably<00:00:09.459> two<00:00:09.610> key<00:00:09.820> things<00:00:09.850> that<00:00:10.209> i

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
think the probably two key things that i

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.200 
think the probably two key things that i
took<00:00:10.450> out<00:00:10.719> tonight<00:00:11.139> were<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:12.610> transatlantic

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
took out tonight were a transatlantic

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.509 
took out tonight were a transatlantic
debate<00:00:13.780> that<00:00:14.230> perhaps<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.889> Brits<00:00:15.099> are<00:00:15.280> quite

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
debate that perhaps the Brits are quite

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.519 
debate that perhaps the Brits are quite
ready<00:00:15.759> for<00:00:15.880> advertising<00:00:16.480> and<00:00:16.810> maybe<00:00:17.230> we<00:00:17.410> need

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
ready for advertising and maybe we need

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.990 
ready for advertising and maybe we need
to<00:00:17.560> catch<00:00:17.770> up<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.189> u.s.<00:00:18.430> in<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.669> front

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
to catch up to the u.s. in that front

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.510 
to catch up to the u.s. in that front
and<00:00:19.810> then<00:00:20.140> I<00:00:20.169> think<00:00:20.439> also<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:21.130> it's<00:00:21.369> something

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
and then I think also and it's something

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.800 
and then I think also and it's something
that<00:00:21.640> everyone<00:00:21.849> always<00:00:22.060> says<00:00:22.329> time<00:00:22.540> and<00:00:22.689> time

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
that everyone always says time and time

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.700 
that everyone always says time and time

is now not so much just credible but
it's<00:01:02.170> actually<00:01:02.260> probably<00:01:02.530> going<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:02.920> be<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190

think<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.820> was<00:02:48.150> made<00:02:48.450> clear<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.500> some

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
think that was made clear because some

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.560 
think that was made clear because some
people<00:02:50.160> talk<00:02:50.700> about<00:02:50.730> bloggers<00:02:51.329> have<00:02:51.420> been

some people talk about websites so I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
some people talk about websites so I
thought<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.519> wasn't<00:02:53.880> clear<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.540> as<00:02:54.900> well

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
thought that wasn't clear and as well

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.850 
thought that wasn't clear and as well
I'm<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.320> interested<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.220> how<00:02:56.459> people
