00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
I think it kind of has to do with a lot

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.130 
I think it kind of has to do with a lot
of<00:01:25.130> things<00:01:25.310> with<00:01:26.020> confidence<00:01:27.020> from

Supercross helped a ton you can't buy
that<00:01:29.510> stuff<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.380> once<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.770> get<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.070> you

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
that stuff and and once you get it you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.060 
that stuff and and once you get it you
get<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.300> ball<00:01:32.450> rolling<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:32.930> it's<00:01:33.830> kind<00:01:34.009> of

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
get the ball rolling and it's kind of

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.980 
get the ball rolling and it's kind of
full<00:01:34.190> steam<00:01:34.430> ahead<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:34.909> that's<00:01:35.540> helped<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.840> ton
