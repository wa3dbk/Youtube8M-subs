00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.229 
doesn't seem to be completing those
juggles<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.090> he's<00:03:08.209> still<00:03:08.540> got<00:03:09.220> about<00:03:10.220> 50%<00:03:11.120> out

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.960 
juggles but he's still got about 50% out
one<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:12.050> little<00:03:12.319> too

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.539 

I<00:03:20.140> think<00:03:21.140> you<00:03:21.260> saw<00:03:21.440> master<00:03:21.709> his<00:03:22.040> trademark<00:03:22.430> of

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
I think you saw master his trademark of

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:23.680 
I think you saw master his trademark of
jumping<00:03:22.849> over<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.060> opponent<00:03:23.390> hit<00:03:23.480> him<00:03:23.569> from

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
jumping over the opponent hit him from

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.240 
jumping over the opponent hit him from
behind<00:03:23.810> getting<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.290> small<00:03:24.470> damage<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:24.980> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
behind getting that small damage in and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.830 
behind getting that small damage in and
basically<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.790> think<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.090> frustrates<00:03:26.720> his

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
basically I think that frustrates his

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.809 
basically I think that frustrates his
opponents<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.500> allows<00:03:28.069> them<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> be<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.580> little

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
opponents and allows them to be a little

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.979 
opponents and allows them to be a little
more<00:03:28.879> aggressive<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.330> little<00:03:29.360> more<00:03:29.629> careless

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
more aggressive a little more careless

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.539 
more aggressive a little more careless
and<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> takes<00:03:30.860> advantage<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.280> moment

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
and it takes advantage of that moment

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.039 
and it takes advantage of that moment
well<00:03:31.970> there's<00:03:32.120> still<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.330> lot<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.569> time<00:03:32.780> left

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
well there's still a lot of time left

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.990 
well there's still a lot of time left
let's<00:03:33.319> see<00:03:33.440> if<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.590> can<00:03:33.739> come<00:03:33.920> back<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.730> map
