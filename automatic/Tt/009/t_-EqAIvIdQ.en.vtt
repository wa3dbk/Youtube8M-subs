00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.730
 this one was disintegrated the same 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 the security problems in the region 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.690

 Swiss Nigerian and an Egyptian 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 on July 17 , 2014 the plane m 17 of 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.080
 malaysia airlines was shot down with 298 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.869
 people on board today eight days later 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.000
 has not yet found a responsible and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.820
 the family of this flight are still 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.400
 have an explanation 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 for a change it 's an old news for 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 the means for which will be another news 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.479
 that will remain in the mystery 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.440
 also 139 days have passed since the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.369
 h 370 m flight Malaysia Airlines 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.369
 disappeared without any explanation 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.780
 then we pose the question 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.640
 if it is normal that in our times the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.460
 planes are lost and nobody gets 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 responsible for demolishing airplanes without 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 find a culprit and that the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.460
 airlines and authorities work 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.460
 please so that nobody does anything 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.149
 I leave you with this so that we are not 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.240
 forget that the only ones we can demand 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.690
 answer is us if we 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.580
 we sleep governments companies and so on 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.950
 they will continue acting as if nothing and the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 we will always be affected 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.870
