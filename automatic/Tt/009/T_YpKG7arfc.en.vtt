in<00:01:29.829> terms<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.159> kielbasa<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.030> things<00:01:31.929> you've

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
in terms of kielbasa and things you've

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.749 
in terms of kielbasa and things you've
worked<00:01:32.289> on<00:01:32.469> football<00:01:32.679> wise<00:01:33.039> or<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:33.549> purely

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
worked on football wise or is it purely

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.580 
worked on football wise or is it purely
just<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.179> physical<00:01:34.450> element<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.929> it<00:01:35.049> for<00:01:35.170> now<00:01:35.200> I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
just a physical element of it for now I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.440 
just a physical element of it for now I
think<00:01:36.189> initially<00:01:36.399> it's<00:01:36.759> more<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.060> physical

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
think initially it's more the physical

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.440 
think initially it's more the physical
element<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:39.369> want<00:01:39.549> them<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.700> start

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
element you just want them to start

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.469 
element you just want them to start
doing<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.719> basics<00:01:41.109> right<00:01:41.319> again<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:43.329> might

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
doing the basics right again we might

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.359 
doing the basics right again we might
try<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:44.109> or<00:01:44.229> two<00:01:44.380> things<00:01:44.619> but<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:44.950> comes

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
try one or two things but that comes

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.429 
try one or two things but that comes
more<00:01:45.759> in<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.450> next<00:01:46.600> couple<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.020> weeks<00:01:47.200> in

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
more in the next couple of weeks in

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.190 
more in the next couple of weeks in
training<00:01:48.009> camp<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.509> then<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.869> games<00:01:50.079> that
