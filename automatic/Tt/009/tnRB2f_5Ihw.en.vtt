about upgrading your screen on the
Lenovo<00:00:12.179> y46<00:00:12.960> T<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.580> current<00:00:14.910> screen<00:00:15.059> on

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
Lenovo y46 T so the current screen on

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.170 
Lenovo y46 T so the current screen on
the<00:00:15.690> lenovo<00:00:15.960> y40<00:00:16.529> has<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.570> 1366<00:00:18.570> by<00:00:18.720> 768<00:00:20.180> pixel

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the lenovo y40 has a 1366 by 768 pixel

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900 
the lenovo y40 has a 1366 by 768 pixel
display<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.830> upgrade<00:00:23.250> technique<00:00:23.670> only

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
display and this upgrade technique only

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
display and this upgrade technique only
works<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> y<00:00:24.750> 460<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.830> don't<00:00:25.980> try<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.220> if

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
works for the y 460 so don't try this if

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.679 
works for the y 460 so don't try this if
you<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> wife<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.330> 70<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.019> wife<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:28.859> 70<00:00:29.400> P<00:00:29.689> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you have a wife or 70 or wife or 70 P so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
you have a wife or 70 or wife or 70 P so
we<00:00:30.810> chose<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.230> screen<00:00:31.529> because<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we chose this screen because of the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.430 
we chose this screen because of the
mounting<00:00:32.610> requirements<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.960> pin

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
mounting requirements and the pin

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
mounting requirements and the pin
requirements<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> 40<00:00:36.120> pin

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
requirements as well you need a 40 pin

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.810 
requirements as well you need a 40 pin
connector<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.550> own

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
connector so you do this at your own

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
connector so you do this at your own
risk<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.930> may<00:00:40.170> possibly<00:00:40.440> void<00:00:40.920> your

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
risk and you may possibly void your

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.250 
risk and you may possibly void your
warranty<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.390> doesn't<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> Y

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
warranty now this doesn't work on the Y

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.500 
warranty now this doesn't work on the Y
470<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> 30<00:00:45.000> pin<00:00:45.239> data

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
470 because it has a 30 pin data

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
470 because it has a 30 pin data
connector<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> Y<00:00:46.469> 460<00:00:47.250> has<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> 40<00:00:48.120> pin

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
connector and the Y 460 has a 40 pin

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.690 
connector and the Y 460 has a 40 pin
data<00:00:48.510> connector<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.230> again<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.370> try<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
data connector so again don't try this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.029 
data connector so again don't try this
if<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> wife<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.989> 70<00:00:52.410> only<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
if you have a wife or 70 only if you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.270 
if you have a wife or 70 only if you
have<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> wife<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.730> 60<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> before<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.980> start

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have a wife or 60 so before we start

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
have a wife or 60 so before we start
let's<00:00:56.489> take<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> look<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.120> tools<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.570> we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
let's take a look at our tools here we

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
let's take a look at our tools here we
have<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.320> interchangeable<00:00:59.039> screw<00:00:59.910> driver<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
have an interchangeable screw driver you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
have an interchangeable screw driver you
don't<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.010> use

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
don't really need that you can just use

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
don't really need that you can just use
a<00:01:02.190> Phillips<00:01:02.579> head<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.809> fancy

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a Phillips head but you know it's fancy

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
a Phillips head but you know it's fancy
so<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.549> an<00:01:05.670> optional<00:01:06.090> magnetic

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so we also have an optional magnetic

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
so we also have an optional magnetic
pickup<00:01:06.840> tool<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.400> magnetic<00:01:08.700> tray<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
pickup tool and a magnetic tray so we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560 
pickup tool and a magnetic tray so we
don't<00:01:09.600> lose<00:01:09.750> anything<00:01:11.150> okay<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> first

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
don't lose anything okay so the first

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.789 
don't lose anything okay so the first
thing<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> want<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> shut<00:01:13.619> off<00:01:13.650> a

thing you want to do is shut off a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.810 
thing you want to do is shut off a
laptop<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> battery<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.820> of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
laptop and take out the battery and of

course take out the AC adapter and the
first<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> remove

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
first thing we're going to do is remove

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
first thing we're going to do is remove
these<00:01:23.670> pegs<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:25.049> skip<00:01:25.380> any<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
these pegs so don't skip any and you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.149 
these pegs so don't skip any and you
just<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> screwdriver<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.860> pry<00:01:28.860> them<00:01:28.979> off

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
just take a screwdriver and pry them off

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.990 
just take a screwdriver and pry them off
like<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:31.229> should<00:01:31.409> look<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
like so it should look like that so now

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.420 
like so it should look like that so now
you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> unscrew<00:01:36.990> each<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.009> screws

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you have to unscrew each of these screws

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.230 
you have to unscrew each of these screws
underneath<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.810> pegs<00:01:40.909> here's<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
underneath all the pegs here's what the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
underneath all the pegs here's what the
screws<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.470> don't<00:01:43.890> get

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
screws look like so you don't get

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.640 
screws look like so you don't get
confused

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.300 

now<00:01:51.010> you<00:01:51.130> just<00:01:51.250> have<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.580> snap<00:01:52.060> off<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.330> bezel

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
now you just have to snap off the bezel

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.010 
now you just have to snap off the bezel
it<00:01:54.310> might<00:01:54.520> take<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.790> little<00:01:55.000> bit<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.390> force<00:01:55.630> but

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it might take a little bit of force but

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.920 
it might take a little bit of force but
you<00:01:56.620> know<00:01:56.920> just<00:01:57.270> try<00:01:58.270> not<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.540> use<00:01:58.660> too<00:01:58.900> much

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
you know just try not to use too much

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.140 
you know just try not to use too much
force<00:01:59.350> you<00:02:00.100> don't<00:02:00.250> want<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.490> accidentally

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
force you don't want to accidentally

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.260 
force you don't want to accidentally
break<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.510> or<00:02:01.600> anything<00:02:01.780> like<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.000> here

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
break it or anything like that so here

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.270 
break it or anything like that so here
we<00:02:04.390> go<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:04.810> still<00:02:05.320> taking<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.770> off<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
we go just still taking it off and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.590 
we go just still taking it off and
eventually<00:02:07.180> we'll<00:02:07.420> get<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:10.090> around<00:02:10.240> all

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
eventually we'll get it go around all

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.780 
eventually we'll get it go around all
the<00:02:10.780> corners<00:02:11.140> as<00:02:11.380> well<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> bottom<00:02:14.790> so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the corners as well as on the bottom so

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.360 
the corners as well as on the bottom so
again<00:02:16.090> no<00:02:16.300> rush<00:02:16.600> take<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.410> time<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:18.070> this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
again no rush take your time here this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.840 
again no rush take your time here this
is<00:02:18.520> probably<00:02:18.760> one<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> longest<00:02:19.570> steps<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
is probably one of the longest steps and

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.550 
is probably one of the longest steps and
eventually<00:02:25.360> you'll<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.110> here's<00:02:26.410> what

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
eventually you'll get it so here's what

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.130 
eventually you'll get it so here's what
it<00:02:26.650> looks<00:02:26.830> like<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.460> bezel<00:02:27.640> off<00:02:28.140> again

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
it looks like with the bezel off again

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.560 
it looks like with the bezel off again
we<00:02:29.380> have<00:02:29.530> more<00:02:29.770> screws<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> left<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
we have more screws on the left on the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.920 
we have more screws on the left on the
top<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.850> right<00:02:34.090> side<00:02:34.330> there<00:02:34.600> as<00:02:34.720> well

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
top and on the right side there as well

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.200 
top and on the right side there as well
and<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.770> unscrew<00:02:36.430> reach<00:02:36.880> those

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
and you just have to unscrew reach those

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.600 
and you just have to unscrew reach those
to<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.020> screen<00:02:38.320> out<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.600> laptop<00:02:41.610> so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
to get the screen out of the laptop so

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
to get the screen out of the laptop so
after<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.940> unscrew<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.990> look<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.650> that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
after you unscrew it you look like that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.550 
after you unscrew it you look like that
and<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.460> pull<00:02:45.700> out<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.720> power<00:02:47.050> cable

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and you have to pull out the power cable

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.240 
and you have to pull out the power cable
on<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.400> top<00:02:48.640> very<00:02:49.120> carefully<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.970> eventually

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
on the top very carefully and eventually

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.140 
on the top very carefully and eventually
you'll<00:02:54.250> get<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:55.230> here's<00:02:56.230> what<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.530> looks<00:02:56.739> like

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.170 

okay<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.180> after<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.989> remove<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.410> power<00:03:02.709> cable

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
okay so after you remove the power cable

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.380 
okay so after you remove the power cable
you<00:03:04.180> need<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.540> remove<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.959> data<00:03:05.170> cable<00:03:06.390> here's

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.700 

and<00:04:13.910> rescrew<00:04:14.910> everything<00:04:15.360> in<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:22.139> once<00:04:22.560> you

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
and rescrew everything in so once you

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.260 
and rescrew everything in so once you
get<00:04:22.830> everything<00:04:23.130> screwed<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.970> want<00:04:24.150> to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.850 
just do a basic test to make sure
everything<00:04:26.730> works<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.690> quickly<00:04:28.320> powering<00:04:28.770> it

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
everything works so quickly powering it

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.830

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
everything is running as it should again

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.640 
everything is running as it should again
it's<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.450> new<00:04:36.690> screen<00:04:37.050> with<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.320> higher

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
it's this is a new screen with a higher

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.409 
it's this is a new screen with a higher
resolution<00:04:37.950> that's<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> whole<00:04:39.030> reason<00:04:39.060> we

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
resolution that's the whole reason we

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.480 
resolution that's the whole reason we
replaced<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.710> should<00:04:41.070> see<00:04:41.750> 1600<00:04:42.750> x<00:04:43.200> 900

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
replaced it so you should see 1600 x 900
