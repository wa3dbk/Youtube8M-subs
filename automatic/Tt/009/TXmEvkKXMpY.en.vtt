filled that in now i can unlock the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030 
filled that in now i can unlock the
transparency<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:40.350> those<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.740> who<00:01:40.920> don't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
transparency for those of you who don't

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
know what that does essentially if you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.920 
know what that does essentially if you
couldn't<00:01:43.829> tell<00:01:43.860> already<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.180> stopped<00:01:45.659> me

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
couldn't tell already it just stopped me

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.300 
couldn't tell already it just stopped me
from<00:01:46.020> being<00:01:46.110> able<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.560> color<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> entire

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
from being able to color the entire

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.660 
from being able to color the entire
screen<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> okay<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> on

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
screen like that okay so with that on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.340 
screen like that okay so with that on
wherever<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.759> color<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.659> only<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> fill

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
wherever I color it's only going to fill

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.810 
wherever I color it's only going to fill
in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.979> area<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.460> already<00:01:53.790> colored<00:01:54.500> okay

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
in the area that's already colored okay

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.459 
in the area that's already colored okay
so<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.170> what
