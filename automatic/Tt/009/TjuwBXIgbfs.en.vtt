00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.800

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.559
 video on how to stop the motorcycle explaining 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 better as it back to neutral 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.420
 and the time is right to return one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.699
 march, thanks guys I'm going to start my 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:32.399
 first as getting back on track, right? 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:35.850
 the turn around there ó ó 1ª 2ª 3ª good since 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.280
 You want to stop at the curb right will 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.730
 do to the part when a Brazil to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 low ocean does not need is is a buffalo is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.030
 to slow down and then taught it is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.030
 with time it's 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.280
 for your rearview mirror, only 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.280
 helmet 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.550
 then cec reduced one hour more 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.640
 when you arrive by car agile and very calm 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.640
 there 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.290
 ae oak good son I'm not a guy 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 yes helmet keeping crazy see then 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.110
 Okay, let's separate the part 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.869
 Brazil one down down and leaves 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.310
 in the first one it can be seen that the first 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.619
 If you enter slowly, go 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.020
 training together what you do now is the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.030
 Part Brazil at the most and I said look, go. 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.850
 Brother year until you can get your foot in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.009
 left on the ground never puts the right 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.729
 What you need the money is braking 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.979
 for a motorcycle, it was then basically the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.990
 who accelerated tightening the clutch will 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.060
 braking and put the left foot to stop 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.479
 beauty and then the first march wants to come back 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.390
 neutral sends gap home as well 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.660
 from light to so the op looked like the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.930
 whiting again here is a first O 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.010
 enzyme and then saw again 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.010
 technically leave 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.310
 So it's a good way, did not you? 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.630

 I already did a video how to reduce gears 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.770

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.460
