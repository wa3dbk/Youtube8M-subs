popped up on a few online stores but

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.090 
popped up on a few online stores but
they've<00:00:20.340> sold<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.820> incredibly<00:00:21.510> fast<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.140> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and but needless to say they'll probably

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.689 
and but needless to say they'll probably
start<00:00:27.900> hitting<00:00:28.230> hard<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.890> pretty<00:00:29.250> soon<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
start hitting hard and pretty soon and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
start hitting hard and pretty soon and
then<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> want<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.349> guys<00:00:31.590> then

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
honestly go out and get them because

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.090 
honestly go out and get them because
they<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.660> probably<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> coolest

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
they are probably some of the coolest

potshots at the squid-like droids that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450 
potshots at the squid-like droids that
London<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.449> Kamino<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.250> guy

London on Kamino and we see this guy

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
London on Kamino and we see this guy
rushing<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> help<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> arc<00:01:00.660> troopers<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> by

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
rushing to help the arc troopers and by

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
rushing to help the arc troopers and by
mounting<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.699> rocket<00:01:03.210> launcher<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.750> his

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
mounting a rocket launcher on his

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
mounting a rocket launcher on his

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
shoulder and firing a missile at the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.550 
shoulder and firing a missile at the
droids<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.930> land<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.439> Kamino<00:01:07.979> city<00:01:09.409> this<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
droids that land on Kamino city this is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
droids that land on Kamino city this is
probably<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> coolest<00:01:11.310> after

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
probably one of the coolest after

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.980 
probably one of the coolest after
trooper<00:01:12.390> repin<00:01:12.810> staff<00:01:13.200> seen<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.680> far<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
trooper repin staff seen so far and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
trooper repin staff seen so far and
there's<00:01:15.990> nothing<00:01:16.290> special<00:01:16.619> about<00:01:16.890> him<00:01:17.220> really

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
there's nothing special about him really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.429 
there's nothing special about him really
but<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> deco<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> they've<00:01:19.080> given

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
but I think the deco that they've given

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.350 
but I think the deco that they've given
this<00:01:19.590> guy<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.700> sets<00:01:20.939> him<00:01:21.030> aside<00:01:21.330> from

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this guy it really sets him aside from

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
this guy it really sets him aside from
some<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> other<00:01:22.200> oft<00:01:22.380> troopers<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
some of the other oft troopers and I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.390 
some of the other oft troopers and I
think<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.270> said<00:01:24.720> did<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.860> his<00:01:26.100> style

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
think that said did you know his style

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.830 
think that said did you know his style
of<00:01:26.670> troopers<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> only

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
of troopers are probably the only

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.560 
of troopers are probably the only
figures<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:29.119> there's<00:01:30.119> standout

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
figures really that there's standout

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.530 
figures really that there's standout
aside<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.229> guy<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.180> I'll<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.450> on

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
aside from this guy and so I'll get on

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
aside from this guy and so I'll get on
to<00:01:33.570> why<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> figure<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.590> much<00:01:34.799> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to why I like this figure so much in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
to why I like this figure so much in
just<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.220> moment<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.960> first<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.079> we're<00:01:37.200> gonna

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
just a moment and first up we're gonna

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
just a moment and first up we're gonna
take<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> packaging<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.670> comes

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
take a look at the packaging that comes

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
take a look at the packaging that comes
in<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.689> these<00:01:39.869> new<00:01:40.079> Clone<00:01:40.350> Wars<00:01:40.380> figures<00:01:40.829> have

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
in now these new Clone Wars figures have

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
in now these new Clone Wars figures have
