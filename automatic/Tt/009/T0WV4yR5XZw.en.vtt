when<00:00:04.850> the<00:00:04.939> Breville<00:00:05.240> designers<00:00:05.779> set<00:00:06.439> about

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
when the Breville designers set about

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.070 
when the Breville designers set about
making<00:00:07.129> this<00:00:07.220> espresso<00:00:07.520> machine<00:00:07.790> they<00:00:08.750> didn't

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
making this espresso machine they didn't

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.140 
making this espresso machine they didn't
take<00:00:09.259> their<00:00:09.469> cues<00:00:09.860> from<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.370> domestic<00:00:10.730> market

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
take their cues from the domestic market

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.839 
take their cues from the domestic market
what<00:00:11.690> they<00:00:11.900> did<00:00:12.139> was<00:00:12.349> they<00:00:12.860> went<00:00:13.070> out<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:13.460> they

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
what they did was they went out and they

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.579 
what they did was they went out and they
took<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:14.269> best<00:00:14.450> from<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:14.870> commercial<00:00:15.379> world

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
took the best from the commercial world

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.830 
took the best from the commercial world
and<00:00:15.860> thought<00:00:16.400> about<00:00:16.430> how<00:00:16.880> can<00:00:17.150> we<00:00:17.300> take<00:00:17.390> these

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
and thought about how can we take these

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.080 
and thought about how can we take these
features<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:18.619> put<00:00:19.160> them<00:00:19.340> in<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:19.730> domestic

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090
