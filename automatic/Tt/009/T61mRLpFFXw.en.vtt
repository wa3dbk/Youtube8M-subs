moment I thought it might be helpful if
I<00:00:12.300> make<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> couple<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.080> videos<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> help

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I make a couple of videos just to help

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.730 
I make a couple of videos just to help
out<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.240> show<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> knit<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.500> use

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
out and show you how I knit with use

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.310 
out and show you how I knit with use
yarns<00:00:17.340> we'll<00:00:18.060> start<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.390> ribbon<00:00:18.750> yarn<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
yarns we'll start with ribbon yarn and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
yarns we'll start with ribbon yarn and
first<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.730> would<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.029> helpful<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.480> think

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
first of all it would be helpful I think

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.179 
first of all it would be helpful I think
if<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.900> look<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> construction<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
if we look at the construction of the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
if we look at the construction of the
yarn<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.590> helps<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
yarn so you can see how that helps to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.259 
yarn so you can see how that helps to
knit<00:00:26.810> you've<00:00:27.810> basically<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> ribbon<00:00:28.859> with

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
knit you've basically got a ribbon with

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.080 
knit you've basically got a ribbon with
slots<00:00:30.269> running<00:00:31.199> across<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> top<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.700> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
slots running across the top and it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.720 
slots running across the top and it's
these<00:00:33.329> slots<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.170> knit<00:00:34.469> into<00:00:34.739> when

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
these slots that you knit into when

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
these slots that you knit into when
you're<00:00:35.910> knitting<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> ribbon<00:00:36.899> yarn<00:00:37.399> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you're knitting with the ribbon yarn so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
you're knitting with the ribbon yarn so
to<00:00:38.460> cast<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.629> your<00:00:39.840> needles<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to cast on take your needles this is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
to cast on take your needles this is
