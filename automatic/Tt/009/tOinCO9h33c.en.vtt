the reload time got a problem there the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.880 
the reload time got a problem there the
m416<00:01:36.920> has<00:01:37.810> significantly<00:01:38.810> shorter<00:01:39.440> reload

m416 has significantly shorter reload

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.610 
m416 has significantly shorter reload
time<00:01:40.190> both<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:41.210> long<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.900> short<00:01:41.930> reload

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.970 
time both the long and the short reload
time<00:01:42.920> as<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.910> can<00:01:44.060> see<00:01:44.240> at<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.390> eight<00:01:44.980> 1.85

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
time as you can see at the eight 1.85

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.890 
time as you can see at the eight 1.85
and<00:01:46.520> 2.4<00:01:47.360> while<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.110> l85<00:01:48.590> got<00:01:48.850> 275<00:01:49.900> over

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
and 2.4 while on the l85 got 275 over

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.080 
and 2.4 while on the l85 got 275 over
like<00:01:51.260> a<00:01:51.290> second<00:01:51.950> slower<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.380> 375<00:01:54.490> that's<00:01:55.490> like

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
like a second slower and 375 that's like

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.850 
like a second slower and 375 that's like
one<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.510> half<00:01:56.750> seconds<00:01:57.170> slower<00:01:57.470> so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
one and a half seconds slower so

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.970 
one and a half seconds slower so
definitely<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:59.210> m416<00:01:59.900> has<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.320> really<00:02:00.740> good

of recoil the equal left/right recall is
the<00:02:17.510> worst<00:02:17.780> because<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.170> don't<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.830> where

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
the worst because you don't know where

Rico<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:36.040> lot<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.840> first<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.260> wrinkle

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
Rico is a lot the first of all wrinkle

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.460 
Rico is a lot the first of all wrinkle
is<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> little<00:02:39.100> bit<00:02:39.190> better<00:02:39.459> than<00:02:39.790> 1.5<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:41.290> it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
is a little bit better than 1.5 but it's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.490 
is a little bit better than 1.5 but it's
still<00:02:41.830> bad<00:02:42.459> it's<00:02:42.820> not<00:02:43.150> good<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> recoil

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
still bad it's not good it's the recoil

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.280 
still bad it's not good it's the recoil
is<00:02:44.740> horrendous<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> la-5<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.990> want

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
is horrendous on the la-5 and don't want

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.190 
is horrendous on the la-5 and don't want
to<00:02:47.560> make<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> video<00:02:48.580> really<00:02:48.970> long<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:49.900> were

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
to make this video really long but were

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.460 
to make this video really long but were
the<00:02:50.470> early<00:02:50.950> 5<00:02:51.160> action<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.640> kinda<00:02:52.060> better<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.569> as

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
the early 5 action is kinda better is as

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.880 
the early 5 action is kinda better is as
you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.739> see<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.370> ABS<00:02:55.020> spread<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.680> move

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
you can see the ABS spread on the move

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.910 
you can see the ABS spread on the move
so<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.550> has<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> better<00:02:58.090> spread<00:02:58.810> while<00:02:59.260> shooting

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
so it has a better spread while shooting

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.090 
so it has a better spread while shooting
and<00:03:00.310> moving<00:03:00.850> at<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.180> same<00:03:01.420> time<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.170> also<00:03:02.769> has

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
and moving at the same time and also has

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.130 
and moving at the same time and also has
a<00:03:03.340> better<00:03:03.930> hipfire<00:03:04.930> spread<00:03:05.670> also<00:03:06.670> has<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.140> 2.25

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
a better hipfire spread also has a 2.25

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.870 
a better hipfire spread also has a 2.25
when<00:03:08.560> you're<00:03:08.769> standing<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.430> three<00:03:09.640> point

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
when you're standing at three point

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.449 
when you're standing at three point
three<00:03:09.970> seven<00:03:10.540> five<00:03:11.080> while<00:03:11.950> you're<00:03:12.130> standing

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
three seven five while you're standing

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.699 
three seven five while you're standing
and<00:03:12.880> moving<00:03:13.239> at<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.660> same<00:03:13.959> time<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.500> hip

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
and moving at the same time and hip

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.640 
and moving at the same time and hip
firing<00:03:15.070> so<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> guess<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.510> l85<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> weapon

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
firing so I guess the l85 is a weapon

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.920 
firing so I guess the l85 is a weapon
that<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.950> will<00:03:18.190> use<00:03:18.519> in<00:03:18.880> full<00:03:19.180> auto<00:03:19.480> in

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
that you will use in full auto in

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.880 
that you will use in full auto in
close-quarters<00:03:20.709> situations<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:22.390> m416<00:03:23.170> has

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
close-quarters situations the m416 has

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.220 
close-quarters situations the m416 has
everything<00:03:24.580> else<00:03:24.940> better<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.690> recoil<00:03:26.110> is

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
everything else better the recoil is

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.940 
everything else better the recoil is
better<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:28.180> reload<00:03:28.810> time<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:29.079> better<00:03:29.440> so

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
better and the reload time is better so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.160 
better and the reload time is better so
the<00:03:30.549> winner<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:31.090> one<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.420> definitely<00:03:31.660> aim

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the winner of this one is definitely aim

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.009 
the winner of this one is definitely aim
for<00:03:32.500> 16<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.250> l85<00:03:33.760> was<00:03:34.060> comparable<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.720> the

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
for 16 the l85 was comparable to the

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.090 
for 16 the l85 was comparable to the
f2000<00:03:36.030> pre<00:03:37.030> nerf<00:03:37.390> but<00:03:38.079> now<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.560> it's<00:03:38.739> nerve

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
f2000 pre nerf but now that it's nerve

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.630 
f2000 pre nerf but now that it's nerve
it's<00:03:39.670> not<00:03:39.970> even<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.600> competition<00:03:41.489> against<00:03:42.489> the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
it's not even a competition against the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's not even a competition against the
ace23<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.930> m416<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.640> definitely<00:03:46.150> guys<00:03:46.450> if

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
ace23 and the m416 so definitely guys if

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.340 
ace23 and the m416 so definitely guys if
you<00:03:47.170> want<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.799> use<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:47.980> weapon<00:03:48.250> around<00:03:48.820> 6<00:03:49.350> 750

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
you want to use a weapon around 6 750

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.180 
you want to use a weapon around 6 750
rpm<00:03:50.670> definitely<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.880> for<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.299> m416<00:03:53.049> or<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
rpm definitely go for the m416 or the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.370 
rpm definitely go for the m416 or the
ace23<00:03:54.610> for<00:03:55.269> better<00:03:55.570> close<00:03:55.959> quarters

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
ace23 for better close quarters

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380 
ace23 for better close quarters
encounters<00:03:56.920> if<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.640> want<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:57.970> go<00:03:58.150> really

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
encounters if you want to go really

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.569 
encounters if you want to go really
close<00:03:58.600> quarters<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.709> can<00:03:59.739> either<00:04:00.070> use<00:04:00.400> the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
close quarters you can either use the

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.880 
close quarters you can either use the
AEK<00:04:01.000> or<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> f2000<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:02.170> don't<00:04:02.500> recommend

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
AEK or the f2000 so I don't recommend

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.240 
AEK or the f2000 so I don't recommend
using<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.340> l85<00:04:04.120> because<00:04:04.630> it's<00:04:05.230> not<00:04:05.590> that<00:04:05.920> good

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
using the l85 because it's not that good

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.069 
using the l85 because it's not that good
aside<00:04:06.760> from<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.120> fact<00:04:07.329> that<00:04:07.480> has<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> really

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
aside from the fact that has a really

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.280 
aside from the fact that has a really
nice<00:04:08.350> spread<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.610> move<00:04:09.820> it's<00:04:10.420> more<00:04:10.720> it's<00:04:11.140> a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
nice spread on the move it's more it's a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.650 
nice spread on the move it's more it's a
more<00:04:11.530> mobile<00:04:12.040> weapon<00:04:12.489> it's<00:04:12.850> more<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.420> the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
more mobile weapon it's more like the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.039 
more mobile weapon it's more like the
f2000<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.590> f2000<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:15.310> still<00:04:15.700> better<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.750> um

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
f2000 the f2000 is still better so um

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.840 
f2000 the f2000 is still better so um
that<00:04:17.530> was<00:04:17.560> about<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:18.070> for<00:04:18.250> today<00:04:18.430> guys<00:04:18.609> that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
that was about it for today guys that

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.810 
that was about it for today guys that
don't<00:04:19.060> want<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.600> drag<00:04:20.229> those<00:04:20.470> videos<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.760> a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820
