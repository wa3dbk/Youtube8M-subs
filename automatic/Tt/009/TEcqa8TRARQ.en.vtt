this<00:00:01.680> marvelous<00:00:02.460> flapping<00:00:03.090> bird<00:00:03.330> has<00:00:03.810> been

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
this marvelous flapping bird has been

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.110 
this marvelous flapping bird has been
made<00:00:04.410> by<00:00:04.710> children<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.250> Japan<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> last

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
made by children in Japan for the last

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.519 
made by children in Japan for the last
300<00:00:06.540> years

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
300 years

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.370 
300 years
take<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> square<00:00:08.519> piece<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:09.030> paper<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.540> fold<00:00:09.599> a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
take a square piece of paper and fold a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100 
take a square piece of paper and fold a
Kris<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.730> cross<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
Kris and a cross is like a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
Kris and a cross is like a
multiplication<00:00:13.799> sign<00:00:14.190> then<00:00:14.940> upturn<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
multiplication sign then upturn the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960 
multiplication sign then upturn the
paper<00:00:15.750> for<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.920> minus<00:00:17.340> sign

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
paper for the minus sign

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.870 
paper for the minus sign
open<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> paper<00:00:19.199> rotated<00:00:20.010> by<00:00:20.189> quarter<00:00:20.670> turn

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
open the paper rotated by quarter turn

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.109 
open the paper rotated by quarter turn
and<00:00:21.119> fold<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> plus<00:00:22.050> sign<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> squash

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and fold a plus sign and then you squash

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.300 
and fold a plus sign and then you squash
the<00:00:24.420> paper<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:27.689> becomes<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.529> quarter

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the paper so that it becomes a quarter

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.010 
the paper so that it becomes a quarter
of<00:00:29.519> its<00:00:29.820> origin<00:00:30.420> size<00:00:30.710> now<00:00:32.059> fold<00:00:33.059> two

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of its origin size now fold two

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.240 
of its origin size now fold two
triangles<00:00:34.700> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.290> diagonal<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.829> fold

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
triangles on the diagonal and then fold

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.090 
triangles on the diagonal and then fold
the<00:00:38.460> head<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.420> would<00:00:39.719> become<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> Cobra's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the head it would become like a Cobra's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.080 
the head it would become like a Cobra's
head<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.730> us<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.300> hood<00:00:43.219> do<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> same<00:00:44.640> now

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.479 

reverse<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.430> paper<00:00:55.930> once<00:00:56.930> again<00:00:57.340> fold<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
reverse the paper once again fold the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.320 
reverse the paper once again fold the
two<00:00:58.640> triangles<00:00:59.440> and<00:01:00.440> then<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.330> triangular

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
two triangles and then the triangular

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.770 
two triangles and then the triangular
crown<00:01:04.000> open<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:05.120> up<00:01:06.280> lift<00:01:07.280> both<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.180> triangles
