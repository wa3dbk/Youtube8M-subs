so<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.930> could<00:01:31.110> have<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> massive

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so one back could have got an a massive

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.670 
so one back could have got an a massive
critical<00:01:33.090> hit<00:01:33.329> combo<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.960> him<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> looks<00:01:34.560> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
critical hit combo on him it looks like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
critical hit combo on him it looks like
one<00:01:34.799> bat<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> guy<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
one bat did just that because the guy is

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
one bat did just that because the guy is
running<00:01:36.810> away<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.650> him<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.950> he<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.490> has<00:01:38.759> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
running away from him and he only has a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819 
running away from him and he only has a
wooden<00:01:39.210> axe<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.110> absolutely<00:01:40.680> insane

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
wooden axe that was absolutely insane

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
from one bat let's see if he can now run
all<00:01:43.290> over<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> kill<00:01:44.430> looks<00:01:44.909> like

this guy who keeps on coming after him
so<00:02:02.430> let's<00:02:02.579> see<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.790> one<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.240> pick<00:02:03.390> off

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so let's see if one that can pick off

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
so let's see if one that can pick off
the<00:02:03.630> kill<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.140> reckon<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the kill here I reckon he can do it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.080 
the kill here I reckon he can do it
let's<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.460> he<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.820> he<00:02:05.909> comes

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
let's see if he can do it he comes

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
let's see if he can do it he comes
around<00:02:06.180> gets<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> few<00:02:06.810> hits<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> guy<00:02:07.530> tried

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
around gets a few hits and the guy tried

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
around gets a few hits and the guy tried
to<00:02:07.799> flint<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.220> steel<00:02:08.399> him<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.970> did<00:02:09.149> not

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to flint and steel him but that did not

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.089 
to flint and steel him but that did not
work<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.750> too<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.619> well<00:02:10.830> but

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
work out too well for them as well but

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.979 
work out too well for them as well but
now<00:02:11.280> makes<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.670> break<00:02:11.879> away<00:02:12.060> from<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.660> looks

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
now makes the break away from them looks

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
now makes the break away from them looks
like<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.290> ate<00:02:13.379> some

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
like you just ate some

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
like you just ate some
chicken<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.280> don't<00:02:14.580> know<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> good

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
chicken I don't know if that was a good

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.760 
chicken I don't know if that was a good
strategy<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.410> he<00:02:16.560> could<00:02:16.680> have

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
strategy or not because he could have

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.590 
strategy or not because he could have
got<00:02:16.860> poisoning<00:02:17.340> from<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.420> looks<00:02:18.570> like

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
got poisoning from that so it looks like

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.060 
got poisoning from that so it looks like
there's<00:02:18.870> some<00:02:18.990> gear<00:02:19.200> inside<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> water<00:02:19.890> which

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
there's some gear inside the water which

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.590 
there's some gear inside the water which
he<00:02:20.190> has<00:02:20.310> not<00:02:20.580> seen<00:02:20.880> look<00:02:21.090> someone<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:21.480> killed

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
he has not seen look someone got killed

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.480 
he has not seen look someone got killed
off<00:02:21.780> earlier<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.890> actually<00:02:23.160> has<00:02:23.460> a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
off earlier which is actually has a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.190 
off earlier which is actually has a
change<00:02:23.760> has<00:02:23.940> play<00:02:24.090> inside<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:25.020> that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
change has play inside there as one that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.050 
change has play inside there as one that
comes<00:02:25.350> over<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.620> gets<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.950> nice<00:02:26.250> hit<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.730> him

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
comes over and gets a nice hit on him

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.460 
comes over and gets a nice hit on him
coming<00:02:27.570> around<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> corner<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.350> looks

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
coming around the corner here it looks

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.660 
coming around the corner here it looks
like<00:02:28.590> he's<00:02:28.710> chasing<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.100> looks<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.400> he<00:02:29.520> got

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
like he's chasing it looks like he got

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.640 
like he's chasing it looks like he got
another<00:02:30.000> nice<00:02:30.270> critical<00:02:30.690> hit<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.470> looks

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
another nice critical hit and it looks

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320 
another nice critical hit and it looks
like<00:02:31.740> he's<00:02:31.950> gonna<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.220> chasing<00:02:32.400> him<00:02:32.610> after<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
like he's gonna be chasing him after and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.150 
like he's gonna be chasing him after and
it<00:02:33.720> looks<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.320> badge<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.740> picked<00:02:35.010> off

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
it looks like one badge is picked off

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.370 
it looks like one badge is picked off
the<00:02:35.550> kill<00:02:35.760> he<00:02:35.940> was<00:02:36.090> completely<00:02:36.510> understand

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the kill he was completely understand

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
the kill he was completely understand
against<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.950> stacked<00:02:38.370> guy<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:39.180> was

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
against a stacked guy that was

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.960

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
absolutely crazy GG to one bat for that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.630 
absolutely crazy GG to one bat for that
kill<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.570> was<00:02:42.750> absolutely<00:02:42.959> insane<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.430> long

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
