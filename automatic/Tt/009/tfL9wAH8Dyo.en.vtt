00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
starts but this is pretty much unique

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.240 
starts but this is pretty much unique
circles<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.739> an<00:02:10.860> incline

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
circles so actually going up an incline

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.830 
circles so actually going up an incline
we've<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:11.970> you've<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> traction<00:02:12.630> we've

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
we've got you've got the traction we've

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.920 
we've got you've got the traction we've
got<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.019> talk<00:02:13.230> pushing<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> hill<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.810> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
got the talk pushing up the hill this is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
got the talk pushing up the hill this is
the<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.890> one-off<00:02:23.340> titanium<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.640> made

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
the the one-off titanium and it's made

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
the the one-off titanium and it's made
by<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.600> guy<00:02:27.930> called<00:02:27.959> micros<00:02:28.680> burger<00:02:29.070> down<00:02:29.910> in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
by a guy called micros burger down in

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.470 
by a guy called micros burger down in
Massachusetts<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.480> he's<00:02:35.239> assured<00:02:36.239> that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
Massachusetts and he's assured that

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
Massachusetts and he's assured that
there<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> need<00:02:36.930> thought<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.560> people<00:02:37.860> with

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there was a need thought for people with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.120 
there was a need thought for people with
disabilities<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> handbrake<00:02:40.890> that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
disabilities to have a handbrake that

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.699 
disabilities to have a handbrake that
can<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:42.329> know<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.930> take<00:02:43.170> some

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
can do you know can really take some

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.759 
can do you know can really take some
quite<00:02:43.890> severe<00:02:44.190> terrain<00:02:44.570> not<00:02:45.590> made<00:02:46.590> for

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
quite severe terrain not made for

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.699 
quite severe terrain not made for
downhill<00:02:47.420> there's<00:02:48.420> there's<00:02:48.750> full<00:02:49.019> wheel<00:02:49.230> hand

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
downhill there's there's full wheel hand

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.020 
downhill there's there's full wheel hand
backed<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.100> there<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.400> made<00:02:50.549> specifically

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
backed up there that made specifically

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.140 
backed up there that made specifically
for<00:02:51.120> downhill<00:02:51.360> which<00:02:52.049> are<00:02:52.200> awesome<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
for downhill which are awesome but it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
for downhill which are awesome but it
don't<00:02:54.269> have<00:02:54.420> any<00:02:54.600> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.900> crank<00:02:55.380> shift<00:02:55.650> or

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
don't have any kind of crank shift or

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.520 
don't have any kind of crank shift or
Drive<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.870> is<00:02:57.989> pretty<00:02:58.170> much<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> only

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
Drive and this is pretty much the only

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
Drive and this is pretty much the only
food<00:02:59.310> tray<00:02:59.579> off-road<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:01.140> bike<00:03:02.840> capable<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
food tray off-road and bike capable of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.509 
food tray off-road and bike capable of
getting<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> Train<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:05.130> got<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> hand

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
getting up the Train that's got a hand

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.090 
getting up the Train that's got a hand
drive<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.989> cost<00:03:07.470> five<00:03:07.739> thousand

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
drive on it this cost five thousand

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:18.330 
drive on it this cost five thousand
dress

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:04:27.070 

so<00:03:43.390> basically<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.890> can<00:03:52.040> get<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:26.750> take<00:04:26.930> your

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
so basically you can get to take your

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020 
so basically you can get to take your
hands<00:04:27.380> off<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.530> pedals<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.190> reach<00:04:28.640> for<00:04:28.910> their

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
hands off the pedals and reach for their

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.270 
hands off the pedals and reach for their
so<00:04:29.870> Hana<00:04:30.050> bias<00:04:30.320> means<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.010> can<00:04:31.190> only

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
so Hana bias means that you can only

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.280 
so Hana bias means that you can only
lose<00:04:31.580> quite<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.910> bit<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:32.180> momentum<00:04:33.050> because

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
lose quite a bit of momentum because

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.500 
lose quite a bit of momentum because
we're<00:04:33.500> only<00:04:33.560> pushing<00:04:33.950> with<00:04:34.070> one<00:04:34.220> hand

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
we're only pushing with one hand

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.050 
we're only pushing with one hand
what<00:04:36.140> this<00:04:36.290> bike<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.640> chest<00:04:37.910> plate

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
what this bike this is the chest plate

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.780 
what this bike this is the chest plate
here<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.420> supports<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.900> chest<00:04:39.640> that<00:04:40.640> can

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
here that supports a chest that can

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.630 
here that supports a chest that can
actually<00:04:40.910> steer<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.420> wheels<00:04:41.630> when<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.050> leave

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
actually steer the wheels when you leave

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.760 
actually steer the wheels when you leave
so<00:04:43.640> when<00:04:44.210> you're<00:04:44.300> pedaling<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.290> mean<00:04:45.500> to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
so when you're pedaling you can mean to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.380 
so when you're pedaling you can mean to
one<00:04:45.920> side<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.370> steer<00:04:46.640> that<00:04:46.760> way<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.360> can

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
one side and steer that way and you can

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.090 
one side and steer that way and you can
move<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.750> one<00:04:47.870> side<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.200> stay<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.500> way<00:04:48.650> which

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
move to one side and stay that way which

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.320 
move to one side and stay that way which
means<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.830> crankset<00:04:52.340> rather<00:04:52.730> than<00:04:53.000> losing

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
means to the crankset rather than losing

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.170 
means to the crankset rather than losing
momentum<00:04:54.340> balance<00:04:55.340> taking<00:04:55.520> hands<00:04:55.700> off<00:04:55.910> and

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
momentum balance taking hands off and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.630 
momentum balance taking hands off and
steer<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.830> that's<00:04:57.980> pretty<00:04:58.220> good<00:04:58.400> that's

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
steer and that's pretty good that's

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:30.640 
steer and that's pretty good that's
that's<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.270> really<00:04:59.540> helpful<00:04:59.920> feature<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:30.620> you

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
that's a really helpful feature so you

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.730 
that's a really helpful feature so you
can<00:05:31.220> trapped<00:05:31.640> in<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:32.840> need<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.320> bike<00:05:33.530> to

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
can trapped in the need of the bike to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.150 
can trapped in the need of the bike to
get<00:05:34.160> over<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.550> one<00:05:34.640> side<00:05:34.850> when<00:05:35.720> he's<00:05:35.810> steering

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
get over and one side when he's steering

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.440 
get over and one side when he's steering
try<00:05:37.160> and<00:05:37.280> think<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.670> motorcycle<00:05:38.300> sidecar

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
try and think of a motorcycle sidecar

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.940 
try and think of a motorcycle sidecar
passenger<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.740> way<00:05:40.750> over<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.260> that's<00:05:42.740> quite

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
passenger the way over and that's quite

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.110 
passenger the way over and that's quite
a<00:05:42.980> good<00:05:43.130> analogy<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.610> make<00:05:43.760> because<00:05:43.910> you

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
a good analogy to make because you

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.270 
a good analogy to make because you
really<00:05:44.330> need<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.600> get<00:05:44.780> that<00:05:44.900> weight<00:05:45.110> over<00:05:45.280> to

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
really need to get that weight over to

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.910 
really need to get that weight over to
stop<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.730> come<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.060> come<00:05:47.270> up<00:05:47.450> it's<00:05:48.350> made<00:05:48.560> for

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
stop it come and come up it's made for

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.620 
stop it come and come up it's made for
being<00:05:49.040> able<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.280> go<00:05:49.430> up<00:05:49.580> here<00:05:49.850> it's<00:05:50.180> made<00:05:50.480> for

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
being able to go up here it's made for

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.130 
being able to go up here it's made for
rough<00:05:50.780> terrain

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
rough terrain

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.050 
rough terrain
now<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.530> wanted<00:05:51.770> something<00:05:51.980> that<00:05:52.250> they<00:05:52.910> can

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
now I wanted something that they can

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.760 
now I wanted something that they can
take<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.390> off<00:05:53.570> off<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:53.990> beaten<00:05:54.260> path<00:05:54.350> off

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
take you off off the beaten path off
