some books share you may look into and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
some books share you may look into and
make<00:00:17.880> sure<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.360> double<00:00:18.630> plain<00:00:18.900> John

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
make sure that it's a double plain John

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830 
make sure that it's a double plain John
and<00:00:19.800> just<00:00:20.160> way<00:00:20.310> too<00:00:20.369> however<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.060> clavicle

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and just way too however the clavicle

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.679 
and just way too however the clavicle
and<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> manubrium<00:00:22.349> and<00:00:23.599> articulations<00:00:24.599> are

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and the manubrium and articulations are

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
and the manubrium and articulations are
arranged<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.450> a<00:00:28.490> fibrous

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
arranged and so you have a fibrous

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.939 
arranged and so you have a fibrous
capsule<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.119> surrounds<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
capsule that surrounds and the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.570 
capsule that surrounds and the
sternoclavicular<00:00:32.400> joint<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.900> have<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
sternoclavicular joint so you have the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.580 
sternoclavicular joint so you have the
stone<00:00:35.580> of<00:00:35.610> facet<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> middle<00:00:36.809> end<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
stone of facet of the middle end of the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.340 
stone of facet of the middle end of the
clavicle<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.610> articulates<00:00:39.650> with<00:00:40.650> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
clavicle here articulates with the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
clavicle here articulates with the
clavicular<00:00:43.350> facet<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.120> curriculum

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
clavicular facet and the curriculum

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
clavicular facet and the curriculum
notch<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.559> manubrium<00:00:46.910> okay<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
notch of the manubrium okay it's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
notch of the manubrium okay it's
separated<00:00:48.450> by<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.809> disk<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> is

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
separated by a little disk so this is

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
separated by a little disk so this is
weird<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.640> look<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> outside

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
weird like I look like on the outside

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.930 
weird like I look like on the outside
and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> dissected<00:00:52.950> dissected

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and then this is a dissected dissected

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
and then this is a dissected dissected
version<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.170> you've<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:55.590> disk<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
version so you've got a little disk that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
version so you've got a little disk that
runs<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> inside<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.360> separated<00:00:58.320> by

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
runs on the inside and it's separated by

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.549 
runs on the inside and it's separated by
two<00:00:58.469> joint<00:00:59.070> cavities<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> it's

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
two joint cavities here and so it's

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
two joint cavities here and so it's
obvious<00:01:01.860> lined<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.370> son<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> fluids<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
obvious lined by son of your fluids so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.770 
obvious lined by son of your fluids so
the<00:01:03.989> clavicle<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.039> lined<00:01:05.369> by<00:01:05.780> fibrocartilage

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the clavicle is lined by fibrocartilage

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
the clavicle is lined by fibrocartilage
and<00:01:07.410> then<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.130> clavicular<00:01:08.610> notches

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and then the the clavicular notches

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.770 
and then the the clavicular notches
lined<00:01:09.539> by<00:01:09.780> hyaline<00:01:10.259> cartilage<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.690> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
lined by hyaline cartilage and so it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.410 
lined by hyaline cartilage and so it
stabilized<00:01:13.259> by<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.440> few<00:01:13.740> ligaments<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
stabilized by a few ligaments and so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.389 
stabilized by a few ligaments and so
superiorly<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.349> Midland<00:01:16.709> the<00:01:16.860> clavicle

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
superiorly on the Midland the clavicle

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.270 
superiorly on the Midland the clavicle
you've<00:01:17.849> got<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.200> inter<00:01:19.890> clavicular

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you've got the the inter clavicular

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
you've got the the inter clavicular
ligament<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:20.910> it<00:01:21.000> goes<00:01:21.149> along<00:01:21.599> the<00:01:21.810> top<00:01:22.050> here

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
ligament so it goes along the top here

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.589 
ligament so it goes along the top here
along<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.709> jugular<00:01:23.429> notch<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.060> unto<00:01:24.569> the

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:24.599 
along the jugular notch and unto the

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.650 
along the jugular notch and unto the
opposite<00:01:25.050> end<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.410> clavicle<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.660> so

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
opposite end of the clavicle and so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.540 
opposite end of the clavicle and so
you've<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:28.110> anterior<00:01:29.099> and<00:01:29.250> posterior

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
you've got an anterior and posterior

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.820 
you've got an anterior and posterior
sternoclavicular<00:01:30.539> ligament<00:01:31.289> so<00:01:31.380> auntie<00:01:31.800> I

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
sternoclavicular ligament so auntie I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.589 
sternoclavicular ligament so auntie I
mean<00:01:32.069> the<00:01:32.250> front<00:01:32.580> side<00:01:32.849> and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.149> paw<00:01:33.300> stay<00:01:33.509> on

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
mean the front side and the paw stay on

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:36.380 
mean the front side and the paw stay on
the<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.459> help<00:01:35.459> stabilize<00:01:35.970> joint

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the back and help stabilize joint

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.650 
the back and help stabilize joint
alongside<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.020> fibrous<00:01:37.440> capsule<00:01:37.709> and<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:39.539> got

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
alongside the fibrous capsule and we got

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.779 
alongside the fibrous capsule and we got
an<00:01:39.750> accessory<00:01:40.319> ligament<00:01:40.739> called<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> coastal

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
an accessory ligament called the coastal

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.570 
an accessory ligament called the coastal
clavicle<00:01:42.420> ligament<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.039> rises<00:01:44.220> from

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
clavicle ligament and so it rises from

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.260 
clavicle ligament and so it rises from
the<00:01:45.170> coastal<00:01:46.520> chondral<00:01:47.520> cartridge<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.209> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the coastal chondral cartridge and the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.320 
the coastal chondral cartridge and the
first<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.069> first<00:01:50.310> rib<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:51.030> under<00:01:51.239> the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
first in the first rib and under the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.809 
first in the first rib and under the
inferior<00:01:51.810> aspect<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.380> clavicle<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
inferior aspect the clavicle it's

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.699 
inferior aspect the clavicle it's
separated<00:01:54.360> by<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.630> bear<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.440> best

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
separated by a little bear so the best

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.190 
separated by a little bear so the best

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
vertebrae of cervical spine you also

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.780 
vertebrae of cervical spine you also
have<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.810> nerve<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.320> subclavian<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
have the nerve to the subclavian so the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.610 
have the nerve to the subclavian so the
most<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.480> subclavian<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:42.290> under<00:03:42.500> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
most the subclavian is under the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.789 
most the subclavian is under the
clavicle<00:03:43.040> here<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.489> sub<00:03:43.790> meaning<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.360> the

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
clavicle here so sub meaning and the

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.770 
clavicle here so sub meaning and the
clavicles<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.890> sub<00:03:46.190> Clavius<00:03:46.910> clavicle<00:03:47.570> and

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
clavicles a sub Clavius clavicle and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.220 
clavicles a sub Clavius clavicle and
then<00:03:48.769> there's<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.730> subclavian<00:03:50.120> sakshi<00:03:50.959> helps

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
then there's the subclavian sakshi helps

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.229 
then there's the subclavian sakshi helps
stabilize<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:52.040> clavicle<00:03:52.549> Joan<00:03:52.790> stir<00:03:53.060> and

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
stabilize the clavicle Joan stir and

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.860 
stabilize the clavicle Joan stir and
movement<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.810> pectoral<00:03:54.440> girdle<00:03:54.470> and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
movement to the pectoral girdle and

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.580 
movement to the pectoral girdle and
that's<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.049> function<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.799> muscle<00:03:58.040> and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
that's that function of that muscle and

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.020 
that's that function of that muscle and
so<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> few<00:04:00.890> things<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.280> can<00:04:01.459> go<00:04:01.489> wrong<00:04:01.640> with

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
so a few things that can go wrong with

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.729 
so a few things that can go wrong with
the<00:04:02.269> sternoclavicular<00:04:03.019> joint<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:03.590> got<00:04:03.620> a

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
the sternoclavicular joint you got a

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.470 
the sternoclavicular joint you got a
couple<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.100> dissipations<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.180> occur

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
couple of dissipations that it can occur

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.880 
couple of dissipations that it can occur
so<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.959> imagine<00:04:06.019> you've<00:04:06.350> got<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> direct

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
so if you imagine you've got a direct

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.160 
so if you imagine you've got a direct
force<00:04:07.190> from<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.519> shoulder<00:04:08.060> because<00:04:08.959> the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
force from the shoulder because the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.360 
force from the shoulder because the
clever<00:04:09.410> quality<00:04:09.769> collects<00:04:10.250> with

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
clever quality collects with

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.860 
clever quality collects with
acromioclavicular<00:04:10.760> joint<00:04:11.269> which<00:04:11.660> i'll

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
acromioclavicular joint which i'll

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.900 
acromioclavicular joint which i'll
explain<00:04:11.900> later<00:04:12.370> so<00:04:13.370> if<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.519> have<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.670> direct

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
explain later so if you have a direct

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.569 
explain later so if you have a direct
force<00:04:14.359> that<00:04:14.600> say<00:04:14.780> from<00:04:14.959> rugby<00:04:15.200> or<00:04:15.579> american

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
force that say from rugby or american

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.770 
force that say from rugby or american
football<00:04:17.030> something<00:04:17.329> like<00:04:17.419> that<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.690> you

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
football something like that and you

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.420 
football something like that and you
have<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.930> direct<00:04:18.289> force<00:04:18.620> going<00:04:19.100> through<00:04:19.280> the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
have a direct force going through the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.320 
have a direct force going through the
clavicle<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.870> can<00:04:21.079> also<00:04:21.229> be<00:04:21.380> from<00:04:21.859> a<00:04:22.330> fall

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
clavicle this can also be from a fall

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.690 
clavicle this can also be from a fall
we're<00:04:23.870> going<00:04:23.960> like<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.370> dark

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
we're going like that and so that dark

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.900 
we're going like that and so that dark
force<00:04:26.030> through<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> clavicle<00:04:27.020> can<00:04:27.910> can

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
force through the clavicle can can

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.260 
force through the clavicle can can
dislocate<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:30.520> clavicle<00:04:31.520> anteriorly<00:04:31.970> so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
dislocate the clavicle anteriorly so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.390 
dislocate the clavicle anteriorly so
above<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.870> skin<00:04:33.200> here<00:04:33.470> but<00:04:33.650> you'll<00:04:34.010> see<00:04:34.250> that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
above the skin here but you'll see that

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.170 
above the skin here but you'll see that
the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.330 
the
we'll<00:04:35.750> stick<00:04:36.050> out<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.229> sand<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.889> because<00:04:37.220> of

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
we'll stick out a sand and because of

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.740 
we'll stick out a sand and because of
the<00:04:37.520> clavicular<00:04:38.210> head<00:04:38.570> of<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
the clavicular head of the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.080 
the clavicular head of the
sternocleidomastoid<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:40.130> if<00:04:40.880> it's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
sternocleidomastoid and if it's

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.150 
sternocleidomastoid and if it's
dislocated<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.900> clavicle<00:04:42.680> will<00:04:42.800> actually

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
dislocated the clavicle will actually

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.860 
dislocated the clavicle will actually
poke<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.120> like<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.820> trauma<00:04:47.330> from<00:04:47.660> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
poke up like so and so a trauma from the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.110 
poke up like so and so a trauma from the
front<00:04:48.259> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> body<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:48.949> again<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.490> in<00:04:49.729> in

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
front of the body so again like in in

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.570 
front of the body so again like in in
football<00:04:50.660> or<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.169> ever<00:04:51.560> die<00:04:51.710> trauma<00:04:52.160> or

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
football or you ever die trauma or

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.560 
football or you ever die trauma or
impact<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.570> sternum<00:04:54.080> here<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:56.120> way<00:04:56.330> and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
impact of a sternum here so that way and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.310 
impact of a sternum here so that way and
you'll<00:04:57.440> get<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.880> dislocation<00:04:58.990> posteriorly<00:04:59.990> to

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
you'll get a dislocation posteriorly to

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.499 
you'll get a dislocation posteriorly to
so<00:05:00.650> some<00:05:01.250> important<00:05:01.669> structures<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.449> are

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
so some important structures that are

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.510 
so some important structures that are
actually<00:05:03.350> in<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.620> air<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:03.919> next<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.430> got

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
actually in the air of the next you got

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.390 
actually in the air of the next you got
the<00:05:04.669> track<00:05:04.940> here<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:06.110> esophagus<00:05:06.680> that

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
the track here and the esophagus that

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.999 
the track here and the esophagus that
you've<00:05:07.520> got<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.699> lung<00:05:07.940> here<00:05:08.440> am<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.710> super

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
you've got the lung here am so super

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.469 
you've got the lung here am so super
hassle<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.400> alone<00:05:10.610> we've<00:05:10.940> also<00:05:11.090> got<00:05:11.300> some

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
hassle it alone we've also got some

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.029 
hassle it alone we've also got some
major<00:05:11.660> blood<00:05:11.990> vessels<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.650> brachial

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
major blood vessels and a brachial

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
plexus that run from them from the root

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.210 
plexus that run from them from the root
the<00:05:16.130> root<00:05:17.080> nerve<00:05:18.080> roots<00:05:18.380> of<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.770> cervical

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
the root nerve roots of the cervical

pet arise minor and innovates the arm

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.010 
pet arise minor and innovates the arm
and<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.699> desiccation<00:05:26.389> can<00:05:26.599> can

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
and so that that desiccation can can

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.040 
and so that that desiccation can can
maybe<00:05:27.199> impinge<00:05:27.740> or<00:05:28.539> rupture<00:05:29.539> those<00:05:29.720> those

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
maybe impinge or rupture those those

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.960 
maybe impinge or rupture those those
important<00:05:30.650> things<00:05:30.680> there<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.610> don't<00:05:31.639> want

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
important things there so you don't want

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.040 
important things there so you don't want
to<00:05:32.060> have<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.360> type<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.840> dislocation<00:05:33.669> em<00:05:35.050> so

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
to have that type of dislocation em so

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.790 
to have that type of dislocation em so
that's<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.289> sternoclavicular<00:05:36.800> joint<00:05:36.830> and

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
that's the sternoclavicular joint and

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.290 
that's the sternoclavicular joint and
just<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.889> another<00:05:39.919> thing<00:05:40.460> just<00:05:40.699> worth<00:05:40.880> pointing

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
just a another thing just worth pointing

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.550 
just a another thing just worth pointing
out<00:05:41.449> which<00:05:41.690> was<00:05:41.900> which<00:05:42.139> I<00:05:42.229> found<00:05:42.409> really

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
out which was which I found really

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.240 
out which was which I found really
interesting<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.789> people<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.419> may<00:05:44.720> have

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
interesting that people that may have

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.830 
interesting that people that may have
forward<00:05:46.250> head<00:05:46.430> posture<00:05:46.729> rounded<00:05:47.330> shoulders

forward head posture rounded shoulders

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.839 
forward head posture rounded shoulders
quite<00:05:48.650> common<00:05:49.010> in<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.190> world<00:05:49.340> today<00:05:49.520> with<00:05:49.820> a
