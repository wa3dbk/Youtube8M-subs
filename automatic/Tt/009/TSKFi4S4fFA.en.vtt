okay we're doing autumn leaves in the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.760 
okay we're doing autumn leaves in the
key<00:00:02.700> of<00:00:02.730> B<00:00:03.120> flat<00:00:03.270> so<00:00:04.110> when<00:00:04.319> you're<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.620> key

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
key of B flat so when you're in the key

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.470 
key of B flat so when you're in the key
of<00:00:04.799> B<00:00:05.009> flat<00:00:05.040> you'll<00:00:05.490> see<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> lot<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:05.970> two<00:00:06.210> five

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
of B flat you'll see a lot of two five

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.390 
of B flat you'll see a lot of two five
ones<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.319> key<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.130> see<00:00:08.280> that

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
ones in a key so you can see that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.049 
ones in a key so you can see that
there's<00:00:08.900> C<00:00:09.900> minor<00:00:10.170> 7<00:00:10.440> F<00:00:10.740> 7<00:00:11.280> B<00:00:11.429> flat<00:00:11.610> major<00:00:11.730> 7<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there's C minor 7 F 7 B flat major 7 so

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.549 
there's C minor 7 F 7 B flat major 7 so
it's<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.480> five<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.900> progression<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
it's a two five one progression and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's a two five one progression and
you'll<00:00:13.830> also<00:00:13.980> see<00:00:14.160> two<00:00:14.549> five<00:00:14.820> ones<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
you'll also see two five ones in the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.000 
you'll also see two five ones in the
relative<00:00:15.870> minor<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> relative<00:00:16.710> minor<00:00:16.830> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
relative minor so the relative minor of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.820 
relative minor so the relative minor of
B<00:00:17.160> flat<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.609> G<00:00:18.090> minor<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> sort<00:00:19.770> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
B flat is G minor and there's a sort of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.620 
B flat is G minor and there's a sort of
minor<00:00:20.130> two<00:00:20.460> five<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.760> progression<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that kind of thing now for this bar

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
that kind of thing now for this bar
because<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.320> G<00:00:46.500> minor<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.670> G<00:00:47.820> minor<00:00:48.030> buzz<00:00:48.210> if

you want to do something a little bit

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.610 
you want to do something a little bit
more<00:00:49.940> interesting<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:50.969> week<00:00:51.180> ago<00:00:51.620> there's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
more interesting than week ago there's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:06.179 
more interesting than week ago there's
an<00:00:52.739> arpeggio

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.859 

and<00:01:07.189> I<00:01:07.280> just<00:01:07.460> contrast<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.180> chords<00:01:08.509> it<00:01:08.600> just

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
and I just contrast the chords it just

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.690 
and I just contrast the chords it just
we<00:01:08.990> play<00:01:11.770> at<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:12.950> point<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.340> can<00:01:13.460> put<00:01:13.580> some

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
we play at this point we can put some

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:26.390 
we play at this point we can put some
rhythm<00:01:13.939> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.380 

I'll<00:01:27.400> just<00:01:27.580> do<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.700> rhythm<00:01:28.000> again<00:01:28.120> for<00:01:28.390> you

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.910 

so<00:01:37.390> that's<00:01:37.480> my<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.810> minor<00:01:38.050> seven<00:01:38.320> flat<00:01:38.350> five<00:01:38.530> I'm

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
so that's my a minor seven flat five I'm

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.430 
so that's my a minor seven flat five I'm
going

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.870 

and<00:01:46.440> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.040> minor<00:01:47.310> seven<00:01:47.640> flat<00:01:47.670> five

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and so that's a minor seven flat five

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:07.360 
and so that's a minor seven flat five
going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.510> d7<00:01:50.360> chromatic<00:01:53.450> dad

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:26.620 

to<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.030> section<00:02:08.360> again<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:26.090> when<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.300> playing

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
to that section again so when I playing

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.869 
to that section again so when I playing
that

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
that

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.990 
that
I<00:02:29.319> hit<00:02:30.319> an<00:02:30.409> octave<00:02:30.769> on<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.920> e-flat<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.640> dime

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.190 

in<00:02:35.000> my<00:02:35.120> tea<00:02:35.180> seven<00:02:35.540> flat<00:02:35.720> nine<00:02:36.280> fifty<00:02:37.280> flat

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
in my tea seven flat nine fifty flat

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.250 
in my tea seven flat nine fifty flat
then<00:02:39.200> into<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> soft-serve<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:44.480> create<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> big

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
then into a soft-serve to create a big

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.020 
then into a soft-serve to create a big
contrast<00:02:45.709> from<00:02:45.799> from<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> lower<00:02:46.549> octave<00:02:46.909> of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
contrast from from the lower octave of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:59.080 
contrast from from the lower octave of
just<00:02:47.209> play

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:20.000 

do<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.330> section<00:03:00.690> big<00:03:00.840> answer

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.200 

and<00:03:21.010> I'm<00:03:21.220> losing<00:03:21.430> my<00:03:21.610> rhythm<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:22.000> just

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
and I'm losing my rhythm here just

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:30.090 
and I'm losing my rhythm here just
finish<00:03:22.450> off<00:03:25.500> ending<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.620> my<00:03:26.770> 6<00:03:27.340> J<00:03:27.670> minus<00:03:27.940> 6
