home<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:01.140> once<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.469> tried<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.179> my<00:02:03.329> own

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
home was once I tried it on to my own

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.419 
home was once I tried it on to my own
lighting<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.289> then<00:02:04.409> went<00:02:04.619> outside<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.250> look

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
lighting and then went outside to look

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.450 
lighting and then went outside to look
at<00:02:05.609> it<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.240> could<00:02:06.420> clearly<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.560> this

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
at it you could clearly see that this

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.400 
at it you could clearly see that this
was<00:02:08.850> kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.420> leaving<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.930> mark<00:02:10.230> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
was kind of leaving a mark of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.510 
was kind of leaving a mark of
demarcation<00:02:10.590> along<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:12.000> neck

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
demarcation along my neck

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.970 
demarcation along my neck
you<00:02:12.880> can<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.570> only<00:02:13.960> used<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.380> little<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.830> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
you can and I only used a little of it

is<00:02:23.410> NW<00:02:24.130> 43<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.930> usually<00:02:26.350> blend<00:02:26.740> this<00:02:26.980> with

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
is NW 43 and I usually blend this with

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.960 
is NW 43 and I usually blend this with
the<00:02:27.850> NW<00:02:28.360> 45<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.230> get<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> perfect<00:02:29.950> look<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.760> what

the NW 45 to get a perfect look so what
I<00:02:31.000> did<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.600> used<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:32.050> little<00:02:32.230> bit<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
I did was I used a little bit of this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
you see today and this look is really

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.550 
you see today and this look is really
good<00:02:38.590> because<00:02:38.770> as<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.310> see<00:02:39.580> my<00:02:40.480> face<00:02:40.900> here

and my neck my chest area here look bad

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.520 
and my neck my chest area here look bad
look<00:02:45.190> very<00:02:45.520> close<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.090> each<00:02:46.150> other<00:02:46.420> when<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> had

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
look very close to each other when I had

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.620 
look very close to each other when I had
this<00:02:47.740> on<00:02:47.950> by<00:02:48.250> itself<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.910> could<00:02:49.120> clearly<00:02:49.510> see

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
this on by itself you could clearly see

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.230 
this on by itself you could clearly see
that<00:02:50.230> my<00:02:50.380> face<00:02:50.560> was<00:02:50.770> darker<00:02:51.280> than<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.880> rest<00:02:52.090> of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
that my face was darker than the rest of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.060 
that my face was darker than the rest of
my<00:02:52.390> body<00:02:52.570> now<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> don't<00:02:52.990> put<00:02:53.320> foundation<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.920> my

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
my body now I don't put foundation on my

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.460 
my body now I don't put foundation on my
neck<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.880> what<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.930> kind<00:02:56.320> of

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
neck but what I like to do is kind of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.700 
neck but what I like to do is kind of
give<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.400> area<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.240> area<00:02:58.510> balance<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
give this area in this area balance and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.880 
give this area in this area balance and
that's<00:03:00.100> what<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.460> do<00:03:00.940> when<00:03:01.210> I<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.530> blend

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's what I do when I you know blend

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.980 
that's what I do when I you know blend
foundations<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.150> blended<00:03:04.630> these<00:03:04.780> two

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
foundations so I blended these two

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.440 
foundations so I blended these two
together<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.440> again<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.130> NW<00:03:06.610> 43<00:03:07.210> and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
together so again this is the NW 43 and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.320 
together so again this is the NW 43 and
this<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.140> 8.0<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.460> mac<00:03:10.770> matchmaster

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
this is the 8.0 in the mac matchmaster

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.170 
this is the 8.0 in the mac matchmaster
not<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:13.540> much<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> match<00:03:14.310> master<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.520> myself

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
not so much a match master for myself

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.080 
not so much a match master for myself
so<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:17.140> some<00:03:17.560> cases<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:18.100> may<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.670> blend

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
so in some cases you may have to blend

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.580 
so in some cases you may have to blend
that's<00:03:19.540> why<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.750> always<00:03:19.930> try<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.170> teach<00:03:20.440> you

out great you have to be careful with
textures<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.680> don't<00:03:39.040> want<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.310> blend

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
textures I don't want you to blend

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.160 
textures I don't want you to blend
something<00:03:39.700> very<00:03:39.970> liquidy<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.630> something

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
something very liquidy and something

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.449 
something very liquidy and something
very<00:03:41.350> thick<00:03:41.590> together<00:03:41.890> that's<00:03:42.160> not<00:03:42.250> gonna

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
very thick together that's not gonna

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.820 
very thick together that's not gonna
work<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.300> if<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.480> blend<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.260> example<00:03:44.650> these

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
work but if you blend for example these

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.820 
work but if you blend for example these
two<00:03:45.010> products<00:03:45.459> by<00:03:46.000> Mac<00:03:46.480> they<00:03:47.050> definitely<00:03:47.470> have

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
two products by Mac they definitely have

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.860 
two products by Mac they definitely have
the<00:03:47.950> same<00:03:48.160> consistency<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.120> same<00:03:49.450> thickness

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
the same consistency the same thickness

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.740
