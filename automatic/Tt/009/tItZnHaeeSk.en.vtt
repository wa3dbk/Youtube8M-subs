ingredient she had written in her

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
ingredient she had written in her
healthy<00:00:25.199> substitution<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.269> example

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

wanted to share with you today are some
healthy<00:00:42.600> substitutions<00:00:43.170> instead<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.040> white

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
healthy substitutions instead of white

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
healthy substitutions instead of white
sugar<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> brown<00:00:44.910> sugar<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.320> are

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
sugar and brown sugar when you are

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.069 
sugar and brown sugar when you are
baking<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.190> brown<00:00:47.730> sugar<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.539> white<00:00:48.750> sugar

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
baking a brown sugar is just white sugar

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
baking a brown sugar is just white sugar
in<00:00:49.200> disguise<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.760> been

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
in disguise so it's actually been

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
in disguise so it's actually been
stripped<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.660> its<00:00:51.719> minerals<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> its

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
stripped of all its minerals all of its
nutrition<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.579> add<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> molasses

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
nutrition then they add the molasses

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
nutrition then they add the molasses
back<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.320> brown<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.579> be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
back in to make it brown so don't be

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
recipe these are substitutions she uses

so<00:01:32.640> coconut<00:01:33.150> sugar<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
so coconut sugar you can get this at the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
so coconut sugar you can get this at the
health<00:01:35.009> food<00:01:35.220> store<00:01:35.450> coconut<00:01:36.450> sugar<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
health food store coconut sugar has a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.130 
health food store coconut sugar has a

glycemic index of only 35 whereas white

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.100 
glycemic index of only 35 whereas white
sugar<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.710> 100<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.150> means<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
sugar is 100 and what that means is the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.760 
sugar is 100 and what that means is the
rate<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.590> which<00:01:43.670> your<00:01:44.670> blood<00:01:44.970> sugar<00:01:45.770> elevates

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
rate at which your blood sugar elevates

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
rate at which your blood sugar elevates
so<00:01:47.360> glucose<00:01:48.360> being<00:01:48.720> 100<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.130> being<00:01:50.399> 35

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so glucose being 100 and this being 35

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.109 
so glucose being 100 and this being 35
so<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.479> has<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.990> lower<00:01:52.409> effect<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
so this has a much lower effect on

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.179 
so this has a much lower effect on
increasing<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.840> blood<00:01:55.020> sugar<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.680> amino

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
increasing your blood sugar it has amino

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.870 
increasing your blood sugar it has amino
acids<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.840> has<00:01:58.140> B<00:01:58.500> complex<00:01:58.950> vitamins<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
acids and it has B complex vitamins it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.899 
acids and it has B complex vitamins it
has<00:02:00.090> minerals<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:02.250> importantly<00:02:02.670> for

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
has minerals but more importantly for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.000 
has minerals but more importantly for
all<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.149> foodies

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
all you foodies

all you foodies
they're<00:02:04.240> coconut<00:02:05.240> sugar<00:02:05.390> adds<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.840> really<00:02:06.020> nice

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
they're coconut sugar adds a really nice

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.200 
they're coconut sugar adds a really nice
sweet<00:02:06.680> taste<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:07.070> baking<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:07.760> great<00:02:07.970> for

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
sweet taste to baking it's great for

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.480 
sweet taste to baking it's great for
muffins<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:09.619> things<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:09.920> banana<00:02:10.369> bread

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490

this<00:02:13.220> another<00:02:14.120> sugar<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:15.110> quite

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this another sugar that I use quite

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.590 
this another sugar that I use quite
often<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:16.190> baking<00:02:16.520> with<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> same<00:02:17.120> types<00:02:17.450> of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
often for baking with the same types of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.710 
often for baking with the same types of
things<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.310> cyka<00:02:19.310> nut<00:02:19.430> sugar<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.970> cyka

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
things is that cyka nut sugar as cyka

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.960 
things is that cyka nut sugar as cyka
nut<00:02:20.870> sugar<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.770> look<00:02:22.040> similar<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.550> brown

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
nut sugar is it look similar to brown

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.990 
nut sugar is it look similar to brown
sugar<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.890> thing<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.640> brown

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
sugar but the thing is it's brown

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.120 
sugar but the thing is it's brown
because<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.930> molasses<00:02:27.440> has<00:02:27.650> not<00:02:27.920> been

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
because the molasses has not been

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.030 
because the molasses has not been
stripped<00:02:28.520> out<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.330> still<00:02:29.900> has<00:02:30.200> minerals

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
stripped out of it it still has minerals

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.030 
stripped out of it it still has minerals
in<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.670> has<00:02:32.060> some<00:02:32.090> vitamins<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.800> has

in it it has some vitamins and that has

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.250 
in it it has some vitamins and that has
a<00:02:34.070> much<00:02:34.340> lower<00:02:34.670> glycemic<00:02:35.060> index<00:02:35.810> than<00:02:35.960> just

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
a much lower glycemic index than just

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.660 
a much lower glycemic index than just
like<00:02:36.470> plain<00:02:36.830> white<00:02:37.220> sugar

caution<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.890> when<00:03:13.130> you're<00:03:13.250> using

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
caution you on is that when you're using

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.910 
caution you on is that when you're using
stevia<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:15.170> really<00:03:15.410> really<00:03:15.620> sweet

so<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.459> need<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.790> make<00:03:16.910> sure<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.450> make

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
so you need to make sure that you make

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.810 
so you need to make sure that you make
the<00:03:17.720> proper<00:03:17.959> substitution<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.040> also<00:03:19.700> if

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
the proper substitution and also if

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.180 
the proper substitution and also if
you're<00:03:20.000> using<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.540> liquid<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.530> recipe<00:03:21.890> that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
you're using the liquid in a recipe that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.850 
you're using the liquid in a recipe that
calls<00:03:22.370> for<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.700> cup<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.269> cocoa<00:03:23.959> sugar<00:03:23.989> that's

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
calls for a cup of cocoa sugar that's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.310 
calls for a cup of cocoa sugar that's
obviously<00:03:25.400> going<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.850> change<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
obviously going to change the the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.250 
obviously going to change the the
texture<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.250> what<00:03:28.850> you're<00:03:29.060> baking<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.110> be

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
texture of what you're baking so just be

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.930 
texture of what you're baking so just be
careful<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.769> just<00:03:31.130> be<00:03:31.250> forewarned<00:03:31.670> I

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940

glucose<00:04:43.560> into<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> bloodstream<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.850> have

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
glucose into the bloodstream so you have

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.659 
glucose into the bloodstream so you have
long-lasting<00:04:45.240> sustainable<00:04:45.900> energy<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.070> then

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669
