driven<00:01:19.430> company<00:01:19.970> it's<00:01:20.210> like<00:01:20.390> working<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:20.750> a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
driven company it's like working with a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.450

group<00:01:21.020> of<00:01:21.110> friends<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.100> comes<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
group of friends and then that comes and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
goes a very long way and I think also

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.290 
goes a very long way and I think also
going<00:01:24.350> back<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.830> how<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.760> company<00:01:26.180> was

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
going back to how the company was

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.940 
going back to how the company was
started<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.840> extracting<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.440> putting

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
started out and extracting it putting

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.320 
started out and extracting it putting
another<00:01:28.190> company<00:01:28.580> or<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.729> business<00:01:28.760> being

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
another company or the business being

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.780 
another company or the business being
flat<00:01:29.600> broke<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.320> like<00:01:30.530> it's<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.370> so<00:01:31.549> bad

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
flat broke it's like it's not so bad

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.670 
flat broke it's like it's not so bad
after<00:01:32.510> all<00:01:32.690> it's<00:01:32.960> like<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.170> survived<00:01:33.500> that

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
after all it's like you survived that

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.950 
after all it's like you survived that
too<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.220> that's<00:01:34.460> why<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:35.000> don't<00:01:35.120> let<00:01:35.390> things

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
too and that's why we don't let things

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.780 
too and that's why we don't let things
like<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:36.200> affect<00:01:36.680> us<00:01:36.830> too<00:01:37.040> much<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:37.670> it

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
like that affect us too much when it

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.330 
like that affect us too much when it
just<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.540> we<00:01:39.440> give<00:01:39.650> up<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:39.979> go<00:01:40.190> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
just it's like we give up and go and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.430 
just it's like we give up and go and
look<00:01:40.940> for<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.150> job<00:01:41.180> somewhere<00:01:41.600> else<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:42.260> always

what many people don't know is that
we've<00:01:55.640> actually<00:01:55.909> worked<00:01:56.210> with<00:01:56.390> free-to-play

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
we've actually worked with free-to-play

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.740 
we've actually worked with free-to-play
since<00:01:57.200> 2009<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.520> we've<00:01:58.970> stepped<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.510> pretty

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
since 2009 so we've stepped on pretty

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.940 
since 2009 so we've stepped on pretty
much<00:01:59.840> every

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
much every

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.679 
much every
mine<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.520> minefield<00:02:02.180> during<00:02:02.539> those

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
mine and that minefield during those

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.840 
mine and that minefield during those
years<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.439> found<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.920> model<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.759> we

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
years but now we found the model that we

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.569 
years but now we found the model that we
really<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.259> as<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.770> studio

something like renegade ops yeah I mean
that's<00:02:50.989> why<00:02:51.560> most<00:02:52.299> developers<00:02:53.299> are<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.380> this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that's why most developers are in this

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.550 
that's why most developers are in this
business<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.340> create<00:02:55.549> your<00:02:55.819> own<00:02:56.019> ideas<00:02:57.019> for

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
lot of ideas and then it takes time to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.259 
lot of ideas and then it takes time to
get<00:03:02.780> those<00:03:02.959> ideas<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.920> become<00:03:04.489> reality<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
get those ideas to become reality and

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.289 
get those ideas to become reality and
sometimes<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:07.010> ideas<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.430> might<00:03:07.579> have<00:03:07.819> when

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
sometimes the ideas you might have when

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.509 
sometimes the ideas you might have when
we<00:03:08.480> pitch<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.049> game<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.350> publisher<00:03:09.829> we<00:03:10.370> can

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
we pitch the game to a publisher we can

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.120 
we pitch the game to a publisher we can
come<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.510> want<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.680> type<00:03:12.889> of<00:03:12.920> game

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
come up we want to do this type of game

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.620 
come up we want to do this type of game
and<00:03:13.370> they<00:03:13.549> say<00:03:13.670> well<00:03:13.819> we<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.209> license

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
and they say well we have this license

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.440 
and they say well we have this license
that<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:15.139> might<00:03:16.130> want<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.459> apply<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.269> idea

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
that you might want to apply that idea

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.900 
that you might want to apply that idea
on<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.079> usually<00:03:18.260> how<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.590> ends<00:03:19.340> up<00:03:19.639> but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
on and that's usually how it ends up but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.729 
on and that's usually how it ends up but
I<00:03:20.030> think<00:03:20.180> every<00:03:20.600> developer<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.230> world<00:03:21.380> is

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
I think every developer in the world is

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.729 
I think every developer in the world is
being<00:03:22.370> driven<00:03:22.639> by<00:03:23.019> creating<00:03:24.019> your<00:03:24.139> own<00:03:24.290> ideas

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
being driven by creating your own ideas

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.160 
being driven by creating your own ideas
that's<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.549> fun<00:03:25.790> part<00:03:25.819> of<00:03:26.269> game<00:03:26.750> development

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170
