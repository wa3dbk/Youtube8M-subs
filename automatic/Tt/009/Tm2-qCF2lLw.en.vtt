00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.740 
they show looks a little more round but
yeah<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:21.000> longer<00:00:21.180> i<00:00:21.330> think<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.630> about

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
yeah a little longer i think it's about

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.080 
yeah a little longer i think it's about
10<00:00:22.230> inches<00:00:22.340> from<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.550> side<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> side

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
10 inches from this side to this side

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970 
10 inches from this side to this side
and<00:00:24.630> about<00:00:24.840> 8<00:00:25.080> inches<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.769> side<00:00:25.949> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and about 8 inches from this side to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.450 
and about 8 inches from this side to
this<00:00:26.099> side<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.880> still<00:00:27.660> actually<00:00:28.109> much<00:00:29.070> much

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
this side so still actually much much

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
this side so still actually much much

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
either do it on auto and you can set the
rate<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> music<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
rate or you can do it to music and then

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
rate or you can do it to music and then
you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> set<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> sensitivity<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> i'm<00:01:38.009> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you can set the sensitivity so i'm just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.789 
you can set the sensitivity so i'm just
going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> DMX<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> red<00:01:43.590> blue

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
going to kind of the DMX is the red blue

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
going to kind of the DMX is the red blue
green<00:01:43.829> chase<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.600> air<00:01:45.750> and

green chase and just put in air and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
green chase and just put in air and
we'll<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> chase<00:01:46.439> by<00:01:46.649> itself<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.100> red<00:01:47.460> blue

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
we'll just chase by itself just red blue

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.249 
we'll just chase by itself just red blue

what<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.470> call<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.770> automatic<00:01:53.250> color<00:01:53.399> fade

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
what they call an automatic color fade

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.289 
what they call an automatic color fade
this<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> slowly<00:01:55.560> dissolves<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
this is where it slowly dissolves this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.340 
this is where it slowly dissolves this
is<00:01:57.420> from<00:01:57.659> one

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
is from one

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
is from one
just<00:01:58.830> slowly<00:01:59.460> dissolved<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.180> another<00:02:00.479> one

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
just slowly dissolved into another one

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.789 
just slowly dissolved into another one
see<00:02:01.470> there<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.400> green<00:02:03.799> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
see there it's kind of go from green is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.979 
see there it's kind of go from green is
either<00:02:04.979> darker<00:02:05.520> blue<00:02:05.759> sort<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.330> come<00:02:06.900> up

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.900 

purple<00:02:09.989> red<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> an<00:02:11.310> orange<00:02:11.459> into

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
purple red now I kind of an orange into

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.390 
purple red now I kind of an orange into
yellow<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:13.069> went<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.190> stood<00:02:14.550> these<00:02:14.730> babies<00:02:15.120> up

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.550 

I<00:02:22.400> was<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.250 

just<00:02:28.560> then

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.710 

No

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
No

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.430 
No
again<00:02:36.410> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:53.979 

we<00:02:40.590> come<00:02:41.340> outside

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:03.850 

here's<00:02:54.989> our<00:02:55.200> orange<00:02:55.530> light<00:02:56.959> was<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.080> par<00:02:58.260> 64

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.240 

i'd<00:03:04.860> say<00:03:05.190> probably<00:03:06.680> know<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> colors<00:03:08.100> are

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
i'd say probably know the colors are

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.479 
i'd say probably know the colors are
fairly<00:03:08.520> matched<00:03:09.890> par<00:03:10.890> 64<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.760> probably<00:03:13.489> I'd

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
fairly matched par 64 is probably I'd

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.070 
fairly matched par 64 is probably I'd
say<00:03:15.800> that's<00:03:16.800> sixty<00:03:17.310> percent<00:03:17.459> brighter<00:03:18.080> so

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
say that's sixty percent brighter so

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.040 
say that's sixty percent brighter so
still<00:03:19.470> pretty<00:03:19.830> good<00:03:20.069> but<00:03:20.580> not<00:03:21.569> quite<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
still pretty good but not quite a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.880 
still pretty good but not quite a
500-watt<00:03:22.769> par<00:03:23.069> 64<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.319> guess<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.799> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
500-watt par 64 so I guess you want to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.729 
500-watt par 64 so I guess you want to
approach<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.610> probably<00:03:26.850> got<00:03:27.060> by<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
approach that you probably got by the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:40.710 
approach that you probably got by the
Colorado<00:03:28.739> one<00:03:28.980> there

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:04:18.190 

Oh

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.260 

you
