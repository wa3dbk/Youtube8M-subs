00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.500
 refused I stop our portal 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.549
 mastery idea protasov because 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.749
 this car needs good 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:08.690
 indicator of the past painted something like 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.030
 so now it's better to trust 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.269
 professionals need first 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.969
 prepare the skin with painting and therefore 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.929
 children defat the surface wrote 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.350
 plan as is known third as 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.850
 other work but I think it is still necessary 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.089
 to help 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.449
 idea is engaged in car painting 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.339
 for many years he is a true connoisseur 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.599
 my business now at my request to him 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.329
 will have the best condition of the wings and 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.310
 hood 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.370
 not to waste a lot of time we are ready 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.160
 extinguish the loss 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.700
 the problem however is that we need 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.350
 avoid two things getting red 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.760
 engine and dirt sticking out 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.140
 Nazarova under the hood painted 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.879
 surface 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.600
 so we laid all Canadian 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.299
 special label protective film 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:47.940
 which is an indispensable thing when 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 first car painting 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.579
 can judge the name of the film 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.260
 make these transitions smoother 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.469
 paint on the edges of the hood and body 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.980
 second 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770
 It will certainly fulfill its protective functions. 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 for example prevents 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.860
 hitting the red sailor to protect 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.700
 last year at least six communications and 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.770
 dust 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.360
 akin to most rare 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.870
 cars for my life and the odds 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.100
 repainting repeatedly 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.710
 initially factory it was all strong 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.330
 to paint the car this time 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.100
 Ideally, we paid great attention to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.530
 various elements of the body 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 outstanding debt requires special 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 appeals 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.229
 applications for what left already started painting 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.890
 but so far only in certain places 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.610
 scratched body parts palette 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.930
 it needs to be good 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.909
 ground dock text what is bad 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.210
 lies on metal goals 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 and this is not the only measure to achieve 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850
 required result each 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.409
 paint coat which we apply here on 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.670
 front of the car can 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.720
 to interact with 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.649
 subsequent 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.509
 so the day is finished spent priming 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.310
 protecting giving possibly chemical 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.169
 surface reactions should be 

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:51.000
 absolutely flat and smooth 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 the first layer we call insulating 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480
 this holy of holies is like cues 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.040
 February and on the left of the week when she 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.780
 will lie on the surface of the body is more important than that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.870
 but in no way change the color red 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.270
 however this liquid is poisonous so i 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 put on a mask 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 plan 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.889
 by the way the insulating layer is most 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.099
 started applying the first layer she 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.180
 the law will eliminate these horrible red-blue 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.069
 the spots and the car body are parked while doing so 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.079
 gray day will cause 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.870
 several layers and i just stand in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 aside and looked 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.780
 in order for this layer to be highly required 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.290
 about ten minutes required 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.290
 continued 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.729
 Diku need to put some more 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.719
 layers as soon as he finished but left 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.749
 good night car 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.749
 then proceed to the top layer 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.719
 so now on the protective layer 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.489
 looks perfectly aligned 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.809
 body surface has become absolutely 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.529
 smooth we are ready for the following 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.149
 layer of course not without dirt we 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.529
 removed the protection film absorbed from PL 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.779
 they are composed now with a plan 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.229
 activities eliminate the remaining 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.869
 traces of contamination on this protective layer 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:28.620
 then the film is glued to the base 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.459
 then again body programs only after 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.319
 this our car will be ready for its 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.629
 new dark red clothes 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.309
 she was only good front 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.599
 car first prepare the track 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.489
 for the doors for this he must pick up 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.959
 her according to this part of red 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.199
 Alfa Romeo body 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.959
 each car and its amendments 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.839
 which usually come out on the tablet people 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.569
 also Vladimir Sokalsky back 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.259
 body parts to prevent the slightest 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.259
 mistakes 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.790
 don't even try to do this 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.340
 procedure yourself at home is that the paint 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.930
 extremely extremely large 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.900
 the whole process is carried out in 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.870
 special room where 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.379
 dust is excluded 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.709
 all measures are also taken here 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.549
 precautions to prevent 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.029
 paint leakage environment 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.230
 why we put on special masks 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.230
 protective suit 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.579
 the place where you just finished applying 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.499
 the first layer has just begun Latvian 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.610
 snack before a full-time dinner 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.409
 it will take three or even four layers when 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.639
 car rental will attract 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.299
 seducers noticed dark 

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:32.819
 Red color 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.919
 There are two main types of paint 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.589
 used when painting cars 

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:38.539
 two-component gold paint 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.509
 paint wildly using that company because 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.039
 that she should hold on longer 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.919
 body surface and sufficient gloss 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.629
 as told cost me 835 feet and i 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.419
 more than satisfied it is significant that already 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.620
 finished yes our last layers 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.650
 of course thank you so much I don't 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.970
 doubted your skill yet 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.940
 only our message sent for the night 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.340
 and cut off my brother's car 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.690
 my grandfather's workshop is seeing me at home 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.690
 get a great pitching 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.529
 finally make the parts 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.050
 Online
