00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
greater the gift as we unify the pain

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.240 
greater the gift as we unify the pain
that<00:03:03.410> we<00:03:03.590> felt<00:03:03.950> being<00:03:04.430> separate<00:03:05.000> from<00:03:05.060> self

that we felt being separate from self

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.280 
that we felt being separate from self
now<00:03:07.250> we<00:03:07.310> connect<00:03:07.940> once<00:03:08.270> more<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:08.989> light

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
now we connect once more to the light

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.989 
now we connect once more to the light
