00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.550 
thing really so they were pretty light
and<00:01:36.179> natural<00:01:36.359> so<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.929> filling<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.319> few

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and natural so I'm just filling in a few

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
and natural so I'm just filling in a few
little<00:01:37.679> gaps<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.219> have<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.789> really<00:01:39.030> trying

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little gaps I have and not really trying

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.459 
little gaps I have and not really trying
to<00:01:39.299> shape<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.719> or<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.109> look<00:01:40.170> really

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
to shape them or make them look really

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.980 
to shape them or make them look really
thick<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.759> applying<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:42.090> primer<00:01:42.719> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
thick I'm just applying some primer and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
thick I'm just applying some primer and
then<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.319> eye<00:01:43.499> look<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.069> pretty

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then the eye look is really pretty

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
then the eye look is really pretty
simple<00:01:44.609> but<00:01:45.090> from<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> picture<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.869> tried<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
simple but from the picture I tried to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
simple but from the picture I tried to
do<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.859> closest<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> could<00:01:47.459> do<00:01:47.729> because

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
do the closest thing I could do because

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.730 
do the closest thing I could do because
she<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.389> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.749> mono<00:01:48.990> brat<00:01:49.409> mono

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
she does kind of have a mono brat mono

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.669 
she does kind of have a mono brat mono
lid<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.759> held<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> monorail

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
lid and held a monorail

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.719 
lid and held a monorail
but<00:01:52.679> she<00:01:52.889> just<00:01:53.009> kind<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.399> model<00:01:53.609> wood

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
but she just kind of have in model wood

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.770 
but she just kind of have in model wood
so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> can't<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.389> what's<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.569> on

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so you can't really see what's going on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
so you can't really see what's going on
on<00:01:54.990> her<00:01:55.170> lid<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.499> her<00:01:55.590> eyes<00:01:55.740> are<00:01:55.920> open<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.340> just

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
on her lid when her eyes are open I just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.809 
on her lid when her eyes are open I just
took<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.999> taupe<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:59.249> of<00:01:59.279> crease<00:01:59.609> and

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
took a taupe on the kind of crease and

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.370 
took a taupe on the kind of crease and

lower<00:02:01.499> lash<00:02:01.740> line<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:01.979> blend<00:02:02.429> it<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.700> really

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
lower lash line and blend it out really

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.029 
lower lash line and blend it out really
soft<00:02:03.359> really<00:02:03.630> light<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.529> kind<00:02:04.679> of<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.920> she

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
the description box but I'm just lining
the<00:02:15.240> upper<00:02:15.270> lash<00:02:15.540> line<00:02:15.810> with<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.349> color<00:02:16.590> it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the upper lash line with that color it's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.290 
the upper lash line with that color it's
kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.190> brownish<00:02:17.550> shimmery<00:02:18.060> color

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
