with with the sword combat people you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.339 
with with the sword combat people you
have<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.450> full<00:03:20.659> control<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.319> can

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
have the full control and you can

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.000 
have the full control and you can
customize<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.760> combustion<00:03:23.540> style<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.739> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
customize the combustion style and the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.600 
customize the combustion style and the
charts<00:03:25.400> exactly<00:03:26.269> as<00:03:26.389> you<00:03:26.569> as

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
charts exactly as you as

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.210 
charts exactly as you as
so<00:03:28.420> obviously<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.260> controls<00:03:29.710> are<00:03:29.920> very

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
so obviously the controls are very

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.330 
so obviously the controls are very
different<00:03:30.670> on<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.780> constant<00:03:32.140> adaptation

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
different on the constant adaptation

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.070 
different on the constant adaptation
they<00:03:33.340> are<00:03:33.400> actually<00:03:33.550> better<00:03:34.390> than<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.960> the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
they are actually better than in the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.960 
they are actually better than in the
original<00:03:35.350> version<00:03:35.830> there<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.670> huge

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
original version there is a huge

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.900 
original version there is a huge
difference<00:03:37.410> between<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.560> pc<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
difference between the pc and the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.110 
difference between the pc and the
consoles<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:40.870> pc<00:03:41.620> player<00:03:42.000> respects<00:03:43.000> and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
consoles and pc player respects and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.230 
consoles and pc player respects and
would<00:03:43.420> console<00:03:43.930> player<00:03:44.170> aspects<00:03:44.770> we<00:03:45.240> created

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
would console player aspects we created

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.310 
would console player aspects we created
a<00:03:46.450> completely<00:03:46.950> new<00:03:47.950> combat<00:03:48.580> system<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.840> is

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
a completely new combat system that is

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.580 
a completely new combat system that is
more<00:03:50.560> dynamic<00:03:50.800> and

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
more dynamic and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.610 
more dynamic and
more<00:03:51.680> engaging<00:03:52.099> but<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:53.690> main<00:03:53.810> difference<00:03:53.870> is

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
more engaging but the main difference is

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.160 
more engaging but the main difference is
that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.490 

console<00:03:57.590> version<00:03:58.010> life<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.490> full<00:03:58.819> control
