00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
winter time they did miss my actual bulb
there<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.579> at<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> tip<00:01:59.969> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
there you can see it just at the tip of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420 
there you can see it just at the tip of
my<00:02:00.119> finger<00:02:00.479> starting<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> come<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.310> don't<00:02:02.310> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
my finger starting to come up don't know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.399 
my finger starting to come up don't know
if<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.790> zoom<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.390> closer<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.049> show<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
if I can zoom in much closer to show you

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.249 
if I can zoom in much closer to show you
there<00:02:05.840> there<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
there there we go so that is the the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
there there we go so that is the the
original<00:02:10.679> plant<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.670> must<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.090> just

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
original plant so this must have just

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.880 
original plant so this must have just
been<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> side<00:02:12.750> growth<00:02:13.020> off<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.410> bulb

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
been a side growth off the bulb

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
been a side growth off the bulb
there<00:02:14.010> gives<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.880> good<00:02:14.970> look<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.300> time<00:02:15.480> what

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
there gives you a good look at time what

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.090 
there gives you a good look at time what
they<00:02:15.780> look<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.950> was

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
they look like and you can see it was

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.180 
they look like and you can see it was
kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.460> freshly<00:02:17.819> um<00:02:18.150> torn<00:02:18.810> off<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.069> thought

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
kind of freshly um torn off so I thought

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770 
kind of freshly um torn off so I thought
that<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.150> I'm<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.360> oh<00:02:21.510> well

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that this was it and I'm like oh well

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.710 
that this was it and I'm like oh well
then<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:22.860> much<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> pot<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:24.450> little

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
then not much in the pot that little

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.780 
then not much in the pot that little
thing<00:02:24.900> makes<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.290> big<00:02:25.440> plant<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> guess

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
thing makes a big plant but I guess

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.610 
thing makes a big plant but I guess
there<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.150> at<00:02:27.300> least<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.720> more<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.350> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
there is at least one more in there so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.640 
there is at least one more in there so
that's<00:02:28.770> good<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> what's<00:02:30.720> better<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.080> guess<00:02:31.380> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that's good so what's better I guess is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.190 
that's good so what's better I guess is
now<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> couple<00:02:32.520> more<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:34.020> made

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
now I have a couple more so I just made

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.910 
now I have a couple more so I just made
a<00:02:34.230> couple<00:02:34.440> indentations<00:02:35.220> here<00:02:35.990> for<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
a couple indentations here for the the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.860 
a couple indentations here for the the
one<00:02:38.190> original<00:02:38.700> bulb<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.150> has<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.600> planted

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
one original bulb that has not planted

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
one original bulb that has not planted
so<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.770> two<00:02:40.950> original<00:02:41.400> bulbs<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.910> then

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so we have two original bulbs and then

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.170 
so we have two original bulbs and then
I'm<00:02:42.660> going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.989> unpack<00:02:43.560> her<00:02:43.860> undo<00:02:44.730> these<00:02:44.940> guys

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
I'm going to unpack her undo these guys

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.640 
I'm going to unpack her undo these guys
and<00:02:45.540> on<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.320> tray<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.920> pop<00:02:47.610> them<00:02:47.850> up<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and on the tray here pop them up and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.840 
and on the tray here pop them up and
then<00:02:49.650> put<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> bit<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.100> top-grossing<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.760> there

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
then put a bit of top-grossing on there

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.699 
then put a bit of top-grossing on there
because<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.060> lost<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.420> good<00:02:51.600> inch<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.230> soil

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
because I lost a good inch or so of soil

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.670 
because I lost a good inch or so of soil
whatever<00:02:52.920> dug<00:02:53.280> through<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.959> let's<00:02:55.500> just

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
whatever dug through it so let's just

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.100 
whatever dug through it so let's just
have<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> look<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.450> did<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.570> up<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.780> bit<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
have a look here I did do up a bit of a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.830 
have a look here I did do up a bit of a
mix<00:02:58.350> just<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.130> go<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.430> top<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.239> pot<00:03:00.450> once

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
mix just to go on top of the pot once

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.610 
mix just to go on top of the pot once
we're<00:03:01.050> ready<00:03:01.320> here<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.540> consists<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and a little bit of perlite for drainage

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
and a little bit of perlite for drainage
so<00:03:19.350> that's<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:19.680> gonna<00:03:19.769> go<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.070> what's<00:03:20.250> gonna

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
so that's just gonna go be what's gonna

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.640 
so that's just gonna go be what's gonna
go<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.610> top<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.360> plants<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.230> let's<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.560> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
go on top of the plants so let's have a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.380 
go on top of the plants so let's have a
look<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.040> see<00:03:23.310> what<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.519> looks<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.850> when<00:03:24.329> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
look and see what that looks like when I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.710 
look and see what that looks like when I
mixed<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:25.730> these<00:03:26.730> guys<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.329> don't<00:03:27.540> want

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
mixed it up these guys you don't want

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.280 
mixed it up these guys you don't want
them<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:27.989> too<00:03:28.829> compact<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.700> soil<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:31.019> want<00:03:31.140> it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
them in too compact of soil you want it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.949 
them in too compact of soil you want it
to<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.530> light<00:03:31.769> airy<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.549> well<00:03:32.880> draining<00:03:33.510> you

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
to be light airy and well draining you

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
to be light airy and well draining you
definitely<00:03:34.470> don't<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.709> them<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.890> sit<00:03:35.130> in

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
definitely don't want them to sit in

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
definitely don't want them to sit in
water<00:03:35.610> especially<00:03:35.970> over<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.570> winter<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
water especially over the winter so the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.870 
water especially over the winter so the
perlite<00:03:37.980> will<00:03:38.100> just<00:03:38.280> add<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.640> drainage

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
perlite will just add to the drainage

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
much bigger than my little one that I

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.100 
much bigger than my little one that I
first<00:04:02.310> showed<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.640> here<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.660> say<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.959> looks

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
first showed you here as I say it looks

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.990 
first showed you here as I say it looks
like<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.350> was<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.560> freshly<00:04:05.040> broken<00:04:05.220> off<00:04:05.549> so

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
like this was just freshly broken off so

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.490 
like this was just freshly broken off so
maybe<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.570> was<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:06.690> like<00:04:06.930> gonna<00:04:07.110> be<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> new

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
maybe it was just like gonna be a new

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.289 
maybe it was just like gonna be a new
growth<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.980> year<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.190> side<00:04:08.459> growth<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:09.209> a

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
growth this year a side growth of a

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.240 
growth this year a side growth of a
broken<00:04:09.630> part<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.930> mine<00:04:10.109> too<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.070> looks

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
broken part on mine too so that looks

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.949 
broken part on mine too so that looks
like<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.430> good<00:04:11.700> bulb<00:04:12.090> though<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.820> here's<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
like a good bulb though and here's the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.080 
like a good bulb though and here's the
other<00:04:16.079> one<00:04:16.289> looks<00:04:16.680> good<00:04:16.890> as<00:04:17.010> well<00:04:17.039> they<00:04:17.940> both

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
other one looks good as well they both

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.610 
other one looks good as well they both
have<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.390> little<00:04:18.630> bit<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.959> new<00:04:19.049> growth<00:04:19.289> on<00:04:19.470> them

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
have a little bit of new growth on them

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.810 
have a little bit of new growth on them
so<00:04:19.769> that's<00:04:19.919> good<00:04:20.280> because<00:04:20.400> then<00:04:20.640> we<00:04:20.789> know

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
so that's good because then we know

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.630 
so that's good because then we know
which<00:04:21.150> way<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.479> up<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.320> D<00:04:22.830> bulb<00:04:23.039> itself<00:04:23.400> and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
which way is up on the D bulb itself and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.969 
which way is up on the D bulb itself and
they<00:04:24.210> were<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.599> some<00:04:24.810> dry<00:04:25.020> peat<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:25.950> I

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
they were just in some dry peat so I

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.910 
they were just in some dry peat so I
guess<00:04:26.160> that's<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.460> good<00:04:26.610> way<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.789> store<00:04:27.270> them

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
guess that's a good way to store them

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.990 
guess that's a good way to store them
but<00:04:28.920> anyways<00:04:29.660> what<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.690> will<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:31.820> now<00:04:32.820> we're
