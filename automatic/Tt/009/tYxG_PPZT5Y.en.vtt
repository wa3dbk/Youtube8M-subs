orange<00:03:59.580> so<00:04:00.210> i<00:04:01.760> didn't<00:04:02.760> use<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:02.880> at<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
orange so i didn't use it at the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.280 
orange so i didn't use it at the
beginning<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.540> video<00:04:03.660> because<00:04:03.930> i<00:04:04.080> forgot

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.260 
using it i thought it looked cool so now
that's<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.310> using<00:04:08.490> for<00:04:08.910> this

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
that's not going to be using for this

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.510 
that's not going to be using for this
game<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.720> I'm<00:04:10.320> just<00:04:10.470> basically<00:04:10.560> using<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.400> as

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
game and I'm just basically using it as

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.840 
game and I'm just basically using it as
a<00:04:12.020> way<00:04:13.020> to<00:04:13.050> remember<00:04:13.860> what<00:04:14.160> happened<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.730> that

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
a way to remember what happened to that

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.180 
a way to remember what happened to that
certain<00:04:15.270> point<00:04:15.480> because<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.650> game<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:16.890> like

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
certain point because this game is like

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.550 
certain point because this game is like
I<00:04:17.340> said<00:04:17.580> warzone<00:04:18.480> takes<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.840> long<00:04:19.080> time<00:04:19.109> this

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
I said warzone takes a long time this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.500 
I said warzone takes a long time this
game<00:04:19.770> is<00:04:19.920> 22<00:04:20.370> minutes<00:04:20.700> we<00:04:20.910> actually<00:04:21.239> do<00:04:21.359> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
game is 22 minutes we actually do the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.400 
game is 22 minutes we actually do the
full<00:04:21.720> seven<00:04:22.020> rounds<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.840> bot<00:04:25.110> thing

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
only actual thing that I think that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.390 
only actual thing that I think that
could<00:05:14.550> be<00:05:15.050> called<00:05:16.050> overpowered<00:05:16.949> in<00:05:17.069> this<00:05:17.219> game

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
could be called overpowered in this game

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.459 
could be called overpowered in this game
as<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.580> lmg<00:05:18.090> because<00:05:18.509> you<00:05:18.689> don't<00:05:18.870> like<00:05:19.080> lose

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
as the lmg because you don't like lose

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.040 
as the lmg because you don't like lose
mobility<00:05:20.249> well<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.270> I'm<00:05:21.569> sure<00:05:21.749> you<00:05:21.870> do<00:05:22.020> but

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
mobility well you I'm sure you do but

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.129 
mobility well you I'm sure you do but
it's<00:05:22.499> not<00:05:22.860> noticeable<00:05:23.069> and<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.870> thing<00:05:25.110> is

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
it's not noticeable and the thing is

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.769 
it's not noticeable and the thing is
just<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:25.770> strong<00:05:26.400> if<00:05:26.969> you<00:05:27.090> just<00:05:27.270> hit<00:05:27.389> fire<00:05:27.599> it

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
just so strong if you just hit fire it

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.659 
just so strong if you just hit fire it
spray<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:28.319> like<00:05:28.439> an<00:05:28.529> SMG<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.189> it<00:05:29.279> has<00:05:29.400> like

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
spray it like an SMG but it has like

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.089 
spray it like an SMG but it has like
more<00:05:30.000> power<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.870> like<00:05:31.229> an<00:05:31.379> insanely<00:05:31.800> long

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
more power and like an insanely long

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.050 
more power and like an insanely long
clip<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.759> can<00:05:32.879> spray<00:05:33.270> forever<00:05:33.599> oh<00:05:33.810> well

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
clip so you can spray forever oh well

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.890 
clip so you can spray forever oh well
