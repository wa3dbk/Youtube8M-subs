iPad we're in the green screen here with

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
iPad we're in the green screen here with
tracking<00:00:28.410> points<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> background<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
tracking points in the background and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
tracking points in the background and
this<00:00:30.210> allows<00:00:30.510> us<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> track<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.320> put<00:00:31.410> us<00:00:31.560> all

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this allows us to track and put us all

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.940 
this allows us to track and put us all
in<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.980> virtual<00:00:32.399> set<00:00:33.170> okay<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
in a virtual set okay so here we are in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.440 
in a virtual set okay so here we are in
behind-the-scenes<00:00:35.640> part<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.090> how<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.300> all

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
behind-the-scenes part of how this all

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.690 
behind-the-scenes part of how this all
works<00:00:36.750> we've<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> cine<00:00:37.860> Drive<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.370> set

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
works we've got the cine Drive all set

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400 
works we've got the cine Drive all set
up<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.210> our<00:00:39.239> pan<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.660> our<00:00:39.870> tilt<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
up here with our pan and our tilt and I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.770 
up here with our pan and our tilt and I
can<00:00:40.590> control<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> iPad

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.400 

and<00:00:50.780> for<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.470> tilt<00:00:52.570> so<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:53.809> go<00:00:53.989> ahead<00:00:54.110> and

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
and for the tilt so I just go ahead and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.200 
and for the tilt so I just go ahead and
have<00:00:54.680> this<00:00:54.800> all<00:00:55.010> pre-programmed<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.970> ready

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
have this all pre-programmed and ready

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.180 
have this all pre-programmed and ready
to<00:00:56.360> go<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:57.079> all<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.260> need<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.590> do<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.829> just<00:00:58.010> go

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
to go then all I need to do is just go

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.340 
to go then all I need to do is just go
ahead<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.460> push<00:00:58.640> play<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.270> it'll<00:00:59.930> go<00:01:00.110> back

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
ahead and push play and it'll go back

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:16.330 
ahead and push play and it'll go back
return<00:01:00.829> back<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.600> prepare<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.720> shot

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.950 

so<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.850> preparing<00:01:18.270> its<00:01:18.510> movement

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so right now it's preparing its movement

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.540 
so right now it's preparing its movement
and<00:01:19.230> getting<00:01:19.830> reset<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> its<00:01:20.520> home<00:01:20.820> position

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
and getting reset to its home position

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.710 
and getting reset to its home position
so<00:01:23.550> now<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.820> ready<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.300> ahead<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.660> do

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so now we're ready to go ahead and do

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
so now we're ready to go ahead and do
the<00:01:24.840> movement<00:01:25.230> here<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.280> back<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> its

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
the movement here it's all back to its

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.670 
the movement here it's all back to its
home<00:01:26.940> position<00:01:27.120> it's<00:01:27.870> preparing<00:01:28.440> its

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
home position it's preparing its

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.010 
home position it's preparing its
trajectory<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.600> once<00:01:30.840> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
trajectory right now and then once it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
trajectory right now and then once it's
ready<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.440> it'll<00:01:31.830> take<00:01:32.040> off<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
ready to go it'll take off and do the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.040 
ready to go it'll take off and do the
movement<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.150> pre-programmed<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
movement that we pre-programmed that you

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.130 
movement that we pre-programmed that you
saw<00:01:34.260> mean<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> beginning<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.220> video

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.200 

we're<00:01:39.740> doing<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.160> horizontal<00:01:40.460> move<00:01:40.910> in<00:01:41.060> here

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
we're doing the horizontal move in here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.850 
we're doing the horizontal move in here
with<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.480> shuttlepod<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.380> vertical

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
with the shuttlepod the vertical

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.340 
with the shuttlepod the vertical
movement<00:01:43.010> with<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.520> city<00:01:43.790> slider<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.780> then

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
movement with the city slider and then

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.890 
movement with the city slider and then
we<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:45.590> our<00:01:45.710> pan<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.010> our<00:01:46.280> tilt<00:01:46.580> all<00:01:47.360> four

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
we have our pan and our tilt all four

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.320 
we have our pan and our tilt all four
axis<00:01:48.500> going<00:01:48.830> at<00:01:48.980> once<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.730> keep<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> shot

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
axis going at once to keep the shot

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.170 
axis going at once to keep the shot
centered<00:01:50.900> on<00:01:51.050> me<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.940> change<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.060> our

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
centered on me and change in our

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.820 
centered on me and change in our
vertical<00:01:53.210> axis<00:01:54.080> point

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:12.110 

you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.130 

so<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.420> things<00:02:13.659> we<00:02:13.810> needed<00:02:14.019> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so one of the things we needed to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.610 
so one of the things we needed to
accomplish<00:02:14.709> here<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:16.150> counterweight

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
accomplish here is a counterweight

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.140 
accomplish here is a counterweight
because<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.829> weight<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.310> camera<00:02:18.609> here

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because the weight of the camera here

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.630 
because the weight of the camera here
with<00:02:19.719> the<00:02:19.959> pan<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.709> tilt<00:02:20.859> system<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.549> this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
with the pan and tilt system and this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.119 
with the pan and tilt system and this
arm<00:02:22.000> was<00:02:22.629> just<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.019> little<00:02:23.230> bit<00:02:23.409> too<00:02:23.620> much<00:02:23.829> for

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
arm was just a little bit too much for

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.599 
arm was just a little bit too much for
the<00:02:24.810> cine<00:02:25.810> slider<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.829> pull<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.159> up<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.489> we

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
the cine slider to pull it up so we

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.000 
the cine slider to pull it up so we
actually<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.629> aviation<00:02:29.319> cable<00:02:29.680> up<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.829> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
actually this aviation cable up to a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.190 
actually this aviation cable up to a
couple<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.430> holies<00:02:30.879> and<00:02:31.060> back<00:02:31.209> down<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
couple of holies and back down here to a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.270 
couple of holies and back down here to a
counterweight

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
counterweight

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.610 
counterweight
we<00:02:34.940> threw<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> 20-pound<00:02:35.810> lifting<00:02:35.960> way<00:02:36.410> down

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
we threw a 20-pound lifting way down

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.830 
we threw a 20-pound lifting way down
here<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.520> kind<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.790> take<00:02:38.000> 20<00:02:38.330> pounds<00:02:38.720> of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
here just to kind of take 20 pounds of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.970 
here just to kind of take 20 pounds of
weight<00:02:39.080> off<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:40.040> vertical<00:02:40.790> axis<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.980> made

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
weight off of the vertical axis and made

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.310 
weight off of the vertical axis and made
for<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> much<00:02:43.400> smoother<00:02:43.880> movement<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:45.080> we<00:02:45.200> use

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
for a much smoother movement so we use

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.230 
for a much smoother movement so we use
several<00:02:45.560> different<00:02:45.740> tracking<00:02:46.430> points<00:02:46.940> we've

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
several different tracking points we've

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.510 
several different tracking points we've
got<00:02:47.480> some<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.990> layer<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.500> am<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
got some at the layer that I am here and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.340 
got some at the layer that I am here and
then<00:02:49.880> also<00:02:50.000> behind<00:02:50.540> me<00:02:50.660> we've<00:02:50.840> actually<00:02:51.020> got

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
then also behind me we've actually got

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.890 
then also behind me we've actually got
the<00:02:51.500> green<00:02:51.770> tape<00:02:52.070> on<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.820> green<00:02:53.030> screen<00:02:53.210> which

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
the green tape on the green screen which

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.830 
the green tape on the green screen which
just<00:02:54.230> allows<00:02:54.350> us<00:02:54.710> enough<00:02:55.010> contrast<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.510> track

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
just allows us enough contrast to track

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.440 
just allows us enough contrast to track
this<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.410> Maya<00:02:57.820> all<00:02:58.820> right<00:02:58.940> we're<00:02:59.090> here<00:02:59.240> in<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
this in Maya all right we're here in the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
this in Maya all right we're here in the
studio<00:02:59.630> here<00:02:59.870> with<00:03:00.020> Sean<00:03:00.230> our<00:03:00.500> graphic<00:03:00.860> artist

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
studio here with Sean our graphic artist

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.010 
studio here with Sean our graphic artist
Sean's<00:03:01.910> been<00:03:02.150> working<00:03:02.540> on<00:03:02.630> putting<00:03:02.840> this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
Sean's been working on putting this

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.380 
Sean's been working on putting this
whole<00:03:03.200> thing<00:03:03.260> together<00:03:03.560> now<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.760> first<00:03:05.150> we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
whole thing together now so first we

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.870 
whole thing together now so first we
have<00:03:05.660> our<00:03:06.040> shoot<00:03:07.040> which<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.520> actually

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
have our shoot which we actually

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.140 
have our shoot which we actually
recorded<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> keep<00:03:09.020> row<00:03:09.290> 4<00:03:09.950> 2<00:03:10.130> 2<00:03:10.310> HQ<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.060> we

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
recorded on a keep row 4 2 2 HQ so we

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.930 
recorded on a keep row 4 2 2 HQ so we
could<00:03:11.300> get<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.570> cleanest<00:03:12.020> green-screen<00:03:12.440> key

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
could get the cleanest green-screen key

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.850 
could get the cleanest green-screen key
so<00:03:13.940> that's<00:03:14.120> what<00:03:14.330> our<00:03:14.360> shot<00:03:14.660> looks<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.050> we

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
so that's what our shot looks like we

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.610 
so that's what our shot looks like we
bring<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.280> been<00:03:16.580> into<00:03:16.880> PF<00:03:17.150> track<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.870> PF

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
bring that been into PF track and PF

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.949 
bring that been into PF track and PF
track<00:03:18.980> then<00:03:19.280> allows<00:03:19.880> us<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.330> get<00:03:20.510> all<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.870> our

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
track then allows us to get all of our

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.740 
track then allows us to get all of our
different<00:03:21.320> markers<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.060> establish<00:03:23.060> really

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
different markers and establish really

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.240 
different markers and establish really
what's<00:03:23.930> going<00:03:24.140> on<00:03:24.380> here<00:03:24.440> he's<00:03:24.830> got<00:03:24.980> little

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
what's going on here he's got little

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.800 
what's going on here he's got little
masks<00:03:25.760> there<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.060> block<00:03:26.240> out<00:03:26.480> some<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
masks there to block out some of the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.170 
masks there to block out some of the
background<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:28.160> accomplishes<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:28.970> we<00:03:29.030> know

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
background this accomplishes so we know

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.670 
background this accomplishes so we know
what<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.480> set<00:03:29.690> looks<00:03:29.990> like<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.500> wherever

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
what the set looks like and wherever

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.160 
what the set looks like and wherever
your<00:03:30.860> position<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.520> the<00:03:31.640> set<00:03:31.910> then<00:03:32.630> once<00:03:32.900> that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
your position in the set then once that

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.020 
your position in the set then once that
set<00:03:33.500> we<00:03:33.860> actually<00:03:34.160> built<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.550> set<00:03:34.760> over<00:03:35.000> here

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
set we actually built the set over here

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.340 
set we actually built the set over here
in<00:03:35.420> Maya<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:38.350> architecture

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
in Maya and this is the the architecture

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.930 
in Maya and this is the the architecture
that<00:03:39.500> he<00:03:39.620> made<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.070> then<00:03:40.459> we<00:03:40.580> applied

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
that he made and then we applied

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.240 
that he made and then we applied
different<00:03:41.690> materials<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.350> these<00:03:42.500> walls<00:03:42.830> to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
different materials to these walls to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.130 
different materials to these walls to
get<00:03:43.700> kind<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:43.970> our<00:03:44.090> final<00:03:44.480> look<00:03:44.630> here's<00:03:45.050> our

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
get kind of our final look here's our

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.570 
get kind of our final look here's our
initial<00:03:45.350> little<00:03:45.650> sketch<00:03:46.070> that<00:03:46.280> he<00:03:46.400> put

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
initial little sketch that he put

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.160 
initial little sketch that he put
together<00:03:46.730> for<00:03:47.150> our<00:03:47.180> idea<00:03:47.570> of<00:03:47.690> how<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> build

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
together for our idea of how to build

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.280 
together for our idea of how to build
this<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.590> little<00:03:49.130> three<00:03:49.730> wall<00:03:50.090> set<00:03:50.570> with<00:03:51.050> kind

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
this a little three wall set with kind

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.920 
this a little three wall set with kind
of<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.410> curved<00:03:51.680> background<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> step

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
of a curved background here for a step

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.320 
of a curved background here for a step
so<00:03:54.620> then<00:03:54.890> we<00:03:55.130> took<00:03:55.310> those<00:03:55.489> materials<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
so then we took those materials and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.660 
so then we took those materials and
applied<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.930> from<00:03:57.440> a<00:03:57.530> previous<00:03:58.040> steel<00:03:58.370> shoot

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
applied it from a previous steel shoot

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.940 
applied it from a previous steel shoot
that<00:03:58.820> we<00:03:58.970> had<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.510> now<00:04:00.320> this<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.709> what<00:04:00.830> it

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
that we had and now this is what it

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.750 
that we had and now this is what it
looks<00:04:01.160> like<00:04:01.250> we've<00:04:01.580> got<00:04:02.410> our<00:04:03.410> talent<00:04:04.100> in<00:04:04.580> a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
looks like we've got our talent in a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.670 
looks like we've got our talent in a
virtual<00:04:05.150> set<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.900> can<00:04:06.080> go<00:04:06.200> ahead<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.500> roll

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
virtual set you can go ahead and roll

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.930 
virtual set you can go ahead and roll
through<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.459> can<00:04:07.580> just<00:04:07.730> kind<00:04:07.880> of

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
through that and you can just kind of

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.600 
through that and you can just kind of
see<00:04:08.180> how<00:04:08.750> our<00:04:08.900> virtual<00:04:09.290> set<00:04:09.530> looks<00:04:09.799> started

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
see how our virtual set looks started

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.300 
see how our virtual set looks started
out<00:04:10.700> kind<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.000> at<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> wide<00:04:11.450> low<00:04:11.959> shot<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.950> kind
