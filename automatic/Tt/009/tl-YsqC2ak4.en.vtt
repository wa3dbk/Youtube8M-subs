00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
that like to set off load players so I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.350 
that like to set off load players so I
could<00:02:52.320> have<00:02:52.500> fooled<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.730> rid<00:02:53.910> ow<00:02:54.090> in

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
could have fooled to get rid ow in

the<00:05:53.760> Quint<00:05:54.060> who<00:05:54.390> again<00:05:55.140> I<00:05:55.169> haven't<00:05:55.380> even<00:05:55.530> used

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
the Quint who again I haven't even used

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.500 
the Quint who again I haven't even used
these<00:05:55.980> worth<00:05:56.130> of<00:05:56.250> one-million<00:05:56.730> somehow<00:05:57.090> I

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
these worth of one-million somehow I

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.960 
these worth of one-million somehow I
don't<00:05:57.930> think<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.200> that<00:05:58.320> good<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:59.010> obviously

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
don't think is that good and obviously

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.730 
don't think is that good and obviously
have<00:06:00.120> been<00:06:00.150> see<00:06:00.419> already<00:06:00.630> in<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:00.930> team<00:06:01.140> so<00:06:01.440> if

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
have been see already in the team so if

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.990 
have been see already in the team so if
we<00:06:01.830> can<00:06:01.919> get<00:06:02.040> Ben<00:06:02.160> Xia<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.550> four<00:06:02.640> down<00:06:02.730> next<00:06:02.880> to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
we can get Ben Xia and four down next to

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.400 
we can get Ben Xia and four down next to
each<00:06:03.090> other<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.480> think<00:06:03.720> that's<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:03.990> great<00:06:04.200> pair

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
each other I think that's a great pair

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.860 
each other I think that's a great pair
in<00:06:04.620> for<00:06:04.890> Premiership<00:06:05.310> for<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.460> Premiership

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
in for Premiership for the Premiership

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.000 
in for Premiership for the Premiership
you<00:06:06.870> quickly<00:06:07.080> talk<00:06:07.260> about<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.680> object<00:06:07.919> is

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
you quickly talk about the object is

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.940 
you quickly talk about the object is
that<00:06:08.130> I<00:06:08.190> have<00:06:08.400> for<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.790> series<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.830> think<00:06:10.830> this

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
that I have for this series I think this

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.950 
that I have for this series I think this
season<00:06:11.130> is<00:06:11.669> more<00:06:12.180> about<00:06:12.300> just<00:06:12.360> bolstering<00:06:12.780> and

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
season is more about just bolstering and

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.210 
season is more about just bolstering and
just<00:06:13.080> trying<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.320> make<00:06:13.440> sure<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:13.620> stay<00:06:13.919> in<00:06:14.100> the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
just trying to make sure I stay in the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.400 
just trying to make sure I stay in the
Premiership<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:14.730> can<00:06:14.880> push<00:06:15.060> on<00:06:15.240> and<00:06:15.510> the

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
Premiership and I can push on and the

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.900 
Premiership and I can push on and the
objective<00:06:16.800> is<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:16.980> eventually<00:06:17.550> win<00:06:17.850> the

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
objective is to eventually win the

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.190 
objective is to eventually win the
Champions<00:06:18.300> League<00:06:18.390> and<00:06:18.720> once<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.930> win<00:06:18.990> the

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
Champions League and once I win the

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.510 
Champions League and once I win the
Champions<00:06:19.560> League<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.890> will<00:06:19.980> probably<00:06:20.160> end

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
Champions League I will probably end

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.430 
Champions League I will probably end
this<00:06:20.790> series<00:06:21.060> and<00:06:21.840> maybe<00:06:21.990> start<00:06:22.260> a<00:06:22.290> whole<00:06:22.410> new

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
this series and maybe start a whole new

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.409 
this series and maybe start a whole new
career<00:06:22.650> mode<00:06:22.890> I<00:06:23.010> don't<00:06:23.160> know<00:06:23.370> we'll<00:06:24.210> see<00:06:24.240> what

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
career mode I don't know we'll see what

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:25.790 
career mode I don't know we'll see what
the<00:06:24.540> kind<00:06:24.660> of<00:06:24.750> feedback<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.169> get<00:06:25.230> after<00:06:25.710> that

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
the kind of feedback I get after that

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.140 
the kind of feedback I get after that
had<00:06:25.890> she<00:06:26.010> happens<00:06:26.250> if<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.430> ever<00:06:26.550> happens<00:06:26.940> but

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
had she happens if it ever happens but

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.880 
had she happens if it ever happens but
that's<00:06:27.570> the<00:06:27.720> kind<00:06:27.840> of<00:06:27.960> main<00:06:28.260> objective<00:06:28.650> I<00:06:28.740> want

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
that's the kind of main objective I want

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.170 
that's the kind of main objective I want
to<00:06:28.980> get<00:06:29.130> to<00:06:29.280> is<00:06:29.430> full<00:06:29.610> of<00:06:29.790> meal<00:06:30.030> what's

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
to get to is full of meal what's

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.220 
to get to is full of meal what's
eventually<00:06:30.360> win<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.840> Champions<00:06:31.169> League

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
eventually win the Champions League

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.530 
eventually win the Champions League
which<00:06:31.590> is<00:06:31.710> very<00:06:31.890> unrealistic<00:06:32.360> and<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.419> think

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
which is very unrealistic and I think

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.940 
which is very unrealistic and I think
that<00:06:33.660> was<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.810> good<00:06:33.990> a<00:06:34.050> big<00:06:34.260> drawing<00:06:34.440> point<00:06:34.740> of

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
that was a good a big drawing point of

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.380 
that was a good a big drawing point of
my<00:06:35.130> series<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.520> fact<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.970> was<00:06:36.120> realistic

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
my series the fact that it was realistic

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.850 
my series the fact that it was realistic
I<00:06:36.600> think<00:06:36.720> by<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:36.960> time<00:06:37.020> I<00:06:37.200> win<00:06:37.440> the<00:06:37.530> Champions

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
I think by the time I win the Champions

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.560 
I think by the time I win the Champions
League<00:06:37.919> it<00:06:38.580> won't<00:06:38.760> be<00:06:38.880> realistic<00:06:39.240> anymore

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
League it won't be realistic anymore

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.270 
League it won't be realistic anymore

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
because the lots of players to be region

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.930 
because the lots of players to be region
