the thing I hate about baby food so far

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
the thing I hate about baby food so far
is<00:01:54.840> its<00:01:55.049> consistency<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> guess<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> one

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
is its consistency so I guess the one

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
is its consistency so I guess the one
thing<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.149> commend<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.960> its

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
thing you can commend it on is its

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.060 
thing you can commend it on is its
consistency<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> having<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> bad<00:02:00.060> consistency

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
consistency and having a bad consistency

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.050 
consistency and having a bad consistency
