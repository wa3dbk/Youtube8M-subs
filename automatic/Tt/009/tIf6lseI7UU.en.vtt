00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 adrien hello wes saw then we 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.730
 are the day before the championships of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.230
 france we are atone hotel yeah bah there 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 it starts to rise slowly 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 the impression is still going 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 I have just been mass and so 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.939
 here we sit quietly and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.259
 then we'll wait a little bit that the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.050
 meeting of sports directors was 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.320
 get bibs and then 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.250
 the meal then what comments without 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 a few hours before taking the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.629
 departure is what the last 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.690
 sensations on the bike was good at 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.199
 web this morning we spotted circuit that goes 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.719
 to be a course or a course using 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:48.030
 with a lot of difference in altitude, it's going to be a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 relatively open race I think that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.020
 after it will have to see the conditions 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.850
 but it's likely to be 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.859
 a lot by the back and placement 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.170
 okay what you have a leader in 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.460
 the team where everyone can play their card 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.929
 finally here I think we go each his 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.539
 playing card let's see how the 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.149
 race is going to unfold it's going to have to be 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.270
 presented to the advanced is mandatory 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.160
 on a circuit like that if we have to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 start to roll to end I 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.899
 think that as soon as we are out of season 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.700
 on a course like that it's over so 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.729
 prayer the classes tomorrow these are 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.289
 inevitably of course an advantage and we will 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.050
 see how it's going to be like 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:32.160
 place yourself well and then follow the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.989
 good shots and having a nose on 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.619
 banks that are going out that's a 

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:39.300
 course that you like this year x and 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.429
 yeah that can it suits me that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.920
 can suit me the sensations they 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.239
 are they are good since since 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.470
 three weeks a month 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:51.680
 so I hope it'll go we'll see 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.090
 the classics I have not really 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.130
 race 250 km but good normally that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.560
 should drive and then the races of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.530
 circuit it's also it's also some 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.320
 something that pleases me well here 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.840
 we shall come to what place it will 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.400
 fight how will be the race 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.630
 is in any case it is with the teams 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.690
 finally the three teams represented 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.200
 what with nag or not I do not know 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.300
 at all so I'm confident anyway 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.930
 it's okay but you leave yourself 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.360
 to rest 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.190
 go eat quietly who we are going to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.660
 follow you tomorrow 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 thank you wish good luck thank you this is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.690
