hello hello people I'm going to show you
today<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.970> new<00:00:06.210> hack<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.230> have<00:00:07.379> seen<00:00:07.760> some

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
today a new hack if you have seen some

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.580 
today a new hack if you have seen some
other<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.120> videos<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.840> have<00:00:09.870> seen<00:00:10.260> how

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
other of my videos you have seen how

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.580 
other of my videos you have seen how
could<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.070> use<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.490> internal<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> years<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
could I use an internal the years and

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.580 
could I use an internal the years and
this<00:00:13.590> serial<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.790> control<00:00:15.750> stepper<00:00:16.170> motors

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
this serial to control stepper motors

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.679 
this serial to control stepper motors
and<00:00:17.300> today<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.630> I'm<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:20.689> use

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
and today what I'm going to do is to use

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.099 
and today what I'm going to do is to use
the<00:00:22.140> disc<00:00:22.439> serial<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:24.119> data<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.689> other

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the disc serial to get data from other

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
the disc serial to get data from other
devices<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.119> displayed<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.160> Nintendo<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
devices and displayed in the Nintendo so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
devices and displayed in the Nintendo so
in<00:00:30.330> particular<00:00:30.539> today<00:00:31.109> I'm<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
in particular today I'm going to be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
in particular today I'm going to be
using<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:32.570> optical<00:00:33.570> mouse<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:35.360> let's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
using this optical mouse and let's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
using this optical mouse and let's
launch<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.820> six<00:00:39.860> yeah<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.090> two

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
launch it and six yeah so there are two

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
launch it and six yeah so there are two
ways<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.870> an<00:00:43.079> optical<00:00:43.649> mouse<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.160> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
ways to use an optical mouse one is to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.209 
ways to use an optical mouse one is to
to<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> position<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.680> use<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to get the position one is to use the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180 
to get the position one is to use the
serial<00:00:47.579> port<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.260> another<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
serial port and another way is to use a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.930 
serial port and another way is to use a
special<00:00:50.730> special<00:00:51.449> bus<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.789> optical<00:00:53.789> mouse

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
special special bus that optical mouse

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729 
special special bus that optical mouse
is<00:00:54.090> half<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> will<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> using

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
is half and that's what it will be using

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.810 
is half and that's what it will be using
today<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.520> i<00:00:57.079> can<00:00:58.079> i<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
today because i can i can get the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
today because i can i can get the
position<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.859> many

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
position as well but i can get many

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
position as well but i can get many
other<00:01:02.609> things<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> i<00:01:03.270> will<00:01:03.480> show<00:01:03.719> later<00:01:05.390> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
other things that i will show later so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.920 
other things that i will show later so
to<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:08.100> i<00:01:08.390> okay<00:01:11.510> how<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> optical

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
to show how can i okay how the optical

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
to show how can i okay how the optical
mouse<00:01:13.140> works<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.509> move<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
mouse works but i just have to move it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.730 
mouse works but i just have to move it
and<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> i<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.320> track<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and we see that i can track the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.289 
and we see that i can track the
emotional<00:01:20.700> day<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.689> internal<00:01:22.049> years<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
emotional day on an internal years and

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.850 
emotional day on an internal years and
something<00:01:24.299> else<00:01:24.390> i<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.530> very

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
something else i can do which is very

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
something else i can do which is very
cool<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.030> optical<00:01:27.360> mouse<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
cool is that the optical mouse it is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.270 
cool is that the optical mouse it is
indeed<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.850> camera<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.479> i<00:01:30.630> put<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:32.040> now

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
indeed a camera so if i put it and now

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.390 
indeed a camera so if i put it and now
you<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> different<00:01:34.400> program

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you i have to use a different program

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.670 
you i have to use a different program
they<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.060> maybe<00:01:36.329> nintendo<00:01:36.810> DS<00:01:36.930> i<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
they have here maybe nintendo DS i can

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
they have here maybe nintendo DS i can
display<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> optical<00:01:39.030> mouse<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.600> seeing

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
display what the optical mouse is seeing

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
display what the optical mouse is seeing
so<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.350> i<00:01:40.470> put<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.890> top<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.030> piece

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so if i put it on top of this this piece

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
so if i put it on top of this this piece
of<00:01:42.210> paper<00:01:42.450> i'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of paper i'm going to use it because it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
of paper i'm going to use it because it
has<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.460> lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> small<00:01:45.030> text<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:46.380> i

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
has it has a lot of a small text if i

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.389 
has it has a lot of a small text if i
put<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> top<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.930> see

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
put it on the top right I can see

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
put it on the top right I can see
display<00:01:50.399> whatever<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.420> optical<00:01:51.750> mouse<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
display whatever the optical mouse is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.330 
display whatever the optical mouse is
seeing<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.869> by<00:01:54.869> using<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.799> lens<00:01:56.040> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
seeing so if by using the right lens I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
seeing so if by using the right lens I
could<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:59.000> as<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.210> device<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
could use this as a as a device to I for

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.319 
could use this as a as a device to I for
example<00:02:01.740> i<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.100> put<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> nintendo<00:02:02.939> dsi<00:02:03.210> on

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
example i could put the nintendo dsi on

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.660 
example i could put the nintendo dsi on
top<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:03.689> RC<00:02:04.049> car<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.070> could<00:02:05.280> stream

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
top of an RC car and I could stream

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.359 
top of an RC car and I could stream
video<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.570> computer<00:02:06.930> somewhere<00:02:07.350> else<00:02:07.680> okay

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
video to a computer somewhere else okay

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.029 
video to a computer somewhere else okay
it's<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.789> low<00:02:09.119> resolution

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
it's going to be a very low resolution

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.490 
it's going to be a very low resolution
anyways<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.759> quite<00:02:11.090> cool<00:02:14.049> what<00:02:15.049> else<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
anyways it's quite cool what else I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.920 
anyways it's quite cool what else I
could<00:02:15.590> track<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.450> position<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> car

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
could track the position of the car
