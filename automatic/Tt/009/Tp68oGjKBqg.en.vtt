 here we see immediately in the counter 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:36.660
 very simple the package but then 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:40.579
 we have the adapter adapter 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.579
 component that must be inserted 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.390
 that's enough 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:18.920
 then we have the component that will go 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:18.920
 in our monitored playstation 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.360

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.360
 on the adapter we have inserted 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:44.970

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.000
 only the last cable that what 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:38.250

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 computer in our usb socket which 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.370
 then our computer USB socket will go 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.220
 very well instead while 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.160

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.180

 equipment and cables always out of component e 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.650
 audio should be attached directly to the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.579
 television in the various specials makes up his
