00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.140
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 follow the mod showcase for the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.710
 agricultural simulator 15 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.360
 This time we will introduce you one 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 modification before which a function 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.410
 expanding of the game by several aspects 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 in the casino bunker in a slip 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 Fill and then the material easy 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.650
 and quickly consolidate by one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.990
 drives over it a few times 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.070
 what the almost six-year-olds show 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.070
 So we'll keep it to you 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.719
 the modification 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.329
 Promotion is customarily installed 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.070
 archives are placed in the motto ice 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.509
 that is done by the modification 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090
 automatically for every game and is too 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.350
 usable in every savegame 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.359
 the filling of silo points in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.310
 Standard game is very easy man 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.380
 tipping grass or witch well into a bunker 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.969
 rolls over with a vehicle several times 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 the heap until a war of destruction of 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.560
 our percent is displayed 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.959
 and think of the silo fermented now 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.030
 The material is 100% silage and can 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.829
 reused 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.359
 the modification fahrsilo extension 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.119
 now changes some aspects of this 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.069
 on the one hand, it is no longer 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.569
 no matter what you get a silo filled it comes 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.179
 not automatically silage as a product 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.399
 You have to differentiate between you 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.289
 grass chaff or potatoes stuffs 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.860
 To hire either hay 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.969
 produce silage or mixed feed 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.869
 a filled point must also 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.640
 be compacted 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.770
 it is no longer enough anywhere in the world 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.299
 bunker over wanting to have the material 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.060
 distributed and run there separately 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.189
 performed the last aspect concerns 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.989
 the durability of the material is not yet 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.770
 fermented the material is no more 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.090
 lasted forever 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.500
 that means you fill a bunker 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.620
 moussa covered within a few days 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.940
 Be otherwise administrator content 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.410
 Performance now plays a role and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.000
 compacts the material increases the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.849
 chance that part also hope during the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.410
 fermentation process as rot 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.430
 a product is at the nist which 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.430
 must be eliminated 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.330
 silo point 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.730
 hay silage and stop producing 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.230
 Each of these three requires a product 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.820
 a certain mismatch in the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.470
 store with it after the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.930
 change process the desired 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.909
 product is available 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.849
 new arises by the content 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.670
 at least 40% grass is added to the content 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.409
 fermented to hay silage arises 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.989
 by making the bunker feel good with excel 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.730
 it must not exceed 39 degrees 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.230
 or ten percent potatoes mixed 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.829
 will agree the conditions 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.730
 fermented content to silage 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.950
 mixed feed is created by the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.349
 Filling quantity from excel good ten to 40 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.849
 percent potatoes adds that 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.909
 Relationship to the content 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.889
 mixed feed when filling a bunker 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.250
 now some aspects have to be considered 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.799
 become 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.139
 a compacted material now has three 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.659
 times the volume of compressed material 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.099
 This results in high heap rolls 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.099
 over a part of heap stay next to it 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.329
 lying hafner and touches the optimal 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.430
 filling and destroying process 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.650
 bein consider it a spill of material 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.510
 then spreading the material under 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.159
 using shovels or pushing 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.260
 push and then on 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.269
 crushing materials with silo rollers 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.829
 this process repeats itself several times 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.689
 until the bunker film the desired 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.359
 has reached and can be covered 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.680
 in the infobox you always have the 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.930
 Overview of the war of annihilation 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.180
 entire bunkers as well as the individual 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.769
 3 run 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.720
 Seelow shields and roll there 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.940
 special for download we use in 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.290
 this example, a silo device park the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.670
 download link is in the video 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.860
 description 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.870
 the aspect of distributing and condensing 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.760
 It is important because material now too 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.110
 can gather 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.060
 Holtmann is just over big heaps 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.590
 takes the compress longer a da 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.660
 heaps that are not completely done 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.550
 can passed 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.410
 every percentage point difference to 100 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.850
 leads depending on the degree of difficulty 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.620
 a higher chance that this up 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.930
 after Mr. Matthaus process as mist 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.820
 must be grounded and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.520
 processed material in the bunkers 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 is no longer durable 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.610
 you pour in material and leave it 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.130
 several days are rotten and for 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.190
 are initially depending on the difficulty 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.100
 It condensed 63 or two days 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.960
 material holds it twice as long 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.700
 modification enriches the work with 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.500
 Silos immensely and not only increases the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.240
 playful aspect but requires 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.800
 now also some planning what part now 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.800
 agricultural work is 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.129
 more information and links found 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.330
 her in the video description and 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.539
 do not forget about the men 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.539
 thank
