Gardens<00:00:03.770> now<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:04.980> just<00:00:05.009> occurred<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.670> me<00:00:05.879> that

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
Gardens now it just occurred to me that

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.970 
Gardens now it just occurred to me that
I<00:00:06.180> haven't<00:00:06.509> done<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.839> green<00:00:07.140> house<00:00:07.319> video<00:00:07.740> in

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I haven't done a green house video in

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.879 
I haven't done a green house video in
quite<00:00:08.250> some<00:00:08.490> time<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.059> really<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:10.080> do<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> lot

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
quite some time and really we do a lot

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
quite some time and really we do a lot
of<00:00:10.920> upgrades<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.840> particular<00:00:12.960> this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
of upgrades here and in particular this

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.790 
of upgrades here and in particular this
past<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.790> past<00:00:15.030> spring<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.690> made<00:00:16.139> three<00:00:16.560> big

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
past this past spring we made three big

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
past this past spring we made three big
changes<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.090> let's<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.420> over<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.960> those

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
changes so let's go over some of those

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.700 
changes so let's go over some of those
now<00:00:20.119> first<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.390> here's<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> quick<00:00:22.230> look<00:00:22.410> at<00:00:22.529> one

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
now first off here's a quick look at one

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.279 
now first off here's a quick look at one
of<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:22.920> newest<00:00:23.340> systems<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.750> been<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> work

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
of our newest systems it's been a work

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
of our newest systems it's been a work
in<00:00:25.470> progress<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> year<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.789> would

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
in progress for about a year now I would

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.970 
in progress for about a year now I would
say<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.990> suffered<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.710> bit<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
say and it suffered from a bit of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
say and it suffered from a bit of
project<00:00:29.580> creep<00:00:29.910> especially<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.840> comes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
project creep especially when it comes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.860 
project creep especially when it comes
to<00:00:31.170> return<00:00:31.470> pumps<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.759> started<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.510> one

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to return pumps we started with just one

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.660 
to return pumps we started with just one
and<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.469> had<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> add<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> second<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and then had to add a second one for

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.869 
and then had to add a second one for
more<00:00:35.820> flow<00:00:36.469> then<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.620> added<00:00:37.800> sea<00:00:38.160> swirls<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
more flow then we added sea swirls and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.690 
more flow then we added sea swirls and
then<00:00:39.030> gave<00:00:39.239> them<00:00:39.360> their<00:00:39.600> own<00:00:39.719> return<00:00:40.020> pump

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
then gave them their own return pump

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
then gave them their own return pump
finally<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.879> added<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.390> large<00:00:42.600> skimmer<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
finally we added in a large skimmer that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160 
finally we added in a large skimmer that
needed<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> feed<00:00:44.100> pump<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.660> started<00:00:45.960> with

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
needed a feed pump so what started with

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.090 
needed a feed pump so what started with
just<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.710> pump<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.340> required<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:49.100> was

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just one pump now required for I was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
just one pump now required for I was
certainly<00:00:50.550> looking<00:00:50.910> forward<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> change

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
certainly looking forward to this change

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.720 
certainly looking forward to this change
because<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> having<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.430> snake

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
because they don't like having a snake

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
because they don't like having a snake
pit<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.090> wires<00:00:54.360> around<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.960> tanks<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
pit of wires around my tanks there is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
pit of wires around my tanks there is
always<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.989> some<00:00:58.230> degree

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
always going to be one to some degree

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
always going to be one to some degree
but<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.430> opportunity<00:00:59.460> to<00:01:00.239> remove<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but here was an opportunity to remove a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.429 
but here was an opportunity to remove a
bunch<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> pumps<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.559> free<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.129> outlets

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
bunch of pumps and free up outlets

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.170 
bunch of pumps and free up outlets
re-plumbing<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.650> system<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> bit

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
re-plumbing a system like this was a bit

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
re-plumbing a system like this was a bit
of<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.360> ordeal<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> total<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of an ordeal because there's a total of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580 
of an ordeal because there's a total of
11<00:01:08.490> separate<00:01:08.909> tanks<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.750> make<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> unit

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
11 separate tanks that make up the unit

continues to run I've gone on and on

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
continues to run I've gone on and on
about<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:38.939> great<00:01:39.000> reunions<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.229> other

about how great reunions are in other

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
about how great reunions are in other
videos<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> won't<00:01:41.549> belabor<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> point<00:01:42.090> here

videos so I won't belabor the point here

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
videos so I won't belabor the point here
too<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:44.250> say<00:01:44.549> though<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.090> I've

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
too much I will say though that I've

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.160 
too much I will say though that I've
never<00:01:45.450> regretted<00:01:45.960> installing<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.829> true<00:01:47.070> union

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
never regretted installing a true union

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
never regretted installing a true union
here<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> pump<00:01:49.710> finally<00:01:50.280> installed<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
here is the pump finally installed and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
here is the pump finally installed and
tucked<00:01:51.210> under<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> system<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:52.710> thrilled

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
tucked under the system I'm thrilled

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
tucked under the system I'm thrilled
with<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> new<00:01:53.729> pump<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.060> performing<00:01:54.689> not

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
with how the new pump is performing not

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
with how the new pump is performing not
only<00:01:55.740> did<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.950> replace<00:01:56.310> four<00:01:56.610> other<00:01:56.880> pumps<00:01:57.360> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
only did it replace four other pumps but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.810 
only did it replace four other pumps but
it<00:01:57.960> provides<00:01:58.320> noticeably<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.250> flow<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it provides noticeably more flow and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
it provides noticeably more flow and
actually<00:02:00.390> consumes<00:02:00.840> less<00:02:01.170> electricity

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.230 

the<00:02:05.530> second<00:02:06.040> major<00:02:06.310> project<00:02:07.030> at<00:02:07.149> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the second major project at the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.330 
the second major project at the
greenhouse<00:02:07.509> was<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.259> addition<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.770> new<00:02:08.830> shade

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
greenhouse was the addition of new shade

greenhouse was the addition of new shade
cloths<00:02:09.720> I've<00:02:10.720> probably<00:02:11.080> said<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.739> hundred

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
cloths I've probably said it a hundred

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.460 
cloths I've probably said it a hundred
times<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.459> other<00:02:12.640> videos<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> summer<00:02:14.260> is

square<00:03:46.120> foot<00:03:46.510> areas<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.319> we're<00:03:47.950> using<00:03:48.310> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
square foot areas and we're using a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.090 
square foot areas and we're using a
total<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.850> three<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.359> them<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:50.410> greenhouse<00:03:50.889> is

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
total of three of them the greenhouse is

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.190 
total of three of them the greenhouse is
just<00:03:51.430> over<00:03:51.790> 1,300<00:03:52.269> square<00:03:52.600> feet<00:03:52.959> so

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
just over 1,300 square feet so

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.140 
just over 1,300 square feet so
theoretically<00:03:53.470> we<00:03:53.980> have<00:03:54.190> far<00:03:54.489> more<00:03:54.519> cooling

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
theoretically we have far more cooling

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.850 
theoretically we have far more cooling
capacity<00:03:55.720> than<00:03:55.870> we<00:03:55.900> need

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
capacity than we need

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.070 
capacity than we need
