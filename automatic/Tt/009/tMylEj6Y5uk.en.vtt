00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
come in that's a totally different

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
come in that's a totally different
concept<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.810> over<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.500> weeks<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
concept to me over the first two weeks I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
concept to me over the first two weeks I
was<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.369> classroom<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.210> sat<00:01:39.420> there

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
was in one classroom I just sat there

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.600 
was in one classroom I just sat there
and<00:01:39.869> did<00:01:40.409> nothing<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.030> finally

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
and did nothing then I finally

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.500 
and did nothing then I finally
finally<00:01:44.420> got<00:01:45.200> my<00:01:45.470> schedule<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.150> have<00:01:47.480> a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
finally got my schedule so I have a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.350 
finally got my schedule so I have a
schedule<00:01:48.110> because<00:01:48.640> I'm<00:01:49.640> an<00:01:49.880> exchange<00:01:50.240> student

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
schedule because I'm an exchange student

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.240 
schedule because I'm an exchange student
so<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:50.810> kind<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.200> different<00:01:51.500> situation<00:01:51.650> so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
so it's kind of a different situation so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.640 
so it's kind of a different situation so
I<00:01:52.280> do<00:01:52.490> move<00:01:53.120> different<00:01:53.750> classes<00:01:54.140> each<00:01:54.410> hour

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
I do move different classes each hour

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.370 
I do move different classes each hour
because<00:01:55.460> I'm<00:01:56.090> not<00:01:56.420> taking<00:01:56.840> Greek<00:01:57.110> or<00:01:57.350> Latin

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
because I'm not taking Greek or Latin

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.790 
because I'm not taking Greek or Latin
instead<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.340> have<00:01:58.970> my<00:01:59.810> own<00:01:59.990> classes<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:00.680> have

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
instead I have my own classes so I have

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.020 
instead I have my own classes so I have
to<00:02:00.860> go<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.040> different<00:02:01.250> rooms<00:02:01.580> for<00:02:01.820> different

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
to go to different rooms for different

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.530 
to go to different rooms for different
things<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.110> for<00:02:03.530> example<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.280> take<00:02:04.670> three

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
things so for example I take three

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.580 
things so for example I take three
English<00:02:05.990> classes<00:02:06.670> two<00:02:07.670> math<00:02:07.940> classes<00:02:08.590> three

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
English classes two math classes three

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.420 
English classes two math classes three
art<00:02:10.070> classes<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.300> like<00:02:11.480> art<00:02:11.720> history

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
art classes and it's like art history

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.360 
art classes and it's like art history
science<00:02:13.430> class<00:02:13.760> history<00:02:14.120> class<00:02:14.420> religion<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.200 

fine

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
fine

don't stressful until 9 so it's pretty

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.540

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that aspect of things another really big

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.070 
that aspect of things another really big
thing<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.550> style<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.330> learning<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:48.960> at

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
thing is the style of learning here at

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.490 
thing is the style of learning here at
least<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.410> my<00:02:49.530> school<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.080> much<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.470> a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
least in my school it's not so much as a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.960 
least in my school it's not so much as a
hands-on<00:02:53.220> approach<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.290> lecture

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
hands-on approach it's more of a lecture

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.670 
hands-on approach it's more of a lecture
style<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.330> teaching<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.080> teacher<00:02:58.290> reads

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
style of teaching so the teacher reads

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.280 
style of teaching so the teacher reads
you<00:02:59.490> take<00:02:59.760> notes<00:03:00.030> they<00:03:00.360> talk<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.660> take<00:03:01.020> notes

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
you take notes they talk you take notes

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.350 
you take notes they talk you take notes

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
all these things and it was just weird

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.180 
all these things and it was just weird
because<00:06:52.760> if<00:06:53.510> you<00:06:54.020> showed<00:06:54.260> up<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.530> school<00:06:54.710> in

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
because if you showed up to school in

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.230 
because if you showed up to school in
America<00:06:56.030> with<00:06:56.330> a<00:06:56.510> fake<00:06:56.840> gun<00:06:57.289> or<00:06:57.620> fake<00:06:58.190> weed<00:06:58.970> or

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
America with a fake gun or fake weed or

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.820 
America with a fake gun or fake weed or
cocaine<00:06:59.720> or<00:06:59.840> alcohol<00:06:59.930> or<00:07:00.169> anything<00:07:00.440> like<00:07:00.680> you

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
cocaine or alcohol or anything like you

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.620 
cocaine or alcohol or anything like you
would<00:07:00.919> be<00:07:01.039> expelled<00:07:01.490> so<00:07:02.030> I<00:07:02.060> think<00:07:02.120> it's<00:07:02.330> so

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
would be expelled so I think it's so

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.900 
would be expelled so I think it's so
interesting<00:07:03.560> to<00:07:04.160> see<00:07:04.400> the<00:07:04.520> cultural

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
interesting to see the cultural

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.600 
interesting to see the cultural
differences<00:07:05.479> between<00:07:06.370> things<00:07:07.370> that<00:07:07.520> have

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
differences between things that have

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.300 
differences between things that have
happened<00:07:07.789> in<00:07:08.060> America<00:07:08.450> causing<00:07:09.050> even<00:07:09.950> a<00:07:10.100> fake

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
happened in America causing even a fake

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.779 
happened in America causing even a fake
