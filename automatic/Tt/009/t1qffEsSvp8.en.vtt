00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.110 

think<00:03:09.680> they're<00:03:09.860> going<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.069> say<00:03:10.280> he's<00:03:10.430> down<00:03:13.120> but

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.729 
think they're going to say he's down but
we'll<00:03:14.299> take<00:03:14.510> another<00:03:14.569> look<00:03:15.019> at<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.260> that's<00:03:15.530> for

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
we'll take another look at it that's for

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.360 
we'll take another look at it that's for

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
not this is a fumble and that will be

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:35.130 
not this is a fumble and that will be
reviewed

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.320 

where<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.069> he<00:03:36.280> out<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.580> balance<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> ball<00:03:37.300> is

where is he out of balance the ball is

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.600 
where is he out of balance the ball is
clearly<00:03:37.870> out<00:03:38.200> now<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.560> question<00:03:38.980> may<00:03:39.250> become

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
clearly out now the question may become

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.600 
clearly out now the question may become
Eric<00:03:39.880> if<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.120> step<00:03:40.390> out<00:03:40.569> of<00:03:40.600> bounds<00:03:41.310> watch<00:03:42.310> his

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
Eric if you step out of bounds watch his

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.280 
Eric if you step out of bounds watch his
foot<00:03:42.910> does<00:03:43.150> he<00:03:43.270> step<00:03:43.510> out<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.690> bounds<00:03:43.930> before

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
foot does he step out of bounds before

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.920 
foot does he step out of bounds before
the<00:03:44.770> fumble<00:03:45.190> right<00:03:45.370> there<00:03:45.819> that<00:03:46.660> looks

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the fumble right there that looks

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.210 
the fumble right there that looks
clearly<00:03:47.319> out<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.620> bounds<00:03:48.100> before<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.640> fumble

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
clearly out of bounds before the fumble

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.680 
clearly out of bounds before the fumble
there's<00:03:51.220> no<00:03:51.370> doubt<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.150> a<00:03:52.270> fumble

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
there's no doubt that that is a fumble

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.420 
there's no doubt that that is a fumble
but<00:03:52.810> look<00:03:53.020> at<00:03:53.140> his<00:03:53.290> left<00:03:53.560> foot<00:03:53.800> does<00:03:54.010> he<00:03:54.160> step

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
but look at his left foot does he step

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.980 
but look at his left foot does he step
out<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.670> bounds<00:03:55.230> there<00:03:56.340> or<00:03:57.340> they're<00:03:57.810> both<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
out of bounds there or they're both the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.140 
out of bounds there or they're both the
left<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.590> right<00:03:59.680> foot<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.370> think<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.970> best

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
left and the right foot I think the best

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.910 
left and the right foot I think the best
angle<00:04:01.390> is<00:04:01.660> from<00:04:01.870> behind<00:04:02.200> him<00:04:02.470> right<00:04:02.680> along

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
angle is from behind him right along

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.000 
angle is from behind him right along
that<00:04:02.950> side<00:04:03.459> line<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:05.260> ball<00:04:05.380> definitely<00:04:05.830> came

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
that side line the ball definitely came

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.590 
that side line the ball definitely came
out<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:06.370> depends<00:04:06.910> on<00:04:07.060> whether<00:04:07.300> or<00:04:07.390> not<00:04:07.450> he

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
out it just depends on whether or not he

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.240 
out it just depends on whether or not he
had<00:04:07.690> stepped<00:04:08.020> that<00:04:08.200> about<00:04:08.410> before<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:08.980> did

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
had stepped that about before it did

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.490 
had stepped that about before it did
yeah<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.940> angle<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.440> remember<00:04:11.440> it

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
yeah this is the angle and remember it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.280 
yeah this is the angle and remember it
has<00:04:11.709> to<00:04:11.890> be<00:04:12.010> indisputable<00:04:12.810> Vizard<00:04:13.810> visual

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
has to be indisputable Vizard visual

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.370 
has to be indisputable Vizard visual
evidence<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:16.390> foot<00:04:16.840> out<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.200> that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
evidence is that foot out is that

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.180 
evidence is that foot out is that
indisputable<00:04:18.250> visual<00:04:18.430> evidence<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:20.190> believe

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
indisputable visual evidence I believe

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.130 
indisputable visual evidence I believe
it<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.519> think<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.790> clearly<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.480> but<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:23.020> can

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
it I think it clearly is but you can

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.840 
it I think it clearly is but you can
even<00:04:23.230> see<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.590> mark<00:04:23.830> there<00:04:24.010> out<00:04:24.310> there<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.730> go

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
even see the mark there out there you go
