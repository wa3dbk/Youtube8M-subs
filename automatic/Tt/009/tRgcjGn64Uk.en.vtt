00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.559 
have now may we have lose you have imp
and<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.440> far<00:02:16.709> imp<00:02:16.950> has<00:02:17.160> probably<00:02:18.000> been<00:02:18.209> looking

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
and so far imp has probably been looking

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.240 
and so far imp has probably been looking
the<00:02:18.660> best<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.080> Lucy<00:02:19.349> being<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.650> close<00:02:19.860> second

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the best with Lucy being a close second

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.040 
the best with Lucy being a close second
even<00:02:20.489> though<00:02:20.580> supposedly<00:02:21.330> he<00:02:21.510> walked<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
even though supposedly he walked up and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.210 
even though supposedly he walked up and
called<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> best<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.130> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
called it was the best but I think that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220 
called it was the best but I think that
he's<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.550> marking<00:02:23.849> his<00:02:23.970> target<00:02:24.330> you're<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
he's just marking his target you're the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.020 
he's just marking his target you're the
best<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:25.860> gonna<00:02:25.950> kill<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:26.880> the
