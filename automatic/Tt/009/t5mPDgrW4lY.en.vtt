00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 welcome home so for this little 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 boxing man of the gie 29 force of home 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 logitech the new steering wheel no 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:22.260
 ps3 ps4 compatible and pc then pc it's 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.630
 already not put on the box because the g 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 920 of logitech also one there is going to be 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 specialized in the xbox one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 even the exclusivity of this appellation 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 yet this wheel and although we skate 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 with the three machines have ps3 ps4 and 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 pc then suddenly a little unboxing 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.340
 fast your habit we'll do that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:01:01.469
 as simply as possible 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:04.949
 hop there then there is already a carton 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.439
 interior of protection what is a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.920
 first at logitech usually we have 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.229
 tian cardboard for everything simple there in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 does this is called a thing that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.450
 so they took a generic carton 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 and they put around this little dress 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.990
 with a little bit of a visual then to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.990
 inside we find here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 the combine well forget it's there 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.869
 the coco the g29 then is what's left 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.690
 something power and in checks for 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:56.360
 or on the screen that moment is another there 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.330
 there is nothing at all not even the notice 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.140
 for now I have not had to appreciate via 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:09.979
 apparently ena says anything 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:13.060
 this attack and then later on 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.060
 with you 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 that's this pretty actively the most 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.460
 simply from the world we really 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.550
 packed a report to versus home 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.640
 this race masters I was 300 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.320
 addresses but t500rs it was better 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.290
 protected in their cartons cartons 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.690
 it was a bit more durable but 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.330
 it's not bad anyway 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.580
 here is the little calf where she is very 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.090
 pretty a really made me a very 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.090
 very good impression 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.710
 when I was able to test it forward 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.380
 first 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.290
 he really is really really very 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.630
 nice comeback very well we'll put some 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.630
 side and we will attack with the gym 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.600
 what is the pedals 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.710
 then I'll ask one I ask you to 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:15.480
 second attention tac you hear me 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.370
 still here is here the pedal 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.730
 wake me I already large 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.400
 paluch so it's beautiful he's mental 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.180
 it's pretty heavy there my opinion well these 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.670
 two kilos and with a new flu 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 new logo the new logo from 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.680
 logitech with the g that changed that makes 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 a little more sober and diet 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:46.230
 separated with 5 to 10 680 and so on 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.209
 note that there is no lift 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.130
 of speed they did not send me the 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.470
 shifter so I will 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.450
 talk about it with my memories of the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.440
 preview so far so it was for that 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.570
 which is the record 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.420
 it smells a little rush because 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.430
 So that's the first part 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.850
 of a matisse and that's the second 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.850
 part 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.570
 just illegible and with jude and to 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:26.430
 the security artist we see the notice 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.250
 of use both dreamed about wings and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.540
 front billion on top is that the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.810
 visual is like at ikea and that makes 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.560
 a little cheap anyway it must be said 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.139
 I'll leave you 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.080
 and I give you an appointment for the 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.289
 directly in the article to more 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.289
 late
