00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.629 

identify<00:00:01.560> which<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.190> following<00:00:02.340> numbers

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
identify which of the following numbers

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.840 
identify which of the following numbers
are<00:00:03.120> integers<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:04.020> then<00:00:04.560> plot<00:00:04.980> them<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
are integers and then plot them on the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.900 
are integers and then plot them on the
number<00:00:06.060> line<00:00:06.319> so<00:00:07.319> integers<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.519> best<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:08.880> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
number line so integers the best way to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.430 
number line so integers the best way to
think<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.330> them<00:00:09.480> they're<00:00:09.870> really<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
think of them they're really the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.379 
think of them they're really the
counting<00:00:10.950> numbers<00:00:11.099> or<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> natural<00:00:12.059> numbers

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
counting numbers or the natural numbers

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.790 
counting numbers or the natural numbers
plus<00:00:12.620> 0<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.960> opposite<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
plus 0 and the and the opposite of the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
plus 0 and the and the opposite of the
counting<00:00:17.190> numbers<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> counting<00:00:18.119> numbers

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
counting numbers so the counting numbers

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
counting numbers so the counting numbers
are<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:18.750> 1<00:00:19.020> 2<00:00:19.800> 3<00:00:20.660> 4<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:22.800> forth<00:00:23.100> if

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
are like 1 2 3 4 so on and so forth if

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
are like 1 2 3 4 so on and so forth if
you<00:00:23.760> add<00:00:23.939> zero<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you add zero to it you then get the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
you add zero to it you then get the
whole<00:00:26.099> numbers<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.960> want

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
whole numbers and then to that you want

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.960 
whole numbers and then to that you want
to<00:00:28.230> add<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.650> negative<00:00:28.890> counting<00:00:29.550> numbers<00:00:29.849> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to add the negative counting numbers or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.030 
to add the negative counting numbers or
the<00:00:30.090> opposite<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> natural<00:00:31.439> numbers<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the opposite of the natural numbers so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.880 
the opposite of the natural numbers so
the<00:00:32.790> opposite<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> 1<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> negative<00:00:34.320> 1<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the opposite of 1 is negative 1 the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
the opposite of 1 is negative 1 the
opposite<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.430> 2<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.969> negative<00:00:36.450> 2<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.200> opposite

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
opposite of 2 is negative 2 the opposite

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.610 
opposite of 2 is negative 2 the opposite
of<00:00:37.680> 3<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.160> negative<00:00:38.190> 3<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.200> forth<00:00:40.500> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of 3 is negative 3 so on and so forth so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.799 
of 3 is negative 3 so on and so forth so
let's<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.730> integers<00:00:42.180> 5

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
let's see which of these are integers 5

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.160 
let's see which of these are integers 5
is<00:00:43.110> definitely<00:00:43.680> an<00:00:43.860> integer<00:00:44.329> zero<00:00:45.329> point<00:00:45.690> 3<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is definitely an integer zero point 3 is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
is definitely an integer zero point 3 is
not<00:00:46.469> an<00:00:46.680> integer<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> these<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
not an integer it is not one of these I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
not an integer it is not one of these I
guess<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> could<00:00:49.710> call<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.270> either

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
guess you could call it it is not either

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
guess you could call it it is not either
a<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.559> natural<00:00:53.160> counting<00:00:53.610> number<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> not

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
natural counting number negative two is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.010 
natural counting number negative two is
an<00:00:58.680> integer<00:00:59.270> negative<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.600> an<00:01:00.750> integer

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
an integer negative two is an integer

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
an integer negative two is an integer
it's<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.129> over<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.640> wrote<00:01:02.910> it

it's right over here actually wrote it

it's right over here actually wrote it
down<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:03.420> example<00:01:03.830> negative<00:01:04.830> 1/3<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.700> not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
an integer for the same reason that

an integer for the same reason that
point<00:01:07.560> zero<00:01:07.860> point<00:01:08.159> three<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.030> one

point zero point three is it's not one

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
point zero point three is it's not one
of<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.659> natural<00:01:10.409> counting<00:01:10.740> numbers

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of these natural counting numbers

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
of these natural counting numbers
they're<00:01:11.340> negatives<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.970> zero<00:01:12.720> negative<00:01:13.530> one

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
they're negatives or zero negative one

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
they're negatives or zero negative one
point<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.460> once<00:01:15.030> again<00:01:15.390> once<00:01:16.290> again<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.860> not

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
point two once again once again it's not

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.820 
point two once again once again it's not
a<00:01:17.130> whole<00:01:17.759> number<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> negative<00:01:19.200> natural

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
a whole number or a negative natural

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
a whole number or a negative natural
number<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> guess<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.240> about

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
number I guess is one way to think about

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.010 
number I guess is one way to think about
it<00:01:21.950> zero<00:01:22.950> zero<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.939> included<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> set<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it zero zero is included in the set of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
it zero zero is included in the set of
integers<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.560> I'll<00:01:25.650> stick<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.369> too

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
integers so I'll stick that there too

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
integers so I'll stick that there too
definitely<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> things<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.470> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
definitely is one of the things that I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.590 
definitely is one of the things that I
drew<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.860> example

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
drew as an example

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
drew as an example

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
9/7 is not it's between it's between

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.499 
9/7 is not it's between it's between
actual<00:01:34.070> integers<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.310> we'll<00:01:35.939> plot<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.240> here

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
actual integers and we'll plot it here

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.370 
actual integers and we'll plot it here
on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> number<00:01:36.810> line

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
on the number line

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
on the number line
for<00:01:37.710> point<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.700> integer<00:01:38.909> once<00:01:39.299> again

for point one not an integer once again

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140 
for point one not an integer once again
because<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.650> doesn't<00:01:40.860> evenly<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
because it's not it doesn't evenly or it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.080 
because it's not it doesn't evenly or it
doesn't<00:01:42.299> land<00:01:42.899> exactly<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.700> either

zero and then negative 3 it is an
integer<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.920> drew<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.640> an

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
integer actually drew it here as an

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.270 
integer actually drew it here as an
example<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.479> let's<00:01:51.689> plot<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> these<00:01:52.500> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
example so let's plot all of these so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
example so let's plot all of these so
first<00:01:53.520> I'll<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.880> five<00:01:54.149> pretty

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
first I'll do five pretty

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.980 
first I'll do five pretty
straightforward<00:01:55.530> 5<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.430> over<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:57.060> 5

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
straightforward 5 is right over here 5

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
straightforward 5 is right over here 5
is<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.060> 0.3<00:02:01.100> 0.3<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is right over here 0.3 0.3 so this is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
is right over here 0.3 0.3 so this is
going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.290> less<00:02:04.500> than

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
going to be a little bit less than

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.399 
going to be a little bit less than
one-third<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.640> 0.3<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.140> right

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
one-third so 0.3 is going to be right

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.510 
one-third so 0.3 is going to be right
over<00:02:07.680> there

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
over there

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.790 
over there
so<00:02:09.379> 0.3<00:02:10.580> then<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:12.060> negative<00:02:12.750> 2

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so 0.3 then we have negative 2

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520 
so 0.3 then we have negative 2
let<00:02:14.130> me<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.370> negative<00:02:14.550> 2<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.090> blue<00:02:15.420> negative<00:02:16.320> 2

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
let me do negative 2 in blue negative 2

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.280 
let me do negative 2 in blue negative 2
is<00:02:16.740> 2<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.430> left<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.970> 0<00:02:18.270> right<00:02:18.750> over<00:02:18.990> there

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
is 2 to the left of 0 right over there

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.850 
is 2 to the left of 0 right over there
actually<00:02:19.440> already<00:02:19.830> labeled<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.420> negative<00:02:21.420> 2

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
actually already labeled it negative 2

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.800 
actually already labeled it negative 2
1/3<00:02:22.880> 1/3<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.060> you'd<00:02:24.210> wrote<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> decimal

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
1/3 1/3 if you'd wrote it as a decimal

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.770 
1/3 1/3 if you'd wrote it as a decimal
is<00:02:25.410> zero<00:02:25.740> point<00:02:26.010> 3<00:02:26.250> 3<00:02:26.280> 3<00:02:26.550> 3<00:02:26.760> 3<00:02:26.940> 3<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
is zero point 3 3 3 3 3 3 so on and so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.120 
is zero point 3 3 3 3 3 3 so on and so
forth<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.620> bigger<00:02:28.890> than

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
forth so it's a little bit bigger than

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.980 
forth so it's a little bit bigger than
zero<00:02:29.490> point<00:02:29.580> three<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.180> I'll<00:02:30.330> put<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.690> right

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
zero point three so I'll put it right

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.930 
zero point three so I'll put it right
over<00:02:31.050> there<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> little<00:02:32.370> bit<00:02:32.520> bigger<00:02:32.850> that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
over there it's a little bit bigger that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.470 
over there it's a little bit bigger that
would<00:02:33.240> be<00:02:33.360> 1/3<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.440> then<00:02:35.100> negative<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:36.090> point

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
would be 1/3 and then negative one point

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.350 
would be 1/3 and then negative one point
two<00:02:37.190> negative<00:02:38.190> one<00:02:38.220> point<00:02:38.760> two<00:02:39.000> I'll<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.270> two

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
two negative one point two I'll do two

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.020 
two negative one point two I'll do two
this<00:02:39.510> blue<00:02:39.870> color<00:02:40.220> negative<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.460> point<00:02:41.730> two

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
this blue color negative one point two

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.060 
this blue color negative one point two
well<00:02:42.660> negative<00:02:42.840> one<00:02:43.260> takes<00:02:43.530> us<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.890> then

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
well negative one takes us there then

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.410 
well negative one takes us there then
we're<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.520> another<00:02:44.730> point<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
we're gonna have to go another point to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780 
we're gonna have to go another point to
or<00:02:45.660> another<00:02:45.870> 1/5<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.770> negative<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.370> point<00:02:47.580> two

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
or another 1/5 so negative one point two

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.490 
or another 1/5 so negative one point two
will<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.120> us<00:02:48.240> right<00:02:48.420> over<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.870> negative<00:02:49.290> one

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
will get us right over here negative one

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.370 
will get us right over here negative one
point<00:02:49.890> two<00:02:50.100> zero<00:02:51.050> that's<00:02:52.050> pretty

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
point two zero that's pretty

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.740 
point two zero that's pretty
straightforward<00:02:52.800> zero<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.910> right<00:02:54.240> over<00:02:54.420> there

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
straightforward zero is right over there

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.890 
straightforward zero is right over there
too<00:02:55.500> once<00:02:56.250> again<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:57.000> too<00:02:57.240> difficult

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
too once again not too difficult

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.190 
too once again not too difficult
two<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.290> two<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.860> right<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.370> zero<00:03:00.200> nine

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
two is two to the right of zero nine

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.170 
two is two to the right of zero nine
seven<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:02.340> written<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.760> an<00:03:02.970> improper

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
seven it's written as an improper

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.050 
seven it's written as an improper
fraction<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.800> might<00:03:05.040> recognize<00:03:05.220> 7<00:03:05.880> goes

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
fraction and you might recognize 7 goes

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.750 
fraction and you might recognize 7 goes
into<00:03:06.090> 9<00:03:06.450> one<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.470> has<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.830> left<00:03:08.130> over<00:03:08.340> so

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
into 9 one time and has two left over so

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.950 
into 9 one time and has two left over so
9<00:03:09.300> over<00:03:09.840> 7<00:03:10.290> 9<00:03:11.250> over<00:03:11.730> seven<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.330> same<00:03:12.660> thing

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
9 over 7 9 over seven is the same thing

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.080 
9 over 7 9 over seven is the same thing
7<00:03:13.290> goes<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.500> 9<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:13.920> time<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.370> has<00:03:14.490> two<00:03:14.760> left

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
7 goes to 9 one time and has two left

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.810 
7 goes to 9 one time and has two left
over<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.020> two<00:03:16.260> sevenths<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.700> we

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
over so it's one and two sevenths so we

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.360 
over so it's one and two sevenths so we
go<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:17.970> one<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.570> then<00:03:18.959> with<00:03:19.140> 2/7<00:03:20.010> that's<00:03:20.250> gonna

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
go to one and then with 2/7 that's gonna

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.970 
go to one and then with 2/7 that's gonna
get<00:03:20.580> us<00:03:20.640> right<00:03:21.060> about<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.380> 2/7

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
get us right about there so one in 2/7

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.760 
get us right about there so one in 2/7
is<00:03:23.100> gonna<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.459> right<00:03:23.640> about<00:03:23.910> there

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
is gonna be right about there

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.810 
is gonna be right about there
4.1<00:03:26.570> 4.1<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.020> little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.770> more<00:03:28.950> than<00:03:29.220> 4<00:03:29.520> so

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
4.1 4.1 is a little bit more than 4 so

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.190 
4.1 4.1 is a little bit more than 4 so
it'll<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.090> right<00:03:30.390> over<00:03:30.540> there<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.930> tenth

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
it'll be right over there it's a tenth

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.050 
it'll be right over there it's a tenth
more<00:03:31.440> than<00:03:31.650> 4<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> tenth<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.490> way<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> 5

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
more than 4 it's a tenth of the way to 5

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.320 
more than 4 it's a tenth of the way to 5
so<00:03:33.959> 4.1<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.920> right<00:03:35.130> over<00:03:35.310> there<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.820> then

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
so 4.1 is right over there and then

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.960 
so 4.1 is right over there and then
finally<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.350> negative<00:03:37.860> 3<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.760> just

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
finally we have negative 3 that is just
