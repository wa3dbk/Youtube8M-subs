00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
 U 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:27.870
 You 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.870

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.240
 222 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:41.380
 The second special of coffee today is that the Emperor Napoleon enjoyed drinking 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.660
 This year Napoleon yesterday really liked coffee. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.739
 I gather you all. 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:53.379
 08:00 I need a spoon to make a cafe royal. 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:58.629
 Royal's puning know that the left side due to the difference pattern just give him a unique and ssaeka spawn 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:03.340
 I think you see it'm a little awry here before haebolkkayo differences sweat 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.399
 2 I like to hang out on coffee cups. 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.930
 His name is cut . It's Roel Spoon on Sunday evening . 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.340
 It is true that even if this is done from anywhere , 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.600
 Please prepare. 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 And I also like coffee and espresso. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.710
 And then the last coffee is good . It's mainly cappelle coffee with alcohol. 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.780
 Tasty coffee is raised 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:33.340
 I just want you to make a ring of coffees like that, or Canna 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:38.320
 Recommend coffee or Tanzanian coffee and recommend it as a pot. 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.220
 If you have good or else you have an espresso made from our mocha pot 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.340
 You can do it. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.439
 Let's find out once the hot coffee cup of coffee for 10 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.400
 4 Follow the dark coffee . And here's the alcohol . 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:55.119
 I'm not ready to be here today, I went to prepare a moth-line 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 The thumb rum is very tight and strong. 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.440
 You can put 30cc at 10 o'clock. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.940
 I'll take a look at the cafe or stone. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.530
 I'll put a 30cc. 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 Look at the line of the phone in the cafe. Put it across the spoon. 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.180
 I 'm putting up one for everybody here. 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.710
 It does not matter what it is . 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.970
 You're on a weekly basis. 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:29.190
 Here's a highlighter from now on . 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.459
 I'm attaching an inflamed fire back here just sugar that thumbs 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.550
 Sugar will be high while forming a tower. 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:43.320
 Then you waited for release to melt the bar. 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.150
 If you like a great book, Can I invite people who flew so far this sugar has melted 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.040
 Will be mixed with the Lord 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.270
 So this icon Sophie drank so much so that it hit embellish 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.510
 I'm correlation seen so many methods take out the amount of alcohol without distillation 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.510
 It's possible 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.770
 It's all melted now, then 5s professional. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.940
 Stir'll give me coffee and other input Gray 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.569
 Stir the rest of your coffee and your thumb and then your quickie. 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.510
 You have to. 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:22.340
 Oh yeah yeah then the strong taste of the week and then the sweetness of sugar 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.480
 However , I feel a deep smell in the nose and produce a very fantastic feeling 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.480
 I think it's coffee. 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.360
 er 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.360
