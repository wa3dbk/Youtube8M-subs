00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you will touch them a little bit but

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.170 
you will touch them a little bit but

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they won't stand out as much as they're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
they won't stand out as much as they're
doing<00:01:12.450> right<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> iphone<00:01:13.409> 5<00:01:13.710> d<00:01:14.340> 4<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> 4s

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
doing right now the iphone 5 d 4 and 4s

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.380 
doing right now the iphone 5 d 4 and 4s
so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.380> first<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.490> kind

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so you can see here first that this kind

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.289 
so you can see here first that this kind
of<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> mute<00:01:18.900> switch<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.590> they

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
of like the mute switch and they

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.179 
of like the mute switch and they
redesign<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.960> easier<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> adjust

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
redesign it so it's easier now to adjust

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.749 
redesign it so it's easier now to adjust
on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> phone<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.830> easier<00:01:26.280> because<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
on the phone it's easier because it's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.359 
on the phone it's easier because it's
the<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.150> direction<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.250> see

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the other direction here you can see

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.940 
the other direction here you can see
plus<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> minus<00:01:30.450> buttons<00:01:30.710> here<00:01:31.710> also

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
plus and minus buttons here also

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.940 
plus and minus buttons here also
probably<00:01:32.850> feels<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.600> better

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
probably feels a little bit better

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
probably feels a little bit better
because<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.310> bigger<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.119> probably

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
because they are bigger so probably

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.200 
because they are bigger so probably
easier<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> touch<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.220> home<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
easier to touch and you home or the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
easier to touch and you home or the
power<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> button<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> top<00:01:40.409> steel<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
power on button at the top steel but the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
power on button at the top steel but the
dedicated<00:01:41.520> camera<00:01:41.759> button<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.630> probably

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
dedicated camera button would probably

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
dedicated camera button would probably
maybe<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.220> cool<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
maybe be a little bit cool because it's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
maybe be a little bit cool because it's
really<00:01:45.780> cool<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> button<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
really cool there to have a button like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.639 
really cool there to have a button like
that<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.460> they've<00:01:47.880> also<00:01:48.030> navigated<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.229> new

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that and they've also navigated some new

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
that and they've also navigated some new

easier to clean off your iphone because

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.170 
easier to clean off your iphone because
you<00:01:54.990> can't<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.920> water<00:01:56.280> inside<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you can't get like water inside of the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.179 
you can't get like water inside of the
home<00:01:57.509> button<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
home button because now you can see that

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
home button because now you can see that
they<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.939> buttons<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> sides

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
they have to like buttons on the sides

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.770 
they have to like buttons on the sides
that<00:02:01.680> almost<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.880> every<00:02:03.149> single<00:02:03.420> android

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that almost like every single android

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
that almost like every single android
device<00:02:03.990> has<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.040> good<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> could

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
device has and this is good for it could

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.860 
device has and this is good for it could
be<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> menu<00:02:06.479> about

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
be like a menu about

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.320 
be like a menu about
button<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.620> back<00:02:08.100> button<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.150> really

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
button or go back button and I really

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.760 
button or go back button and I really
think<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.570> could<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.930> useful<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.590> like

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
think that could be useful to have like

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
think that could be useful to have like
a<00:02:10.800> menu<00:02:11.040> key<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.400> something<00:02:11.430> inside<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.330> an

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
a menu key or something inside of an

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.010 
a menu key or something inside of an
iphone<00:02:12.540> iphone<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:14.340> future<00:02:14.820> iphone<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
iphone iphone in a future iphone and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.990 
iphone iphone in a future iphone and
also<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.830> takes<00:02:16.980> more<00:02:17.340> advantage<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
also it takes more advantage of the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520 
also it takes more advantage of the
screen<00:02:18.240> because<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.780> screen<00:02:19.110> space<00:02:19.320> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
screen because that screen space is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620 
screen because that screen space is
always<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.070> there<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:21.030> why<00:02:21.300> not<00:02:21.330> have

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
always going to be there so why not have

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.510 
always going to be there so why not have
buttons<00:02:22.170> there<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> looks<00:02:23.280> kind<00:02:23.490> of

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
buttons there and looks kind of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.180 
buttons there and looks kind of
attractive<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> big<00:02:25.470> lcb<00:02:25.980> like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
attractive here so like it big lcb like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.160 
attractive here so like it big lcb like
touch<00:02:26.400> panel<00:02:26.850> something<00:02:27.210> at<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> bottom

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
touch panel something at the bottom

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.920 
touch panel something at the bottom
there<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.740> would<00:02:29.370> love<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.570> also<00:02:30.690> see

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
an indoor cpu intel xeon x5 chip so I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.910 
an indoor cpu intel xeon x5 chip so I
mean<00:04:55.390> like<00:04:55.540> instant<00:04:56.020> load<00:04:56.350> time<00:04:56.680> and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
mean like instant load time and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.790 
mean like instant load time and
everything<00:04:57.130> when<00:04:57.550> you're<00:04:57.700> loading<00:04:58.090> stuff<00:04:58.300> up

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
everything when you're loading stuff up

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.130 
everything when you're loading stuff up
also<00:04:59.800> a<00:05:00.100> better<00:05:00.670> graphics<00:05:01.240> performance<00:05:01.450> here

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
also a better graphics performance here

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.960 
also a better graphics performance here
