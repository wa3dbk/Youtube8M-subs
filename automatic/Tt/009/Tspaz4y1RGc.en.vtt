00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
to talk it's almost cured me of my

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
to talk it's almost cured me of my
talking<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> myself<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.750> good<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
talking to myself which is good but I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820 
talking to myself which is good but I
was<00:01:05.700> losing<00:01:05.909> weight<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> thought<00:01:07.560> Lord

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
was losing weight and so I thought Lord

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.060 
was losing weight and so I thought Lord
this<00:01:08.070> can't<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.520> much<00:01:08.790> longer<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:10.619> had

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this can't go on much longer and I had

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
this can't go on much longer and I had
been<00:01:11.220> avoiding<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.790> kombucha<00:01:12.720> tea<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
been avoiding this kombucha tea that I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.460 
been avoiding this kombucha tea that I
was<00:01:13.380> drinking<00:01:13.909> because<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.659> fermented<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
was drinking because it's fermented and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
was drinking because it's fermented and
it<00:01:16.799> tastes<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.070> vinegar<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.759> thought<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it tastes like vinegar and I thought it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
it tastes like vinegar and I thought it
had<00:01:18.240> acid<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.350> was<00:01:19.530> causing<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.040> mouth<00:01:20.280> also

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
had acid that was causing the mouth also

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.719 
had acid that was causing the mouth also
