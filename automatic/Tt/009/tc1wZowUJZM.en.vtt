00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.530
 the sewage charge is gambled here 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.270
 but the sell but some problems give what subsequently migrated 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.660
 Also in schools at home is the fans had to connect a stereo 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.659
 under water 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.890
 for the player of Udinese in Worms 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.960
 but to watch a small video 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.949
 no problem 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.589
 then asked the following 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.869
 How does he do that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.210
 For example, when I get the documents they have their browser available 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.750
 I do not know the walls 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 connect a power amplifier in India 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.560
 zol 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.350
 and then we should band the speakers but what not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.320
 yes, that's pretty easy at some point 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.310
 just tactical times 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.120
 in the stage 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.680
 ever canceled 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 So you should watch my videos too 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.210
 not for nothing 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 the classification as you here 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 Rheine in front 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 Berkutschi dapd 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.150
 binding 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.500
 there you can say I wanted to pull 1 with her cheek 2 he does 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 loves homeland 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 in the West usually want to leave the word 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.640
 not that it is here 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.160
 just should have cut off 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
 To make my life this Jason hard 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 Praktiker was the reason who had to open even more 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.220
 no matter where you know you are the most important thing from the point of view of the Jusos 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.970
 big is that's usually a plus 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.079
 05 01 clock 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.640
 but Stoner 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.080
 peaceful development 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.250
 to drive that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 SZ now just not an increased direction Vogtland 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.160
 and also deserve to win 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.110
 you do that to a saying come out dr stereos 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 watch out 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.050
 both players have with the exit 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.840
 Do not do this immediately 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.110
 Most wm players are ordered to send one 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.149
 this India 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.159
 in the northern Spanish Basque Country 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.799
 this one here 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.109
 that reminds you with pretty plugs 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.109
 the bus travelers a decision cases 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.819
 According to spokesman Wiesbaden quite normal 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.209
 clear all speakers 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.039
 with that are 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.909
 you can be almost normal 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.729
 I can only hope 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.529
 the end cut off 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.179
 nobody wants him but Mayer 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.179
 So that's the big topic which channel 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.079
 the two end 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.359
 assist 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.139
 the red house 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.999
 just do not band together for the post 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.209
 So the five old ones and then here wonderful 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.619
 you're even grotesque at the protest 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.619
 on the white slopes, Karl Homann knows 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.709
 that is mostly the river Poprad do not swap there are also phases 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.539
 shift 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.909
 that I'm missing the magic 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.669
 to his stepdaughter 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.999
 just the EDA on 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 the water from my side 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.759
 that so 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.759
 until that's really not rocket science 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.989
 Lopez the 7th 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.269
 I was pretty easy way into the manual 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.629
 amplified a power amp or any occasion 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 yes I realize now here because of Euro Euro 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.029
 the winner came from the place the communal made mostly come 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:38.610
 previous week 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.799
 But countries should have consequences 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.549
 offers me the opportunity me so sure about me 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.549
 I'm looking for a new apartment, he says 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.289
 to fulfill secular 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.649
 BÃ¼ttelborn create jobs 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.099
 Schonberger should 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.549
 except 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.699
 she moved
