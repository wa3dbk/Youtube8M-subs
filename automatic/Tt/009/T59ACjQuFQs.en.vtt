do blog have a Christmas collection I
don't<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.190> out<00:01:11.370> here<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.850> America

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

is<00:01:12.540> coming<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
is coming out but it's not here in the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.000 
is coming out but it's not here in the
UK<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> yet<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
UK as of yet but I got the two that I

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.200 
UK as of yet but I got the two that I
could<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.930> happy<00:01:19.380> harvest

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
could and the first one is happy harvest

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
could and the first one is happy harvest
which<00:01:21.210> obviously<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.810> curved<00:01:22.680> Wilton<00:01:23.130> related

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
which obviously is curved Wilton related

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719 
which obviously is curved Wilton related
and<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.049> all<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.380> Doodlebug<00:01:25.680> papers<00:01:26.460> are

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and so all of Doodlebug papers are

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.719 
and so all of Doodlebug papers are
double-sided<00:01:27.950> do<00:01:28.950> Dibakar<00:01:29.220> known<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.610> their

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
double-sided do Dibakar known for their

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.859 
double-sided do Dibakar known for their
bright<00:01:30.120> colors<00:01:31.400> I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.240> collection<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
bright colors I think this collection is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340 
bright colors I think this collection is
a<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.110> busier<00:01:34.440> than<00:01:35.510> their<00:01:36.510> usual<00:01:36.720> colors<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
a bit busier than their usual colors and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.930 
a bit busier than their usual colors and
maybe<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.130> usual<00:01:38.310> designs<00:01:38.729> maybe

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
maybe it like the usual designs maybe

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.370 
maybe it like the usual designs maybe
it's<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> colours<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.170> something

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's just the colours in it or something

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's just the colours in it or something
I'm<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.400> mean<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> these

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I'm not sure but I mean some of these

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.039 
I'm not sure but I mean some of these
are<00:01:43.290> quite<00:01:43.530> busier<00:01:44.340> than<00:01:44.520> maybe<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:45.750> use

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
are quite busier than maybe I would use

00:01:46.049 --> 00:02:00.180 
are quite busier than maybe I would use
the<00:01:46.890> trees<00:01:47.340> there

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.399 

these<00:02:01.190> implants<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.390> mean<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.690> one<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:03.200> for

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
these implants I mean this one here for

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.870 
these implants I mean this one here for
example<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.409> had<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.950> 12<00:02:07.220> by<00:02:07.399> 12<00:02:07.670> I
