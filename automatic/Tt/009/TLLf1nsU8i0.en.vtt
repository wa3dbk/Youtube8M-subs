00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.670
 when the rumors started that it was 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.410
 approached a new version of the successful 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.370
 apple cell phone all 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.809
 We expected that they were returned to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.179
 surprise as they did the first 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.830
 maybe with some kind of brain 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.540
 floating that will accompany us by the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 streets solving all the problems 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.710
 everyday so when finally 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.989
 began to filter the first 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.559
 images and we discover that officially 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.719
 this would be the new iphone many people 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.540
 It feels solved, of course, because 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:36.180
 when you see them for the first time it looks like 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.370
 quite an iphone 4s or even a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 iphone 4 but it is not that you take it in your 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.590
 hands that you realize is much more 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.850
 lightweight much thinner and taller than 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.340
 the previous iphone of the app 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.310
 iPhone5 flower when I really started 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.890
 shine is when you turn on your screen 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.700
 the new screen is 4 inches a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 16% larger than its predecessor and 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.250
 has a resolution of 1,136 x 640 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.199
 pixels this gives more space for the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.060
 visible exploration but lies to the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.100
 developers do not use their apps 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.540
 to take advantage of this many 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.610
 applications are going to see with black coat 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.860
 up and down the good thing is that 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 they are quickly being updates 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 for all the more applications 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 important however this change 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.090
 it greatly benefits that they enjoy 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.680
 movies on your iphone because the new 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.790
 screen allows us to see 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.860
 really the full 16/9 format and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.840
 also changed the color profile and what 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.510
 made more according to a chromatic palette 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 real what is appreciated 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.040
 apart from the screen one of the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.190
 big changes in the new processor 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.230
 a6 that it makes it considerably more 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.170
 fast that the previous model really 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.210
 everything feels instantaneous the iphone 5 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.740
 it's almost 20 grams lighter than its 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.080
 predecessor what could be achieved 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.910
 removing the glass back panel and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 replacing it with aluminum 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.210
 this can add one made the iphone 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 5 was notoriously thinner 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.320
 making an experience of use 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.790
 it improves pretty much there is no effort to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.370
 have in your hand what does much more 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.870
 co2 actions like playing for long hours 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.990
 or be writing for a long time 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.360
 using the mail or the chat another change that 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.030
 after nine years I spoke I have decided 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.100
 change the classic dock connector by one 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 new smaller called lightning 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.710
 these provision according to the company the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.840
 aesthetic change of the phone though 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.240
 had many criticisms most come 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.280
 by the new version of ios 6 the system 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.170
 operative of the iphone and with the problems 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.270
 that this one brought about by changing the system of 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 google maps to maps of africa 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.319
 but this is something that we hope it will 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.909
 resolve very soon since 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.500
 software that can be corrected with 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.390
 updates 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.740
 Another motto that has been reported is a 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.380
 problem on some computers with the 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.450
 wifi stability but at least 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.190
 we have not suffered it seeing that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.750
 it works much faster than any 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.080
 another device that we have here in 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.450
 laboratory 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.280
 he has sent a software tradition 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.170
 to repair this and who had 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 problem have already said before 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.120
 solved another claim the users has 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.980
 been for the rear coverage of 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.780
 aluminum that apparently is less 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.640
 scratch resistant with keys that the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.520
 glass coverage that had the iphone 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.010
 4s however in tests made by 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.250
 foreign media the iphone 5 endured 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.730
 better the blows and falls than the galaxy 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.530
 s3 its main competitor and the truth 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.360
 is that our model has not had 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.340
 any problem in a real use in 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.920
 pockets with keys and currency we have not 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.840
 seen no scratch wants to know more 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.030
 of this new iphone I invite you to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.020
 read the full tribute as always in 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.020
