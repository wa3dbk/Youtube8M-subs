mp7 for black ops 2 it's really powerful
it's<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:20.910> quite<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.180> high<00:00:21.330> fire<00:00:21.630> rate<00:00:21.980> and<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
it's got quite a high fire rate and the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
it's got quite a high fire rate and the
great<00:00:24.420> bonus<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.230> you're<00:00:25.410> really

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
great bonus of it is you're really

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859 
great bonus of it is you're really
really<00:00:25.920> fast<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:26.490> you're<00:00:26.609> playing<00:00:26.869> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
really fast when you're playing so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.240 
really fast when you're playing so
that's<00:00:28.080> why<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> also<00:00:28.529> went<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.890> lightweight

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that's why I also went for lightweight

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's why I also went for lightweight
because<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:29.640> i<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> submachine<00:00:30.449> gun<00:00:30.599> i've

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
because when i use a submachine gun i've

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
because when i use a submachine gun i've
tried<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.679> get<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.250> map<00:00:32.399> as

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
tried to like get around the map as

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.709 
tried to like get around the map as
quickly<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.910> possible<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> be

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
moving as fast as possible because you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.370 
moving as fast as possible because you
don't<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.210> get<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> mobility<00:00:37.170> problems

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
