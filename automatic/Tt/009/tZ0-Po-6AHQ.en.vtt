00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.150
 34 glasses of water for the puree 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.689
 we boil the potatoes in an ounce 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.689
 little girl 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.600
 we cut the carrots 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 we cut the stocking machine 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.390
 we chop the whole machine huaman 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.760
 it has to be that small 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.120
 and now we cut the small piece of 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.120
 chicken meat 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 and eye pulled bones itch all of 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.850
 new in the machine 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.350
 while the potatoes are boiling 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.350
 we put very good cited serve 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.980
 we add the water and cook the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.980
 vegetables 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.319
 and so much 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.319

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.720
 mix and cook well 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.040
 already once the potatoes are boiled 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.550
 we let cool and rescue the meat from 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.550
 the bones 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.010
 Once chopped, we incorporate them into the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.010
 previous preparation 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.030
 we keep the potato peels 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.420
 and nothing more 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.260
 we put them to chop in the machine 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.260
 here 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.470
 once crushed we put it in the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.230

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.340
 and we add the rest of the water 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.520
 we put a little oil in the mold 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:23.759
 We divide the puree into two 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.759
 half we put the base in the mold 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.460
 we place all the filling in the middle 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.110
 with the rest of the mash we cover the part 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.110
 from above in the form of a lid 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.879
