00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.879
 well here we are with rosana but as 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:14.559
 it's very good 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.010
 I really loved the project 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.849
 transition is something new very innovative 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.470
 it's practical and I do not have very good 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.840
 finish 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.480
 The important thing about this is that we eliminate 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.360
 a step of baking this does not lead 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.600
 baked and you can eat can be used 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.460
 perfectly check that I use it as 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.739
 decorative I say manuel that end is not 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.420
 to use it in the center of the plate of the 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.460
 source where we can cut them more than 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.720
 nothing to be decorative and you can 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.720
 put in the microwave 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.250
 the dishes I have not tried but you can 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.519
 put in microwave and nothing happens this 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 and normal washing we hear you in 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.090
 guayana thank you hello good morning 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.830
 good as I told you today's proposal 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
 is to use a product that is called 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.619
 colorless lacquer gum this product is very 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 noble is a lacquer that gives a finish 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.409
 bright and is generally used to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 waterproof parts this product is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.800
 apt to internalize everything that is 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 water sources to make the subject of 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.799
 feng shui ceramic biscuits a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 piece that is going to be out in the open is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.050
 a super noble product and the idea is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.030
 make on these pieces of earthenware a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.130
 decoupage with the common napkin and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.070
 Protect them with colorless shellac 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.440
 which is how I said give a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.039
 waterproofing and total protection 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.340
 I'm going to start here I have a plate of 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.970
 crockery which is already clean is washed 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.420
 is degreased with alcohol and I have 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.340
 I'm going to show you some napkins I already 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.670
 I have cut but use the napkins 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.750
 classic paper I chose the reason that I 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.610
 I liked what I cut out and I'm going to work and 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.709
 I'm going to make the decoupage napkins 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.380
 of paper usually come with two 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.070
 white paper films that should be 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.739
 discard these two I discard them a 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.450
 time I cut the figure discarded and 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.480
 I have the design to work 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.250
 I have here the product next to me 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 flexible varnish that is the one that I'm going to 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.880
 use to make the decoupage with the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.720
 napkin 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.580
 I 'm going to load, I 'm going to gather in the sector 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.580
 of the dish notice what I'm going to do 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.569
 an excessive load let's say I do not measure a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.650
 place 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.810
 just nor is it signposted where the design 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.689
 going to go call me total charge 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.319
 only what I intend is to adhere 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.389
 napkin that perfectly and once 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.810
 dry I will seal it with shellac 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.940
 colorless this product 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.970
 will allow me the one I'm using in 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.630
 this time the decoupage is to adhere 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.630
 Napkin 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.510
 perfectly fine look at me only 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.770
 I put the flexible varnish with a brush 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 I am ensuring that it is achieved 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.790
 perfectly adherence 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.870
 I assure soft I'm not a brush I 'm very 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.100
 strong maybe for some sector I 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.060
 missing product that did not adhere levanto 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.060
 position 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.600
 I insist with the product and with the brush 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:55.240
 that is dry helped me to adhere 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.610
 what this product has that if not 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.680
 adhered well I can raise the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.440
 napkin and correct the location of 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.860
 of the design in this case is a bouquet 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.580
 of roses with their respective leaves and 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.580
 buds 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.370
 a very simple reason very easy to 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.079
 do 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.410
 once this is ready I'm going to 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.389
 brush over it has to be dry 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.220
 I'm going to do it fresh now but 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.970
 I'm going to paint with the same varnish 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.390
 decoupage to protect and make sure that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.580
 the entire napkin was adhered 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.760
 once this step is ready and well 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.390
 dry just there I can start using 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.330
 the lacquer gum colorless the gum which in 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.640
 color to take a drying time is 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:57.390
 It is preferable to give it a little time to dry 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.940
 perfectly one hour two hours and 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.430
 re-apply a second layer me in 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.770
 this case I will leave this side and I will 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.220
 move to one that I have already more advanced 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:12.110
 where this space is dry is where 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.110
 I'm going to apply the colorless lacquer 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.670
 For the shellac I need a brush 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.940
 I have here the cargo product 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:26.020
 I'm discharging and I'm just going to paint 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:30.390
 look where is the napkin of this 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.280
 way I'm waterproofing 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:37.310
 protecting 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:41.600
 this decoupage to then be able to wash it 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.580
 It can be washed perfectly normally 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.190
 how do we wash any dishes 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.980
 I have not tried as I ask normal in 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.340
 dishwasher but it tolerates perfectly 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.950
 washing and it's mostly decorative 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.980
 notice that what I am using is in 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.490
 I did not use the ends of the slab in the 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.130
 center because if I used it in the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.310
 I can get to hurt him when 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.220
 we have to use knives or covers 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.940
 you like fast ones and 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.280
 how fast fast is very nice work 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.240

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.260
 that the base is white in this case the 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.570
 long in this case it reserves perfect 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.930
 lovely blue with white living a 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.810

 of tea in this case I proposed the dishes 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.030
 I found it more prettier to 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.250
 longing source for oven can be put 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.910

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.080
 book money but it would be good good
