next thing you want to do is you like to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.890 
next thing you want to do is you like to
fold<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:26.420> in<00:00:26.539> half<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.589> can<00:00:27.769> start<00:00:28.099> cutting

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
fold it in half so you can start cutting

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.599 
fold it in half so you can start cutting
I've<00:00:29.900> just<00:00:30.140> laid<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:30.500> out<00:00:30.589> flat<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.220> directly

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.600 
in half and now I'm going to cut it and
hopefully<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:34.940> work<00:00:35.300> out<00:00:35.920> cut<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.070> out

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610

hopefully it work out cut this out
that's<00:00:37.910> probably<00:00:38.120> an<00:00:38.330> easier<00:00:38.720> way<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:38.900> do<00:00:39.230> this

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
