the<00:02:29.770> standard<00:02:30.460> for<00:02:31.090> audio<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.750> why<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.410> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
the standard for audio so why is that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.710 
the standard for audio so why is that
still<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.100> pervasive<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.030> compressed

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
still so pervasive well it's compressed

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
still so pervasive well it's compressed
audio<00:02:34.870> format<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:35.710> cheap<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.190> free<00:02:36.640> it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
audio format it's cheap it's free it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.580 
audio format it's cheap it's free it's
easy<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.720> convenient<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.200> can<00:02:38.260> move<00:02:38.470> them

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
easy it's convenient you can move them

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.470 
easy it's convenient you can move them
around<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.430> got<00:02:39.580> its<00:02:39.700> advantages<00:02:39.910> but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480

enjoy<00:02:42.490> really<00:02:42.820> enjoying<00:02:43.180> music<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:43.750> not<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
enjoy really enjoying music it's not a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.510 
enjoy really enjoying music it's not a
good<00:02:44.440> format<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.800> doesn't<00:02:45.040> sound<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.250> good

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
good format it doesn't sound that good

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.890 
good format it doesn't sound that good
right<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.540> have<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.660> theory

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
right now you have it you have a theory

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.630 
right now you have it you have a theory
that<00:02:46.990> CDs<00:02:47.380> are<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:47.740> away<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.160> think<00:02:48.520> they'll

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
that CDs are going away I think they'll

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.270 
that CDs are going away I think they'll
go<00:02:48.760> what's<00:02:49.030> next<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.900> files<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.010> know<00:02:51.100> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
go what's next up files you know a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.890 
go what's next up files you know a
better<00:02:51.790> quality<00:02:52.060> files<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.540> everybody's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
better quality files because everybody's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.270 
better quality files because everybody's
got<00:02:53.020> broadband<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.100> have<00:02:54.160> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
got broadband now so you don't have to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.710 
got broadband now so you don't have to
have<00:02:54.370> compression<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.300> once<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.570> can

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
have compression so once you can

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.750 
have compression so once you can
download<00:02:55.900> better<00:02:56.740> than<00:02:56.920> CD<00:02:57.160> quality<00:02:57.340> once<00:02:57.670> you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
download better than CD quality once you

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.450 
download better than CD quality once you
can<00:02:57.880> download<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:58.300> 192k<00:02:59.260> 24-bit<00:03:00.070> files

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
can download like 192k 24-bit files

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.280 
can download like 192k 24-bit files
you'll<00:03:01.240> have<00:03:01.420> good<00:03:01.630> sound<00:03:01.960> you'll<00:03:02.140> have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
you'll have good sound you'll have

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.020 
you'll have good sound you'll have
convenience<00:03:02.830> they'll<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.490> accessibility

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
convenience they'll have accessibility

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.820 
convenience they'll have accessibility
and<00:03:04.360> even<00:03:04.840> an<00:03:04.960> audiophile<00:03:05.410> like<00:03:05.560> me<00:03:05.680> will

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
and even an audiophile like me will

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.590 
and even an audiophile like me will
probably<00:03:06.340> be<00:03:06.490> happy<00:03:06.700> not<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.180> happy<00:03:07.390> as

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
probably be happy not as happy as

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.330 
probably be happy not as happy as
playing<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.960> record<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:08.410> I'll<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.740> happy<00:03:08.860> do

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
playing a record but I'll be happy do

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.650 
playing a record but I'll be happy do
you<00:03:09.430> think<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.670> technology<00:03:09.970> will<00:03:10.300> come<00:03:10.480> about

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
you think the technology will come about

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690 
you think the technology will come about
but<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.050> can<00:03:11.200> actually<00:03:11.320> record<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:12.100> digital

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
but they can actually record a digital

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.310 
but they can actually record a digital
file<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.090> way<00:03:13.210> you<00:03:13.270> record<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.720> vinyl<00:03:14.020> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
file the way you record a vinyl and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.290 
file the way you record a vinyl and
sound<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.830> good<00:03:14.950> yeah<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.460> don't<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:15.970> you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
sound is good yeah I don't know I you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.000 
sound is good yeah I don't know I you
know<00:03:16.420> 192<00:03:17.020> 24<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.410> bit<00:03:17.530> should<00:03:17.650> have<00:03:17.770> done<00:03:17.860> it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
know 192 24 a bit should have done it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.410 
know 192 24 a bit should have done it
but<00:03:18.430> there's<00:03:18.640> still<00:03:18.700> something<00:03:19.030> about
