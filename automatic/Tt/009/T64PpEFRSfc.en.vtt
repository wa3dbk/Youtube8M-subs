the side firebox you could probably use

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.670 
the side firebox you could probably use
Webber<00:05:25.860> just<00:05:25.979> throw<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:27.140> coals<00:05:28.140> on<00:05:28.320> one<00:05:28.469> side

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
Webber just throw the coals on one side

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.020

the<00:05:32.069> oven<00:05:32.309> you<00:05:32.400> could<00:05:32.490> probably<00:05:32.610> throw<00:05:32.849> them

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:32.999 
the oven you could probably throw them

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.839 
the oven you could probably throw them
in<00:05:33.059> an<00:05:33.180> oven<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.809> about<00:05:33.839> 325<00:05:34.710> for<00:05:35.129> about<00:05:35.189> 25-30

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
in an oven at about 325 for about 25-30

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.329 
in an oven at about 325 for about 25-30
minutes<00:05:36.270> just<00:05:37.110> check<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.559> temperature<00:05:38.249> and

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:38.339 
minutes just check the temperature and

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.230 
minutes just check the temperature and
make<00:05:38.490> sure<00:05:38.610> they're<00:05:38.699> cooked<00:05:38.909> all<00:05:39.119> the<00:05:39.210> way
