00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.130
 hi to all and nano I hope this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.509
 performance relies on a video a whole 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.920
 little bit different compared to 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.450
 usually we are not sure was 15 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.420
 years is not about the career either 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 we will talk a little bit about news 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.660
 football in all that is true 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.090
 life and then after we will make a transition 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.320
 compared to fifa 16 we will speak a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.970
 few transfers the transfer window 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.619
 approach I still have the league final 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.660
 champions to live who will arrive 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.059
 very very quickly and then after that it'll be 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 the fire of the transfer window all the month of June 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.370
 July August and until August 31 we will be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 most certainly on the alert in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 terms of transfers 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 the first transfer you see it at 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.910
 the screen knows we speak for a few 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 days I always put the source in the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.469
 description to avoid talking a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.820
 little bit of everything and anything in 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.110
 put some articles 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.120
 even if sometimes it's not always and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.489
 the first cd on karim benzema makes the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.680
 dance a little bit to manchester united 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 for a sum of sent in the 57 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 million euros its 56 and the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 dust then is that it's 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 yes that is possible, it can be 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 interesting 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.159
 yes will it be done 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.930
 naturally German footage will not be 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.460
 again we will see sacred in discussion 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.840
 so why is it possible 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.790
 just because manchester is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.619
 native looking scorers and even 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.939
 an attacker because benzema is also 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 doctor or six best attackers 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.869
 that is to say, he can make score 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.159
 better mark that can be interesting 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.290
 because the madrid real is very 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 very interested for the guard david of 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 gea which is a very very good at 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.479
 manchester and especially iker casillas who 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.560
 refueling since the bullet and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.060
 is old you have to renew a little 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 little in the tasks at madrid real 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 manchester and he is also interested in 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 gareth bale is there going to be a 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.909
 transaction between manchester and the real 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 from madrid 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.079
 I think it's 100% sure that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 discussions it's going to be done in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.509
 waiting a little bit why I think 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.130
 that there will be a little renewal 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 real madrid yann departure from carlo 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.710
 Ancelotti 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
 the arrival of rafa benitez who is a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.640
 coach a little bit for me 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.549
 mixed that is to say that he went through 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.869
 liverpool that was pretty enough 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.549
 mixed here it is in naples 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.049
 that's mixed also especially since he has a 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.220
 very good staff in support that the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.860
 Italian championship but it's more than 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.020
 it's apart from juve and roma pu see 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 he had not a little bit a little bit 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.869
 short way it's not a great coach is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.870
 usually km uh 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.920
 it may be the right time for 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.950
 go 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 I put you the new stats 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.880
 on fifa 16 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.680
 you have karim benzema card 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.110
 united manchester version with a 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.489
 several to 86 so he was a little 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.350
 little dropped me who did that you me 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.170
 say you think about it in the clips the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.000
 second the second best it would be 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.010
 khedira beaurevoir the juventus him it is 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.750
 almost sure he's going through 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.239
 at the time played by the medical visit 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.799
 I put him a general note so much 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.360
 report had college is degressive that's to 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.620
 to say that I believe he is at 84 I the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 goes on to 82 you have the stadiums that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.810
 appears on the screen 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.790
 why he just has 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.739
 not played this year at the real de madrid a 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.060
 made only 16 matches it is offered 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.980
 a salary of 4 million net 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.750
 why the juventus there is no bac 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.609
 may be leaving for a very 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.560
 loud sum we talk about him in match and 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.120
 steria and he talks about him at the barÃ§a on 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.890
 announce a little bit everywhere we'll see 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.380
 will definitely be the soap opera of this 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.000
 summer pirlo is still very very strong 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.180
 but a guy aging him so we're going 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.799
 end up with mediums to axis to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.109
 renew so khedira who puts there 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.850
 always marchisio pirlo who will be 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.109
 still there I think but with a whole 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.489
 little bit of play time it's 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.260
 normal it is necessary to prepare after pirlo 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.000
 is for bat we do not know what he's going 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
 to do but in any case he is he is 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.579
 very coveted 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.720
 the third player we go back to 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.430
 manchester united who will be very 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.829
 certainly as was not it's a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.780
 great actor of this summer mercato with 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.910
 dani alves so why is he in 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.049
 conflict with Barca was again 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.510
 you have links in the description 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.030
 of all that I tell you that risk 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.950
 to be easy enough for him to find 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.390
 a club is a safe bet in a big way 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.440
 right defender he is fast and 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.760
 aggressive 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.650
 it doubles a lot with the minots 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.660
 right when when they can it's 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.280
 still someone who kills what is 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.340
 sure that with a sure value at his age he 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 32 years ago and were but why not I 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.650
 think he will have no trouble finding a 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.050
 club manchester she and who him 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.320
 does not fit well I think there is 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.730
 raphael there in defense and in law 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.200
 who is also Brazilian who is a small 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.880
 little young people who find regular sometimes 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.660
 too hurt so that can make the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.540
 compensation between raphael and dani alves 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.860
 in terms of age and experience then 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.570
 a salary roughly sent into the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.850
 four quarters of 5 million net 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.570
 it can be interesting and there is 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.030
 also galatasaray the wesley team 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.530
 sneijder what's on so we'll see the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.850
 friends what are you going to give you say in 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.290
 comments what do you think 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.290
 and we'll meet again very soon to 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.780
 episode 2 2 we talk about news about fifa 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.010
 and see the door is lapped the friends I 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.490
 tell you very quickly especially stay cool 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.490
 that is the most important
