00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 without a doubt when we talk about 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.109
 video game sagas of the shooter genre 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 metal slug occupies a great position is not 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 for nothing the arrival of this game at 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.799
 recreational and little machines was a moment 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.870
 epic for millions this shooter left in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 background to other games of the same 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 category for example the saga of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 nintendo against whom despite being a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.760
 great game for retro gamers when 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 metal slug appeared this saga finished 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.630
 being another game that was forgotten 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.710
 as if they had given a push to a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.660
 precipice 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 this game was very advanced for its 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280
 era their graphics were great both 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
 in the enemies characters and backgrounds 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.629
 where formerly point the funds only 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.000
 they made black background their music was 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.800
 extraordinary the truth I'm sure 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.020
 that we all remember the song of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 first level fights with bosses and the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 song of the final mission and its 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260
 game mode was perhaps was the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 that he did number one in games of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.059
 the company snk without a doubt was a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.789
 epic game and not to mention their 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.609
 continuations as metal slug 2x and 3 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.290
 that they were much much much more than 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.570
 that most expected from the game 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.850
 titles you played you will know that when 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.370
 they took out a new game of this saga 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.260
 they did not walk with little things this game 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.570
 was for many a large part of their 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.910
 childhood gamer for others was a game 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 of the golden age of snk and for others 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.440
 this game was a unique game that never 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.170
 can never be created to perfection 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.479
 for another video game company and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.070
 let me tell you that that was true at 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.380
 same as many companies of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
 video games the company snk had a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.550
 period of time in which he had 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.050
 big problems among these had a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.030
 big problem that left them in the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.399
 bankruptcy leaving in very bad state to 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 the company this problem affected their 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.660
 programmers and way to their 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 games and a great example was the metal 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.009
 slug 4 the fourth game of this installment 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 that was the opposite of what the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.869
 most expected from this that problems 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.729
 had first of all this game was not 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.830
 created by the same group that created the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 first three titles this game was 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.479
 created by a group called mega a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.670
 video game company not very well known 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.649
 which was responsible for creating the 4 game 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.170
 of this saga which shows that it was very 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.360
 loose in many ways between these the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.170
 characters even though in this game 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.150
 they added 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
 new characters called Maria and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.170
 trevor were not the great both 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.819
 characters do not have so much history and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.890
 besides the character no one is 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.170
 practically the characters cold without 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.380
 glasses and cap red hair and with some 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 few animations of the blonde character 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.530
 and not to mention trevor which is the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.230
 Tarma character with colors 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.420
 changed and with a different voice the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 game does not have different weapons so 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 say the game has a new weapon the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.989
 which is not the great thing at first glance 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 they are two machine guns but when you use them 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.610
 notes that are not the great thing the truth 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.989
 this weapon is a waste of time both 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.090
 for the one who uses it as for 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.069
 creators to create it since this weapon 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.019
 it's practically the normal machine gun 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.000
 of the game but a little more shit because 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.769
 this submachine gun can only fire in 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.989
 four directions when the submachine gun 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.330
 normal triggers in eight directions the 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.700
 weapon does not have more bullet capacity 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.549
 has more strength faster and nothing for 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.980
 the style the enemies of the game are not 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.569
 great thing the truth many enemies of 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.970
 game are the same as games 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.190
 previous for example the vans 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.280
 missile launchers that appeared in the first 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.130
 mission of light metals 3 the gt also 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.380
 3 among many other enemies besides 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.150
 as if this were not enough the creators 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.250
 of the game they had so much laziness in 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.780
 create new enemies that even up 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.850
 they only changed the colors and 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.010
 they added only one or two animations to 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.989
 these for example the blue soldiers and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.940
 scientists from the last mission and not 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.980
 they just did this with normal bosses 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.959
 but with heads of level for example the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.910
 final boss that is a tower and when 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.130
 you get to the final part of this you can 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.290
 note that he is a final boss created with the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.020
 union of other chiefs such as the chief 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.970
 metal slug x2 and also with the very 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.340
 famous enemy someone as extra 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.019
 talking about 'the in this character of 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.209
 way he would have appeared in the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.610
 video game and they added it with a small 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.239
 detail this is a robot but now it's 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.010
 much much easier because they remember 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.100
 that when you got close to him you 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.870
 attacked with his knife and killed you 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.519
 now it's the opposite when you 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.950
 you put near him and he attacks you with the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.970
 knife you do not die but rather pushes you 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.340
 but without killing you 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.470
 in a few words you could wear the most 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.720
 close as possible to this and nothing will happen 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.070
 many of the game's scenarios are 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
 of the other games 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.340
 for example the mission of the zombies 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.650
 has the city stage 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.170
 destroyed that appeared in metal slug one 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.360
 only that they changed the colors this 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.550
 the vehicles did it many times 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.620
 of the game are not the great thing some 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.420
 Game vehicles are just enemies 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.490
 but with the added sub-machine gun 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.460
 tank and with small details added 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.680
 nothing new that has not been seen before 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.660
 game has many things that despite 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.250
 being new are really the same as 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.560
 other games but changed 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.600
 an example the blue helicopter of the game 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.050
 which is really the helicopter 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.060
 final boss of the original game the music 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.890
 of the game is original but the themes more 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.570
 famous of the game as the attack 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.670
 final or the subject of the level bosses 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.530
 were replaced by themes that despite 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.600
 of being good are not enough 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.790
 good to compare them 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.100
 originals this game has many 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.840
 a lot of bad data showing that the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.850
 mega company had nothing of 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.980
 originality and experience in creating 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.990
 video games especially when we talk 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.080
 of a large work of videogames 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.420
 as it is metal slug without a doubt 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.130
 light metals 4 was the loosest subject of 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.000
 a saga of video game that you 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.340
 I considered 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.470
