and I suppose in one essence is a very

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.150 
and I suppose in one essence is a very
humble<00:02:21.250> man<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.060> another<00:02:22.470> aspect<00:02:23.470> you

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160

humble man and in another aspect you
would<00:02:24.310> say<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.940> his<00:02:25.150> work<00:02:25.450> speaks<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.380> all

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
would say that his work speaks to all

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.300 
would say that his work speaks to all
denominations<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.940> all<00:02:28.060> types<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.690> people<00:02:29.310> it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
denominations to all types of people it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.900 
denominations to all types of people it
has<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> childlike<00:02:31.150> innocence<00:02:31.630> yet<00:02:32.020> attitude

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
has a childlike innocence yet attitude

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.280 
has a childlike innocence yet attitude
encompasses<00:02:33.910> passion<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.870> poetry<00:02:35.850> emotion

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
encompasses passion and poetry emotion

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.840 
encompasses passion and poetry emotion
and<00:02:38.290> very<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:40.060> sort<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.450> screams<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.620> love

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and very it's sort of screams for love

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.130 
and very it's sort of screams for love
and<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.240> Blackman<00:02:43.780> has<00:02:43.870> always

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and I think that Blackman has always

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.100 
and I think that Blackman has always
sought

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
imagery through shape and form to what

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.509 
imagery through shape and form to what
we<00:03:49.840> understand<00:03:50.320> as<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.530> Blackman<00:03:50.950> painting<00:03:51.310> it

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
we understand as a Blackman painting it

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.430 
we understand as a Blackman painting it
is<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.880> essence<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.420> his<00:03:52.570> being<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.140> he<00:03:53.290> was

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
is the essence of his being and he was

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.110 
is the essence of his being and he was
able<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.799> transform<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.730> through

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
able to transform that through

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.050 
able to transform that through
figurative<00:03:55.750> work<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> think<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.880> a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
figurative work so I think that is a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.410 
figurative work so I think that is a
landmark<00:03:58.810> achievement<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.310> Australia<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420
