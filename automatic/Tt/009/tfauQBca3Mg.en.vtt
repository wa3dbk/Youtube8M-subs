 was a kind of path 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.880

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 Ram 2005 dinners battery 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 the android 4 point on a screen your hd and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:40.860
 ps2 white plastic back display 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.110
 the custom home screen to achieve 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 is android 4.1 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.570
 but it is customized by bg everything much 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 simple to take the application from here 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.409
 Eliandra Gavetinha put it back there 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.409

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.409
 multitasking click here has been canceled 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.630
 it is showing here his box I 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.970
 I really liked this device the functions 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.660
 they are very easy well until there is a lot 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 camera and the front and 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.550
 rear and front so good do not 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.610
 has professional camera resolution but 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.430
 It's a camera bag in his box. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:52.050
 I came here with the messy manual here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050
 usb charger 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:09.840
 I find it very cool 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:09.840
 the extra glossy sheels 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.150
 curricular 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:21.090
 if I'm not mistaken and the key to the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.670
 key chip compartment crashed here 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.360
 In this key, here you go back to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.360
 open the compartment 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 because that's it there was a boxing in great day 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.730
 a device that I really enjoy 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 I hope you liked it and I 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.320
 I recommend it then, bye, bye
