the game I think this gun is absolutely
beast<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:38.489> fun<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> use<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.200> every

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600 
beast it's so much fun to use and every
single<00:00:40.379> time<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> gun<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> seem<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> be

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
single time I use this gun I seem to be

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
single time I use this gun I seem to be
doing<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:42.149> well<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
doing pretty well so I actually go on I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
doing pretty well so I actually go on I
believe<00:00:43.949> like<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.249> 26<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:44.999> 27<00:00:45.239> gun<00:00:45.629> streak<00:00:45.839> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
believe like a 26 or 27 gun streak to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.689 
believe like a 26 or 27 gun streak to
start<00:00:46.199> off<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> game<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.429> end<00:00:47.609> up

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
start off the game and then I end up

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.610 
start off the game and then I end up
going<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.179> nuclear<00:00:48.480> streak<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.109> I<00:00:49.199> drop<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
going on a nuclear streak and I drop a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
going on a nuclear streak and I drop a
36<00:00:50.550> kill<00:00:50.760> streak<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.089> 36<00:00:51.480> gun<00:00:51.629> streak<00:00:51.839> however

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

the UAV the lightning strike and then

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.419 
the UAV the lightning strike and then

overall I am using rejects so that's a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880 
overall I am using rejects so that's a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
little bit of a downside but III wanted

dissection<00:01:40.080> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.230> class<00:01:40.440> setup<00:01:40.800> and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
dissection on the class setup and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.130 
dissection on the class setup and
everything<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.000> nature<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> said

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
everything of that nature so like I said

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
everything of that nature so like I said
using<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.650> BRM<00:01:44.190> LMG<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.700> actually<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> first

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
using the BRM LMG is actually the first

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.940 
using the BRM LMG is actually the first
LMG<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.080> unlock<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> believe

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
LMG that you unlock and I believe

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.500 
LMG that you unlock and I believe
there's<00:01:47.100> even<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.460> default<00:01:47.910> class<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.420> on

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
there's even a default class with it on

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.330 
there's even a default class with it on
so<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.230> you're<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.650> hopping<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.160> beta

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so if you're just hopping into the beta

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
so if you're just hopping into the beta
say<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> were<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.300> waiting<00:01:51.480> for<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> come

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
say you were just waiting for it to come

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
say you were just waiting for it to come

this gameplay I was rocking three

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.099 
this gameplay I was rocking three
attachments<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> had<00:02:39.329> primary<00:02:39.810> gunfighter

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
attachments so I had primary gunfighter

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:40.940 
attachments so I had primary gunfighter
on<00:02:40.560> there

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
on there

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.369 
on there
I<00:02:40.980> had<00:02:41.489> stock<00:02:42.329> because<00:02:42.659> stock<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.019> really<00:02:43.230> feel

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
I had stock because stock I really feel

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.559 
I had stock because stock I really feel
like<00:02:43.469> is<00:02:43.620> noticeable<00:02:44.069> more<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.430> LMGs<00:02:44.969> on<00:02:45.120> ARS<00:02:45.510> I

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
like is noticeable more on LMGs on ARS I

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.059 
like is noticeable more on LMGs on ARS I
feel<00:02:45.719> like<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.959> completely<00:02:46.079> useless<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.980> on

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
feel like it's completely useless but on

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.770 
feel like it's completely useless but on
LMGs<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:48.209> seems<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.480> little<00:02:48.540> bit<00:02:48.719> more

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
LMGs it seems a little bit more

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.729 
LMGs it seems a little bit more
noticeable<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.439> you<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.650> definitely

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
noticeable so you can definitely

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.319 
noticeable so you can definitely
strengthen<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.340> deist<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.879> bit<00:02:51.000> faster

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
strengthen a deist a little bit faster

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.849 
strengthen a deist a little bit faster
with<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.780> then<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.930> also<00:02:52.049> have<00:02:52.319> fast<00:02:52.620> mag

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
reload speed down a little bit so I can

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.649 
reload speed down a little bit so I can

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
reload on the go a little bit quicker

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.300
