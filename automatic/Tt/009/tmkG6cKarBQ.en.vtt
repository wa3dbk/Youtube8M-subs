00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.280 
personal preference but what I like to
run<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.250> lot<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.550> times<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:49.030> non-lethal<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.050> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
run a lot of times is non-lethal so the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
run a lot of times is non-lethal so the
UAV<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:51.010> system<00:02:51.370> hack<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.880> UAV<00:02:52.240> I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
UAV and the system hack and on the UAV I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.630 
UAV and the system hack and on the UAV I
use<00:02:52.810> threat<00:02:53.110> detection<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.680> speed<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.490> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
use threat detection and speed this is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.550 
use threat detection and speed this is
pretty<00:02:54.820> much<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.240> best<00:02:55.420> combo<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> use<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
pretty much the best combo to use on the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.140 
pretty much the best combo to use on the
UAV<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.220> you're<00:02:57.400> allowed<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.700> see<00:02:57.880> people

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
UAV because you're allowed to see people

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150 
UAV because you're allowed to see people
through<00:02:58.330> walls<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.780> also<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.530> used<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.890> speed

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
through walls and also if used to speed

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.430 
through walls and also if used to speed
module<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:01.000> makes<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.450> lot<00:03:01.600> faster<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.170> run

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
module it makes it a lot faster and run

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.260 
module it makes it a lot faster and run
a<00:03:02.470> system<00:03:02.830> hack<00:03:02.980> all<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.550> use<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.760> disable

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
a system hack all I use is disable

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.330 
a system hack all I use is disable
exosuits<00:03:04.840> people<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.709> know<00:03:05.890> how<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.070> play

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
exosuits people do not know how to play

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.190 
exosuits people do not know how to play
advanced<00:03:06.700> warfare<00:03:06.880> it's<00:03:07.270> not<00:03:07.510> double<00:03:07.900> jumping

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
advanced warfare it's not double jumping

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.170 
advanced warfare it's not double jumping
and<00:03:08.380> dashing<00:03:08.890> all<00:03:09.100> over<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.400> place<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and dashing all over the place so the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.910 
and dashing all over the place so the
disable<00:03:10.600> exosuits<00:03:11.140> definitely<00:03:11.620> gives<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
disable exosuits definitely gives you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.740 
disable exosuits definitely gives you
the<00:03:12.040> advantage<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.640> enemy<00:03:12.910> if<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.450> don't

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the advantage on the enemy if you don't

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.060 
the advantage on the enemy if you don't
want<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.020> use<00:03:14.140> non-lethal<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.860> want<00:03:15.010> to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
want to use non-lethal and you want to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.320 
want to use non-lethal and you want to
use<00:03:15.220> lethal<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:15.760> go<00:03:15.850> ahead<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.120> throw<00:03:16.209> on

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
use lethal then go ahead and throw on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.880 
use lethal then go ahead and throw on
