the plan is to do it all so this is just
windows<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.180> down<00:02:49.330> here<00:02:49.570> by<00:02:49.840> carlson

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.470 

also<00:02:55.140> throughout<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.800> city<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> Sun

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
also throughout the city of the Sun

also throughout the city of the Sun
cool

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.470 

Liza<00:03:06.030> production<00:03:07.030> tools

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.660 

and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> consider<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.250> Sun<00:03:11.459> can

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and then when you consider the Sun can

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.520 
and then when you consider the Sun can
you<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> commanding<00:03:13.470> control

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you so this is a commanding control

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.610 
you so this is a commanding control
actually<00:03:14.370> maybe<00:03:15.239> let's<00:03:15.540> turn<00:03:15.750> around<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.500> we

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
actually maybe let's turn around so we

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.710 
actually maybe let's turn around so we
can<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:17.580> get<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.239> shade<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.629> a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
can get get it in the shade here a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
can get get it in the shade here a
little<00:03:18.840> bit<00:03:19.019> maybe<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.319> can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.769> better<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
little bit maybe we can see it better so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.710 
little bit maybe we can see it better so
that's<00:03:22.110> your<00:03:22.670> key<00:03:23.670> productivity<00:03:24.239> tool<00:03:24.450> side

that's your key productivity tool side

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.050 
that's your key productivity tool side
of<00:03:24.840> things<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.830> then<00:03:25.980> down<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.280> bottom<00:03:26.580> we've

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
of things and then down the bottom we've

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.280 
of things and then down the bottom we've
also<00:03:27.209> got<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.540> monitor<00:03:31.019> screen

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
also got you see for monitor screen

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.720 
also got you see for monitor screen
tells<00:03:31.860> mean<00:03:32.099> what<00:03:32.780> operators<00:03:33.780> are<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.730> little

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
real real time tracking is on so we can

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.069 
real real time tracking is on so we can
see<00:03:37.920> where<00:03:38.790> where<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.420> grater<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.900> dozer

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
see where where the grater and the dozer

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.550 
see where where the grater and the dozer
is<00:03:40.940> if<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.030> get<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.510> we<00:03:43.349> can<00:03:43.470> go

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
is if we get out of that we can go

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.059 
is if we get out of that we can go
direct<00:03:43.890> into<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:45.450> dozer<00:03:45.690> those<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.769> currently

direct into the dozer those is currently
on<00:03:47.190> push<00:03:47.400> we'll<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.819> rotate<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.359> for<00:03:48.569> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
on push we'll just rotate it for a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.660 
on push we'll just rotate it for a
better<00:03:49.109> screen

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.649

iPhones<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.840> small<00:04:15.109> device<00:04:15.609> so<00:04:16.609> that's<00:04:16.789> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
iPhones the small device so that's the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.370 
iPhones the small device so that's the
top<00:04:17.120> view

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.620
