00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
mentally you drained but the confidence

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.020 
mentally you drained but the confidence
somehow<00:01:27.350> gets<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:27.979> through<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.790> when<00:01:28.939> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
somehow gets you through and when you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.850 
somehow gets you through and when you
don't<00:01:29.180> have<00:01:29.299> confidence<00:01:29.570> that's<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:30.740> when

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
don't have confidence that's then when

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.719 
don't have confidence that's then when
you<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:32.619> sort<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.740> trust<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.549> hard

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
them in the beginning is honestly quite

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
them in the beginning is honestly quite

the<00:02:55.530> older<00:02:55.890> guy<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.910> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> look<00:02:57.300> up<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the older guy they kind of look up to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.660 
the older guy they kind of look up to
you<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.050> quite<00:02:58.350> they<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> they<00:02:59.490> want

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you but not quite they but and they want

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.490 
you but not quite they but and they want
to<00:02:59.760> beat<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.480> I'm<00:03:00.600> not<00:03:00.690> ten<00:03:01.290> years

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
to beat you because I'm not ten years

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.080 
to beat you because I'm not ten years
apart<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:02.100> their<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.459> sort<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.700> only<00:03:02.819> five

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
apart with their but sort of only five

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.510 
apart with their but sort of only five
or<00:03:03.270> six<00:03:03.380> but<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> new<00:03:05.040> generation

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
or six but it is like a new generation

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.729 
or six but it is like a new generation
and<00:03:06.180> that's<00:03:06.300> mentally<00:03:07.110> for<00:03:07.290> me<00:03:07.380> was<00:03:07.530> quite<00:03:07.709> a

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and that's mentally for me was quite a

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.380 
and that's mentally for me was quite a
challenge<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.280> getting<00:03:08.520> over<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.150> hurdle

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
challenge just getting over that hurdle

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.199 
challenge just getting over that hurdle
and<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.650> think<00:03:11.010> Rafa<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.850> matter<00:03:12.030> because

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and I think Rafa for that matter because

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.440 
and I think Rafa for that matter because
of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> way<00:03:12.780> he<00:03:12.930> plays<00:03:13.170> with<00:03:13.380> his<00:03:13.440> left-handed

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
of the way he plays with his left-handed

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.180 
of the way he plays with his left-handed
topspin<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.750> forth<00:03:16.019> he<00:03:16.140> has<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.590> maybe

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
topspin and so forth he has really maybe

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.030 
topspin and so forth he has really maybe
you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.850> think<00:03:18.570> through<00:03:19.320> my<00:03:19.350> game<00:03:19.680> again

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
you know think through my game again

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.600 
you know think through my game again
what<00:03:20.610> do<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.820> need<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.090> change<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.690> actually

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
what do I need to change to actually

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.370 
what do I need to change to actually
compete<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.850> beat<00:03:24.060> him<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.480> he's<00:03:25.080> been<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
compete and beat him and he's been the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.610 
compete and beat him and he's been the
most<00:03:25.530> challenging<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:26.160> me<00:03:26.310> probably<00:03:26.700> overall

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
most challenging for me probably overall

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.509 
most challenging for me probably overall
combined<00:03:28.620> was<00:03:28.769> late<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.220> at<00:03:29.340> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
combined was late and you at the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.309 
combined was late and you at the
beginning<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.880> my<00:03:30.060> career<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.630> play<00:03:30.780> against<00:03:31.140> I

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
beginning of my career to play against I

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.930 
beginning of my career to play against I
read<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.739> really<00:03:32.010> interesting<00:03:32.130> article<00:03:32.640> I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
read this really interesting article I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.400 
read this really interesting article I
think<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.300> was<00:03:33.480> called<00:03:33.660> Federer<00:03:34.080> as<00:03:34.380> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
think it was called Federer as a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.680 
think it was called Federer as a
religious<00:03:34.980> experience<00:03:35.370> mm-hmm<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.569> was

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
religious experience mm-hmm it was

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.660 
religious experience mm-hmm it was
written<00:03:36.840> by<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.140> novelist<00:03:37.800> David<00:03:38.280> Foster

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
written by the novelist David Foster

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.050 
written by the novelist David Foster
Wallace<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.330> for<00:03:39.360> me<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.140> think<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:41.060> actually

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
Wallace and for me I think I actually

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.840 
Wallace and for me I think I actually
felt<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.840> when<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.769> was<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.920> 2007<00:03:44.730> Wimbledon

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
felt that when it was a 2007 Wimbledon

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.410 
felt that when it was a 2007 Wimbledon
final<00:03:45.450> between<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.250> doll<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.209> that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
final between you and a doll and that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.250 
final between you and a doll and that
game<00:03:48.780> was<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:50.400> could<00:03:50.579> see<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:51.090> two<00:03:51.390> very

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
part of it and I think I think it was

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.690 
part of it and I think I think it was
actually<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.630> 2008<00:04:25.229> finals<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.950> seven<00:04:26.550> we

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
actually the 2008 finals in seven we

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.550 
actually the 2008 finals in seven we
played<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> best<00:04:27.210> five<00:04:27.750> setter<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.229> well<00:04:28.410> and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
played the best five setter as well and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.790 
played the best five setter as well and
in<00:04:28.710> 2008<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.310> lost<00:04:29.640> our<00:04:29.789> epic<00:04:30.350> 97<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.410> think<00:04:31.650> in

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
in 2008 I lost our epic 97 I think in

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.040 
in 2008 I lost our epic 97 I think in
the<00:04:31.979> fifth<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:33.210> think<00:04:33.570> that's<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.900> matter

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the fifth and I think that's the matter

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.900 
the fifth and I think that's the matter
that<00:04:34.350> everybody<00:04:34.919> sort<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.160> still<00:04:35.490> talks<00:04:35.729> about

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
that everybody sort of still talks about

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.580 
that everybody sort of still talks about
as<00:04:36.600> being<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.380> greatest

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
as being that one of the greatest

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.680 
as being that one of the greatest
matches<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.160> all<00:04:38.310> time<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:39.600> just

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
matches of all time and it's just

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360 
matches of all time and it's just
special<00:04:40.350> being<00:04:40.560> part<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:41.100> then<00:04:41.250> you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
special being part of that then you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.100 
special being part of that then you
start<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.820> feel<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.090> once<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.720> enter<00:04:43.080> like

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
start to feel that once you enter like

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.950 
start to feel that once you enter like
an<00:04:43.560> epic<00:04:43.830> fourth<00:04:44.280> or<00:04:44.490> fifth<00:04:44.729> set<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.300> you

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
an epic fourth or fifth set and you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.950 
an epic fourth or fifth set and you
realise<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.380> sort<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.760> world<00:04:48.000> has<00:04:48.330> you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
realise that sort of the world has you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.870 
realise that sort of the world has you
know<00:04:49.050> standing<00:04:49.650> still<00:04:49.860> around<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.370> and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
everybody's now just maybe glued to the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.779 
everybody's now just maybe glued to the
TV<00:04:52.560> even<00:04:52.950> though<00:04:53.039> people<00:04:53.340> are<00:04:53.430> doing<00:04:53.669> their

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
TV even though people are doing their

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.890 
TV even though people are doing their
own<00:04:53.820> thing<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.659> others

own thing on the others

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.740 
own thing on the others
the<00:04:55.110> planet<00:04:55.500> or<00:04:55.650> elsewhere<00:04:56.100> but<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.210> felt<00:04:57.540> like

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
the planet or elsewhere but it felt like

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.900 
the planet or elsewhere but it felt like
that<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.320> maybe<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.430> match<00:04:59.580> should<00:04:59.790> have

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
that and maybe the match should have

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.400 
that and maybe the match should have
been<00:05:00.030> in<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:00.300> interrupted<00:05:00.930> at<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.139> end<00:05:01.290> of

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.029 
happened you know Rafa the way he wanted
was<00:05:11.460> unbelievable<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.330> for<00:05:13.020> me<00:05:13.110> was<00:05:13.289> cool

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
was unbelievable but for me was cool

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.710 
was unbelievable but for me was cool
really<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.490> be<00:05:14.580> part<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:15.449> don't<00:05:15.630> look

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
really to be part of it and I don't look

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.629 
really to be part of it and I don't look
back<00:05:15.960> at<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.680> think<00:05:17.190> this<00:05:17.340> was<00:05:17.490> much

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
back at that and think this was much

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.550 
back at that and think this was much
most<00:05:17.910> most<00:05:18.180> crushing<00:05:18.419> loss<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.990> my<00:05:19.110> life<00:05:19.259> I

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
most most crushing loss in my life I

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.379 
most most crushing loss in my life I
don't<00:05:19.979> see<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.400> way<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.610> see<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:20.970> as

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
don't see it that way I see it as

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.850 
don't see it that way I see it as
something<00:05:21.780> more<00:05:21.900> positive<00:05:22.110> actually<00:05:22.560> because

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
something more positive actually because

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.820 
something more positive actually because
I<00:05:22.949> already<00:05:23.130> had<00:05:23.370> won<00:05:23.960> five<00:05:24.960> or<00:05:25.020> six<00:05:25.620> now

with<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.479> fans<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.080> that's<00:05:44.010> what<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.699> think

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
with the fans and that's what so I think

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.909 
with the fans and that's what so I think
so<00:05:45.210> beautiful<00:05:45.840> about<00:05:45.990> sports<00:05:46.410> and<00:05:46.590> generally

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
so beautiful about sports and generally

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.980 
so beautiful about sports and generally
just<00:05:47.039> don't<00:05:47.280> know<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.610> outcome<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.270> you<00:05:48.720> see
