00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 - We were given a letter or not 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 here on the desk 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.840
 which does not stress at this age all 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 the program but if we want to execute it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.400
 we say yes 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.610
 having said that, we will have to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.610
 open another little window 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.090
 good to make me take a little bit 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.770

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.990
 here is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.630
 there should not be this advantage 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.040
 here is a word that disconnect you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.119
 we connect 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.130
 and that connects us to several servers 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.430
 several servers that tell us about 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.430
 bridges to go anonymously 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.650
 there is no Internet 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 and this browser will open for us 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.420
 failure to light them congratulations 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.440
 these are destroying the configuration 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.570
 for all 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.980
 this means that you are already a friend already 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.570
 you are browsing anonymously 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 Internet 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.500
 if you have to use it for example with the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.890
 You can configure chrome with the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.890
 average 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.340
