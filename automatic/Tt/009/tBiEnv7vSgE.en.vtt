00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.570
 Hi, guys and girls, how are you? 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.220
 I am carme and welcome to my channel to 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.470
 this a recipe that I love that is 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.840
 super pretty and it looks like it could be a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.669
 super cool detail with your partner or with 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.189
 some friend and they are the cookies of the 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.509
 Personalized fortune are cookies that 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.669
 We can fill in with our own 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.349
 messages about a proverb or with 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.779
 some motivating phrase for the person 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.510
 that we also want is a recipe 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.370
 simple and very quick to do what you can 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.649
 do nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.350
 five minutes the first thing we're going to 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.840
 need are 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.100
 pulverized if it is possible to sift what 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.980
 because it would be much better 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.129
 we would avoid lumps 100 grams of 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.129
 flour 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.360
 three egg whites 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.670
 60 grams of butter that is 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.369
 preferably melted 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.680
 Vanilla essence to taste can be 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.960
 a capita a teaspoon 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
 we are going to take a bowl and in it we are going to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 add the powdered sugar and 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 egg whites what are we going to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.270
 do is the following let's beat 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 up to a point of snow 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.620
 intermediate and what we're going to do is go 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.510
 adding little by little of our flour 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.340
 sifted and with this what we are going to 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.260
 get is that there is absolutely no 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
 no group in our mass that remains 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.680
 completely homogeneous now what 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 let's do it with the help of our 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.810
 rod again beat the whole mixture 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.400
 everything until it is completely 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.710
 homogeneous now let's add our 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
 capful of vanilla essence if you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.450
 prefer they can also add some 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 another kind of lemon orange science 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.940
 or lemon zest what you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.470
 prefer and again we mix again 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 Now what we are going to do is add 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.940
 all our melted butter the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.440
 We can melt in the microwave or in 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.420
 a pan taking care that no 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.979
 come to foam or burn 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 and we stir again 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 since we have all the ingredients 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.300
 well mixed what we are going to do is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.760
 let our dough rest for 15 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.610
 minutes let's cover the bowl with a 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.400
 paper film a transparent paper and what 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.370
 let's leave aside after 15 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.910
 minutes let's take a paper plate of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.230
 oven or paper butter and a paper 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.330
 normal in which we're going to draw a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.819
 circle this circle will serve us 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.380
 mold then what are we going to do as 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.319
 can see is with the lyon in the spoon 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.600
 go adding little by little mixture and that 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.730
 There is a very thin layer covering all 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.799
 the circumference that circumference 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 It is about 10 centimeters in diameter if 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.049
 you want you can do it much more 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 little 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.590
 I help him simply with the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.630
 edge of a glass we remove the guide 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 paper and now we can enter the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.280
 dish to the microwave we put it to the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.260
 minimum power for at least one 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 minute doing all the time without that 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100
 we are going to burn out the plate 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 of the microwave and what we're going to do 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.269
 now it is without it going to cool the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.220
 cookie we are going to double our message 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.530
 we are going to put it in the middle of 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.840
 little circle and we are going to fold as if 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.150
 we were to make a 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.760
 we unfold the paper cookie 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.769
 oven and very carefully we take the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.110
 edge of a glass and we grab the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.120
 tips the cookie and we fold it 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.890
 so that we can keep the form we can 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.750
 put a glass inside the glass 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.940
 be small and after a few minutes 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 this is the result that they will have a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.440
 crunchy cookie delicious and with a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.879
 special message inside I hope that 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.310
 you liked the video I send a 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.310
 very big kiss and we see 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.319
