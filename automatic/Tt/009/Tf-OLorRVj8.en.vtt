fortunately there's also an arcade mode
which<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:03.000> actually<00:03:03.690> better<00:03:03.930> than<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.230> story

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
concept is still interesting but I was

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.370 
concept is still interesting but I was
really<00:03:14.670> disappointed<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> way<00:03:16.170> this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
really disappointed with the way this

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.650 
really disappointed with the way this
version<00:03:16.650> turned<00:03:17.100> out<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.640> had<00:03:17.880> high<00:03:18.150> hopes<00:03:18.450> for

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
version turned out I had high hopes for

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.710 
version turned out I had high hopes for
gem<00:03:19.110> smashers<00:03:19.320> but<00:03:20.160> unfortunately<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.570> a

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
gem smashers but unfortunately it's a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.970 
gem smashers but unfortunately it's a
shadow<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.290> its<00:03:22.440> former<00:03:22.530> self<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.490> 3ds
