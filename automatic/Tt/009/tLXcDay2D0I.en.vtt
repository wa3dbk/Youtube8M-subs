00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.890
 "This news worried us yesterday, and today 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.480
 probably not in vain after the decommissioning of a disposal operation 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.260
 in Coesfeld the first results of the investigation became known today 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.790
 after quickly determining that stored oil there has that 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.320
 District Government Münster first notes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.830
 On the environmental toxin PCB the CD is highly carcinogenic otherwise so 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
 the waste disposal company will remain closed until further notice 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.680
 No comment is made today by the Coesfelder 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.820
 Company recordings on the site are not allowed 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.280
 what he can see from the outside does not make him trustworthy 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.030
 Environmental expert of the district government the crow flies is here today for the third time 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.470
 he tells us was the negligent storage of the Altkönig 2 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 that's the point, of course they see that and Pröll 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.370
 All Pröll would not be allowed to do that and that is the reason 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.480
 why we intervened 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.010
 The head of the company should be heard so we are currently in his finca in Mallorca 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.350
 He is accused here of 100,000 liters of waste oil illegally 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.380
 specifically on forbidden areas in banned containers the particular 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 dangerous shows up in the laboratory of the State Office for Environmental Protection in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.410
 Recklinghausen 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.720
 After a first quick sample, there are first suspicions that part of the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 Liquid PCB could be stressed and therefore it is not to be joking 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.710
 that's just Stoffel very carcinogenic is very carcinogenic and eventually 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 is very harmful to health 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.689
 and so use such now so lets avoid and thus has the contact 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.560
 and of course not into the groundwater 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.940
 only in the past week, the district government of Münster had this 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.340
 Disposal company in Gelsenkirchen shut down 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.880
 the pcb load here was a thousandfold higher than the legal one 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 Threshold after that there was a confidential reference to the big one 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.720
 Duel of the companies in this case now also determines the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.399
 Prosecutor's Office Münster if the suspicions are confirmed 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.529
 that would be a violation of the waste law 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.239
 It's going to be the winner on $ 26 and that's with the start or max 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.809
 imprisoned for up to five years 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.639
 What else he can do in Berlin what happened there 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.429
 but so no detailed overview I just heard that 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.229
 There are numerous barrels and, as I said, tank trucks should stand 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.930
 Thole filled with waste oil for employees and environment closes the 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.040
 District government meanwhile no longer 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.489
 There are no immediate residents, but the company also has the worries 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.839
 economic reasons 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.369
 "The mood is natural 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.799
 Percent tense because we have shut down the entire operation that is 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.119
 So now they do not make any money at the moment, so only money costs them 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.189
 have to pay their employees 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.089
 astonishing only in August, the company was more professional 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.640
 Disposal company certified by Tüv 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.889
 now everything is tight 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.949
 for the time being 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.069
 Swagger Lukas Haxter houses maggots 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.829
 Let's take a look at local people from the rabbit 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.040
 get his extra money even look at the chocolate production 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.219
 starting at 7pm local time it's very close to the wall
