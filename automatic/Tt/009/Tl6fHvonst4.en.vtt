believe<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.340> duality<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
believe that there is a duality in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
believe that there is a duality in the
definition<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.589> love<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> define<00:01:05.400> both

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
definition of love and you define both

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.920 
definition of love and you define both
um<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.530> perceived<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.970> principle

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
um it could be perceived as a principle

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.100 
um it could be perceived as a principle
as<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.820> concept<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> love<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
as in what is your concept of love and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.039 
as in what is your concept of love and
then<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.040> also<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.580> perceived<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.240> emotion

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
then it can also be perceived as emotion

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
then it can also be perceived as emotion
for<00:01:16.320> instance<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> feelings<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.729> get
