is<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.450> testing<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> animatronics

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
is just testing with the animatronics

is just testing with the animatronics
what<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.450> see<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
what what to see what they look like and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.109 
what what to see what they look like and
also<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.689> tweeted<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.290> owl<00:02:01.670> animatronic<00:02:02.670> back

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
also he tweeted an owl animatronic back

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
also he tweeted an owl animatronic back
at<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> creatures<00:02:04.110> Creature<00:02:04.649> Shop<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
at the creatures Creature Shop is just a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.749 
at the creatures Creature Shop is just a
prototype<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.659> animatronics<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.039> Gil<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.610> get

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
prototype of animatronics so Gil can get

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
prototype of animatronics so Gil can get
some<00:02:09.000> inspiration<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
some inspiration on what the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.130 
some inspiration on what the
animatronics<00:02:11.520> need<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.000> look<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.720> what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
animatronics need to look like and what

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.680 
animatronics need to look like and what
the<00:02:13.170> mech

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
the mech

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.340

anacs need to be and finally yesterday

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.180 
anacs need to be and finally yesterday
you<00:02:18.040> tweeted<00:02:18.520> let's<00:02:18.850> celebrate<00:02:19.210> decay<00:02:20.050> k<00:02:20.770> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
you tweeted let's celebrate decay k and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.800 
you tweeted let's celebrate decay k and
it's<00:02:21.790> actually<00:02:22.330> an<00:02:22.450> image<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:23.110> an<00:02:23.440> animatronic

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
it's actually an image of an animatronic

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
it's actually an image of an animatronic
endoskeleton<00:02:25.810> prototype<00:02:26.650> where<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.130> see

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
endoskeleton prototype where you can see

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.580 
endoskeleton prototype where you can see
its<00:02:27.520> teeth<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> actually<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.320> its

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
its teeth and you can actually see its

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.430 
its teeth and you can actually see its
eyeballs<00:02:30.250> at<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.550> top<00:02:30.790> there<00:02:31.150> as<00:02:31.360> well<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
eyeballs at the top there as well like I

I<00:02:33.310> feel<00:02:33.550> like<00:02:33.730> Gil<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:34.740> experimenting

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
I feel like Gil is just experimenting

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.220 
I feel like Gil is just experimenting
with<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.100> animatronics<00:02:36.850> what<00:02:37.090> what<00:02:37.660> he<00:02:37.840> wants

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
with the animatronics what what he wants

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.230 
with the animatronics what what he wants
them<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.620> look<00:02:38.800> like<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:39.790> could<00:02:40.090> be

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
them to look like this could be

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480 
them to look like this could be
something<00:02:40.480> he's<00:02:40.810> made<00:02:41.080> himself<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:41.950> it's

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
something he's made himself or it's

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.280 
something he's made himself or it's
actually<00:02:42.700> just<00:02:43.090> something<00:02:43.510> he<00:02:43.600> saw<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
actually just something he saw on the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.530 
actually just something he saw on the
shelves<00:02:44.800> at<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:44.950> Creature<00:02:45.370> Shop<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
shelves at the Creature Shop like a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.810 
shelves at the Creature Shop like a
little<00:02:46.750> prototype<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.770> how<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.950> animatronics

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
little prototype of how the animatronics

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.690 
little prototype of how the animatronics
need<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.270> work<00:02:49.540> because<00:02:50.260> these<00:02:50.680> teeth<00:02:51.070> look

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
need to work because these teeth look

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.790 
need to work because these teeth look
very<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:52.360> strange<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> original

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
very very strange to the original

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.280 
very very strange to the original
animatronics<00:02:54.610> what<00:02:54.940> we<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.540> people<00:02:55.780> were

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
animatronics what we know of people were

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.860 
animatronics what we know of people were
saying<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.680> could<00:02:56.920> be<00:02:57.090> spring-trap<00:02:58.090> but<00:02:58.570> again

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
saying it could be spring-trap but again

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.680 
saying it could be spring-trap but again
it's<00:02:59.140> not<00:02:59.260> very<00:02:59.440> similar<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.280> Springs

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's not very similar to Springs

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.590 
it's not very similar to Springs
springtrap's<00:03:01.690> teeth<00:03:02.020> they<00:03:02.560> are<00:03:02.590> very<00:03:03.070> part<00:03:03.760> so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
springtrap's teeth they are very part so

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.540 
springtrap's teeth they are very part so
you<00:03:04.660> know<00:03:04.990> folks<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.650> feel<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.070> he's<00:03:06.310> just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
you know folks I feel like he's just

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120 
you know folks I feel like he's just
experimenting<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.920> looking<00:03:08.920> for

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
experimenting and looking for

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.250 
experimenting and looking for
inspiration<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.540> animatronics

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
inspiration on what the animatronics

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
inspiration on what the animatronics
need<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:12.070> because<00:03:12.460> like<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.700> said

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
need to be like because like I said

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.830 
need to be like because like I said
folks<00:03:13.330> Gil<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.930> still<00:03:14.580> writing<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.790> film<00:03:16.060> so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
folks Gil is still writing the film so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.440 
folks Gil is still writing the film so
he<00:03:17.800> doesn't<00:03:18.160> even<00:03:18.220> know<00:03:18.520> what<00:03:18.700> animatronics

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
he doesn't even know what animatronics

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.970 
he doesn't even know what animatronics
are<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:20.020> in<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> film<00:03:20.560> yet<00:03:20.830> of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
are going to be in the film yet of

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.490 
are going to be in the film yet of
obviously<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.030> original<00:03:22.150> gang<00:03:22.720> are<00:03:23.020> going<00:03:23.350> to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
obviously the original gang are going to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
obviously the original gang are going to
be<00:03:23.650> probably<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.180> know<00:03:25.330> what<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.570> mean

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
be probably but you know what I mean

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.070 
be probably but you know what I mean
folks<00:03:26.230> he<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.660> experimenting<00:03:28.660> this<00:03:28.870> is

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
folks he is just experimenting this is

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.470 
folks he is just experimenting this is
not<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.770> final<00:03:30.370> verdict<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.150> what<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
not the final verdict of what the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.750 
not the final verdict of what the
animatronic<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.230> going<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.650> look<00:03:32.860> like<00:03:32.890> he's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
animatronic is going to look like he's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.420 
animatronic is going to look like he's
just<00:03:34.030> going<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.540> places<00:03:35.200> where<00:03:35.620> animatronics

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
just going to places where animatronics

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.790 
just going to places where animatronics
are<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:37.450> for<00:03:37.690> experiments<00:03:38.350> but<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.680> is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
are just for experiments but that is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.320 
are just for experiments but that is
just<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.250> month<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.060> my<00:03:40.239> opinion

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
just the month that is just my opinion

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.690 
just the month that is just my opinion
folks<00:03:40.959> that's<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:41.410> think<00:03:41.920> because<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.550> lot

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
folks that's what I think because a lot

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.340 
folks that's what I think because a lot
of<00:03:42.820> people<00:03:43.090> were<00:03:43.180> saying<00:03:43.390> oh<00:03:43.660> my<00:03:43.900> god<00:03:44.200> this

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
of people were saying oh my god this

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.509 
of people were saying oh my god this
looks<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.830> crap

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
looks like crap

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.699 
looks like crap
look<00:03:45.850> at<00:03:45.970> all<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> decay<00:03:46.660> on<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.019> look<00:03:47.470> at<00:03:47.590> what

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
look at all the decay on it look at what

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.620 
look at all the decay on it look at what
the<00:03:47.860> teeth<00:03:48.130> look<00:03:48.430> like<00:03:48.700> look<00:03:49.209> at<00:03:49.330> where<00:03:49.510> he's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
the teeth look like look at where he's

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.900 
the teeth look like look at where he's
place<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.200> teeth<00:03:50.470> look<00:03:50.739> at<00:03:50.860> all<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.610> wax

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
place the teeth look at all the the wax

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.150 
place the teeth look at all the the wax
and<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.360> rubber<00:03:52.630> attached<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.709> looks<00:03:53.950> like

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
and the rubber attached to it looks like

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.000 
and the rubber attached to it looks like
absolute<00:03:54.760> crap<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.630> I've<00:03:55.780> told<00:03:56.200> them<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.950> I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
absolute crap but I've told them that I

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.190 
absolute crap but I've told them that I
think<00:03:57.250> he's<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:57.610> experimenting<00:03:58.080> trying<00:03:59.080> to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
think he's just experimenting trying to

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.509 
think he's just experimenting trying to
work<00:03:59.380> with<00:03:59.650> prototypes<00:04:00.550> on<00:04:00.820> what<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.480> final

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
work with prototypes on what the final

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.320 
work with prototypes on what the final
animatronics<00:04:03.519> are<00:04:03.670> going<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.000> look<00:04:04.150> like

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
animatronics are going to look like

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.270 
animatronics are going to look like
because<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.690> think<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> great<00:04:05.560> way<00:04:05.860> to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
because I think this is a great way to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.550 
because I think this is a great way to
learn<00:04:06.790> about<00:04:07.090> animatronics<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.350> think

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
learn about animatronics and I think

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.990 
learn about animatronics and I think
it's<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.769> great<00:04:08.980> way<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.220> get<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.700> final

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
it's a great way to get the final

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390 
it's a great way to get the final
