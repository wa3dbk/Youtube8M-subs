00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
went to Jamaica and afterwards so um I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.670 
went to Jamaica and afterwards so um I
have<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.490> say<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> bit<00:00:27.869> hesitant<00:00:28.170> at

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
have to say that I was a bit hesitant at

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
have to say that I was a bit hesitant at
first<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.220> read<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:29.820> after<00:00:30.390> twisted<00:00:30.900> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
first to read it because after twisted I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.700 
first to read it because after twisted I
really<00:00:31.500> thought<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.940> lame<00:00:33.300> and

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
really thought that it was just lame and

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
really thought that it was just lame and
it<00:00:34.710> didn't<00:00:35.219> work<00:00:35.489> well<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:36.660> glad<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.930> give

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it didn't work well but I'm glad I give

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.540 
it didn't work well but I'm glad I give
this<00:00:37.320> another<00:00:37.469> chance<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.070> actually

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
this another chance because actually

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.959 
this another chance because actually
really<00:00:38.940> enjoyed<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> gave<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> 4<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> 5

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
really enjoyed it I gave it a 4 out of 5

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.920 
really enjoyed it I gave it a 4 out of 5
probably<00:00:41.969> more<00:00:42.149> towards<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> four<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> half

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
probably more towards a four and a half

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720 
probably more towards a four and a half
out<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> five<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.920> since<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.550> give

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
out of five but since I can only give

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.540 
out of five but since I can only give
single<00:00:45.149> star<00:00:45.360> ratings<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
single star ratings I don't think it's a

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
single star ratings I don't think it's a
five<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.780> either<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
five but it's not for either you know so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.270 
five but it's not for either you know so
anyway<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.600> enjoyed<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> um<00:00:52.890> with

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
anyway I really enjoyed it um with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.750 
anyway I really enjoyed it um with
twisted<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.750> felt<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.489> Sara<00:00:56.489> Shepard

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
twisted I really felt like Sara Shepard

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
twisted I really felt like Sara Shepard
didn't<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:57.600> she<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.199> doing

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
didn't really know what she was doing

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
didn't really know what she was doing
and<00:00:58.890> she<00:00:58.949> didn't<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> certain<00:01:00.629> direction

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and she didn't have a certain direction

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.540 
and she didn't have a certain direction
where<00:01:01.410> she<00:01:01.590> wanted<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
where she wanted to go with the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.859 
where she wanted to go with the
characters<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> plot<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.979> I<00:01:04.979> think

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
characters in the plot and I think

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.219 
characters in the plot and I think
twisted<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.140> her<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.549> book<00:01:09.119> after<00:01:09.360> wanted

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
twisted was her first book after wanted

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
twisted was her first book after wanted
that<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.530> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> TV<00:01:11.729> show

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that was kind of because of the TV show

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
that was kind of because of the TV show
and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.930> too<00:01:12.990> forced

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and I think it was just way too forced

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
and I think it was just way too forced
and<00:01:14.420> with<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.200> felt<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.619> she<00:01:16.830> had

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and with this one I felt like she had

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
and with this one I felt like she had
more<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.400> direction<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> plot

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
more of a direction and more of a plot

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
more of a direction and more of a plot
and<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:20.250> ideas<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.210> could<00:01:21.390> cover<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> plot

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and more ideas that could cover the plot

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
and more ideas that could cover the plot
because<00:01:22.380> twisted<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.460> ridiculous<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because twisted was just ridiculous it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.359 
because twisted was just ridiculous it
was<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.320> math<00:01:25.530> didn't<00:01:25.920> add<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
was like the math didn't add up and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.649 
was like the math didn't add up and
emily's<00:01:26.729> story<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.570> like

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
emily's story and it was just like

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
emily's story and it was just like
really<00:01:28.140> lame<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
really lame and it's like it was more of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.749 
really lame and it's like it was more of
a<00:01:30.390> fan<00:01:30.630> fiction<00:01:31.079> even<00:01:31.229> than<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:32.070> actual<00:01:32.369> book

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
a fan fiction even than an actual book

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.260 
a fan fiction even than an actual book
by<00:01:33.119> her<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.259> anyway<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.430> ruthless<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
by her but anyway with ruthless I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.460 
by her but anyway with ruthless I
thought<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> story<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.020> much<00:01:37.229> more

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
thought the story was much more

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
thought the story was much more
developed<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.250> thought<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.820> more

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
developed I thought it was more

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
developed I thought it was more
interesting<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.200> felt<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.040> Sara<00:01:41.460> Shepard

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
interesting I felt like Sara Shepard

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.260 
interesting I felt like Sara Shepard
like<00:01:42.119> finally<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.689> back<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> her<00:01:43.320> roots
