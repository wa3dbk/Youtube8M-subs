00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
okay I'm thinking about the joy because

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.750 
okay I'm thinking about the joy because
I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:03.240> will<00:03:03.630> be<00:03:03.750> back<00:03:04.050> oh

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.520 
I think I like that so I will be back oh
it<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:06.060> much<00:03:06.240> dried<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.990> all<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> pink

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
it pretty much dried it all the pink

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.770 
it pretty much dried it all the pink
takes<00:03:07.800> longer<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> dry<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.750> see

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
takes longer to dry and as you can see

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.580 
takes longer to dry and as you can see
these<00:03:10.020> are<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.230> baby<00:03:10.410> wipes<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.040> using<00:03:11.250> I

think<00:03:13.590> they're<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.070> cool<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.310> could<00:03:14.640> use

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
think they're kind of cool you could use

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.520 
think they're kind of cool you could use
them<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.570> your<00:03:15.600> page<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.050> different<00:03:16.350> ways<00:03:16.470> so

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
them in your page in different ways so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.730 
them in your page in different ways so
you<00:03:16.920> could<00:03:17.420> my<00:03:18.420> future<00:03:18.840> journal<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.620> on

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
the side okay so I just had this vision
in<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:23.850> mind<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.450> one<00:03:24.720> girl<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:26.430> hour<00:03:26.610> journal

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
in my mind of one girl one hour journal

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.110 
in my mind of one girl one hour journal
and<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:27.690> was<00:03:27.990> going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.200> title<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:30.000> i

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
and that's was going to title it and i

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.680 
and that's was going to title it and i
actually<00:03:30.270> just<00:03:30.450> cut<00:03:31.020> this<00:03:31.140> out<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.500> magazine

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
actually just cut this out of a magazine

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.980 
actually just cut this out of a magazine
so<00:03:33.690> if<00:03:33.810> they<00:03:33.930> abused<00:03:34.260> her<00:03:34.440> before<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.480> she<00:03:36.480> was

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
so if they abused her before and she was

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.420 
so if they abused her before and she was
actually<00:03:37.170> too<00:03:37.440> tall<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.800> page<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.220> cut

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
actually too tall for the page so I cut

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.740 
actually too tall for the page so I cut
her<00:03:38.490> legs<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.330> glued<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> back

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
her legs up and then glued it back

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.390 
her legs up and then glued it back
together<00:03:40.050> again<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.710> I<00:03:40.770> don't<00:03:40.950> know<00:03:41.040> how<00:03:41.190> it'll

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
together again so I don't know how it'll

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.890 
together again so I don't know how it'll
come<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:41.970> they<00:03:42.060> look<00:03:42.210> kind<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.450> funny<00:03:42.630> or

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
come out but they look kind of funny or

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.040 
come out but they look kind of funny or
not<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.320> wasn't<00:03:43.950> sure<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.640> should<00:03:47.960> sort<00:03:48.960> of

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
not I wasn't sure if I should sort of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.020 
not I wasn't sure if I should sort of
have<00:03:49.230> her<00:03:49.470> walking<00:03:49.710> off<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:50.610> that's<00:03:50.760> good

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
have her walking off I think that's good

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.590 
have her walking off I think that's good
I<00:03:51.360> just<00:03:52.050> think<00:03:52.170> his<00:03:52.380> black<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:54.300> is<00:03:54.450> all<00:03:54.570> I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
I just think his black this is all I

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:03.199 
I just think his black this is all I
guess<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.530> then<00:04:01.770> I'm<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.310> allow<00:04:02.550> her<00:04:02.880> to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
guess and then I'm going to allow her to

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.530 
guess and then I'm going to allow her to
dry<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.370> don't<00:04:05.370> take<00:04:05.580> her<00:04:05.700> off<00:04:05.880> until<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.300> dry

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
dry I don't take her off until this dry

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.540 
dry I don't take her off until this dry
I've<00:04:06.720> done<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.080> before<00:04:07.500> with<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.890> impatience

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
I've done that before with my impatience

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.970 
I've done that before with my impatience
just<00:04:08.730> because<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.000> Sotiris<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.709> looks

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
just because of Sotiris what it looks

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.050 
just because of Sotiris what it looks
