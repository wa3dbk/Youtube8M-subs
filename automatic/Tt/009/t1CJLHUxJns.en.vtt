that is going to be a color that is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800 
that is going to be a color that is
similar<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.729> natural<00:01:05.880> lip<00:01:06.240> color<00:01:06.270> put<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
natural and you have to have one that is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
natural and you have to have one that is
soft<00:01:10.320> enough<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> goes<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.630> an

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
soft enough and it goes down in an

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.910 
soft enough and it goes down in an
opaque<00:01:13.229> manner<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.640> does

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
opaque manner so that it really does

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
opaque manner so that it really does
create<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.520> colors<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.720> where

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
create the colors so you don't see where

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.960 
create the colors so you don't see where
your<00:01:19.080> natural<00:01:19.500> color<00:01:19.740> ends<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.580> lip<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
your natural color ends on your lip and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
your natural color ends on your lip and
where<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.420> skin<00:01:21.630> color<00:01:21.869> starts<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
where your skin color starts it has to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.850 
where your skin color starts it has to
be<00:01:22.680> able<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> extend<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:24.560> how<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
be able to extend that how do you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
be able to extend that how do you
contour<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.640> were<00:01:26.729> talking<00:01:26.970> about<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.210> day

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
contour we were talking about this day

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
contour we were talking about this day
to<00:01:27.450> day<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.960> don't<00:01:28.409> understand<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to day and I don't understand the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.300 
to day and I don't understand the
concept<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.860> contouring

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
concept of that I think that contouring

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
concept of that I think that contouring
is<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.970> very<00:01:33.360> important<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
is very very important and it's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.890 
is very very important and it's
something<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:35.180> laura<00:01:36.180> geller<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.750> got

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
something that laura geller really got

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
something that laura geller really got
me<00:01:37.049> started<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.470> mm-hmm

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
me started on mm-hmm

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.060 
me started on mm-hmm
but<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.229> use<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> darker<00:01:40.860> color

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
but what I use is I use a darker color
