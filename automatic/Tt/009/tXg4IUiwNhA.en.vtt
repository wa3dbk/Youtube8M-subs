00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello I'm pete in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.990
 talk to them about something that is very basic but 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 many people do not know how to do it yet very 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.490
 well and these are the courses or lizard 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.120
 these are bases that they have to learn 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.300
 super good since the technique involved 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.640
 the pulse is going to be fundamental so that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 in the gym you do not progress better 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.340
 exercise you can do it with the technique 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.980
 perfect and those really work 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 muscles and work those muscles before 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 to start doing a pulse to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.399
 any exercise the first thing that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 you have to know is who muscle are you going to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.809
 work in this case although it is very 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.270
 basic and it is understood that by lizard 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.460
 you work on the breasts not only goes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.739
 to work this region also 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.039
 indirectly they work shoulder and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 you work triceps a little bit of the bice but 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.110
 above all it's sad and man but it's 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.530
 that's why you should always focus on 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.829
 work on the chest so that what more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.710
 work be the chest if that is the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.299
 objective that you have is the muscle 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 is worked in the end there are different 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.260
 types of pujols that you can make them 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.920
 I will show below for 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.960
 work either breast or work on 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
 all the triceps in this first example 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 I'm going to show you the most normal pulse 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 is to work on all the chest the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.350
 hands go to a more open level than their 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.080
 shoulders you're going to keep your body upright 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 the head keep it totally also 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.210
 upright you will go down to almost level 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.759
 parallel to the breasts you return to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.009
 climb without blocking elbows this second 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 variation is to put more emphasis on 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.330
 the sad one in this case until closing more 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 your hands put them almost in the shape of 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.340
 diamond you're going to go down completely that almost 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.009
 your chest touch the ground remember always 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 keep the body completely straight to the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.929
 Just as the head does not reach the neck 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.539
 you go back up and in this case if you go to 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.340
 Stretch totally blocking elbows and from 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.899
 back in this variation of the course 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
 although I want to leave a little more 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.280
 basic so you can first control 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.259
 and do a good technique if you want 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.399
 work the core this pulse is going to 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.979
 help a lot 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.700
 the idea is that like the first 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.800
 pulse 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.800
 it happens to be exactly the same but 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.739
 when going down you are going to take one of your 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 knees to the side and you go up and take it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.790
 back and so you do with the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 left that will work not only 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 the chest but also your obliques and 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.599
 part of his court and good that last 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.269
 judgment they saw has name is called 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.650
 spider put by spiderman trials to the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.739
 empty I do not know why I think that when 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.330
 you are going down and it is this movement 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.360
 it looks like it's like spider-man 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.489
 but the important thing is that this is how they are 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.640
 the pulses there are many very many 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.160
 different ways to make them but 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.410
 here the important thing is that it dominates minimum 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.989
 the first two and hard you dominate how it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.970
 from the basics and you put a 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.530
 Youtube video and you want to see how 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.230
 make the Aztecs so I do not know 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.120
 how much mother of other courses there is going to 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.610
 have problems you can hurt yourself and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.370
 I'm sure the muscle will not work 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.860
 as if you work it is doing the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 technique and putting all the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.870
 concentration on that muscle worked 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.390
 do not forget to check my other videos

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.600
 technique or type of exercise they would like 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.069
 that showed them these lizards 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.590
 I made them for a comment that 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.060
 they did so I really read them and the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.320
 degrees and well see you until the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.320
