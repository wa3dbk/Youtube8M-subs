loaded<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> simple<00:01:14.640> waveform<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.750> let's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
loaded the simple waveform so let's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.580 
loaded the simple waveform so let's
trigger<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.770> new<00:01:17.009> VJ<00:01:17.400> console<00:01:18.590> and

that the live generator automatically

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
that the live generator automatically
responds<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> audio<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.060> coming<00:01:27.360> into

responds to the audio that's coming into
our<00:01:27.600> computer<00:01:29.420> let's<00:01:30.420> trigger<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
our computer let's trigger some of the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
our computer let's trigger some of the
other<00:01:31.290> live<00:01:31.530> generators<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> one's

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
other live generators and that one's

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.160 
other live generators and that one's
responding<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:41.509> we<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> also<00:01:42.810> apply

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
responding as well we can also apply

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
responding as well we can also apply
effects<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:49.460> mix<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.790> other

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
effects to these and mix them with other

effects to these and mix them with other
video<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.479> we'd<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.180 

let's<00:01:55.830> try<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.520> texts<00:01:57.920> let's<00:01:58.920> load<00:01:59.160> up

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
let's try one of the texts let's load up

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.140 
let's try one of the texts let's load up
big<00:01:59.580> scroll<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> video<00:02:05.400> clip<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.970> some

big scroll we have a video clip of some

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.550 
big scroll we have a video clip of some
batteries<00:02:06.600> over<00:02:06.900> here<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.260> we're<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
batteries over here that we're going to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:19.250 
batteries over here that we're going to
play<00:02:14.660> let's<00:02:15.660> type<00:02:15.870> everlasting<00:02:18.170> into<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
play let's type everlasting into the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.460 
play let's type everlasting into the
text<00:02:19.560> generator<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.720> let's<00:02:21.990> trigger<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
text generator and let's trigger that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.870 
text generator and let's trigger that
text<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:25.980> see<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> applies<00:02:26.850> to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
text you can see that it applies to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:43.640 
text you can see that it applies to
effects<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:42.350> there<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> lot<00:02:43.620> of

effects as well there are a lot of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.290 
effects as well there are a lot of
choices<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.310> adding<00:02:44.550> text<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.030> we're<00:02:45.120> just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
choices for adding text and we're just

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.490 
choices for adding text and we're just
showing<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.630> one<00:02:45.780> example<00:02:45.900> here<00:02:48.350> another<00:02:49.350> way

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
