headphone type person I prefer using

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.130 
headphone type person I prefer using
earphones<00:01:22.820> instead<00:01:23.450> because<00:01:23.780> it's<00:01:23.960> much

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
earphones instead because it's much

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.779 
earphones instead because it's much
smaller<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:24.979> more<00:01:25.100> convenient<00:01:25.460> for<00:01:25.670> me<00:01:25.700> to

smaller and more convenient for me to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:26.620 
smaller and more convenient for me to

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
carry it around

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.180 
carry it around
I<00:01:26.720> always<00:01:27.170> keep<00:01:27.380> my<00:01:27.440> earphones<00:01:27.800> on<00:01:27.950> me<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.159> I

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
I always keep my earphones on me and I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.070 
I always keep my earphones on me and I
use<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.610> gym<00:01:28.819> however<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.360> do<00:01:29.450> see<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.899> lot

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
use it at the gym however I do see a lot

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.839

of<00:01:30.110> people<00:01:30.380> use<00:01:30.530> headphones<00:01:30.709> as<00:01:31.069> well<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.580> guess

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
of people use headphones as well I guess

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:33.190 
of people use headphones as well I guess
it's<00:01:32.239> more<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.539> personal<00:01:32.959> preference

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's more of a personal preference

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.089 
really I mean headphones do provide
noise<00:01:35.660> cancellation<00:01:36.289> because<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.679> does<00:01:36.860> cover

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
noise cancellation because it does cover

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.100 
noise cancellation because it does cover
the<00:01:37.280> whole<00:01:37.399> ear<00:01:37.610> whereas<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.450> earphones<00:01:38.869> do

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
it's going to take a look at the first

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.660 
it's going to take a look at the first
item<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> charging<00:02:34.220> brick<00:02:34.400> here

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
item we have the charging brick here

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.910 
item we have the charging brick here
which<00:02:34.820> has<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> pretty<00:02:35.540> cool<00:02:35.780> design<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.740> can

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
which has a pretty cool design you can

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.559 
which has a pretty cool design you can
also<00:02:37.100> fold<00:02:37.430> them<00:02:37.580> if<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> want<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.360> mean

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
also fold them if you want I mean

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.880 
also fold them if you want I mean
it's<00:02:38.659> pretty<00:02:38.870> standard<00:02:39.049> for<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.409> most<00:02:39.620> part

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
it's pretty standard for the most part

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.589 
it's pretty standard for the most part
so<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.159> gotta<00:02:40.340> move<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.549> to<00:02:40.730> item<00:02:41.090> number<00:02:41.120> two

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
so it's gotta move on to item number two

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.149 
so it's gotta move on to item number two
this<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.109> one<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.409> three<00:02:42.590> cables<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.069> it

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
this is one of the three cables that it

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.920 
this is one of the three cables that it
comes<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.969> one<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.329> particular<00:02:44.480> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
comes with this one in particular is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.629 
comes with this one in particular is
probably<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.499> be<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.799> most<00:02:46.069> used<00:02:46.370> one

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
probably going to be the most used one

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.580 
probably going to be the most used one
simply<00:02:47.120> because<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.629> is<00:02:47.719> the<00:02:47.840> cable<00:02:48.170> needed<00:02:48.499> to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
simply because it is the cable needed to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.440 
simply because it is the cable needed to
charge<00:02:48.859> your<00:02:49.069> headphones<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.269> next

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
charge your headphones so this next

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.819 
charge your headphones so this next
cable<00:02:50.689> is<00:02:50.900> most<00:02:51.079> likely<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.499> to<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.620> used

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
cable is most likely going to be used

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.679 
cable is most likely going to be used
over<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> last<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.879> because<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.299> one<00:02:53.540> has<00:02:53.569> a

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
over the last one because this one has a

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.319 
over the last one because this one has a
remote<00:02:54.019> talk<00:02:54.319> one<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:55.219> is<00:02:55.340> an<00:02:55.459> L<00:02:55.579> jack<00:02:55.909> whereas

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
remote talk one end is an L jack whereas

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.819 
remote talk one end is an L jack whereas
the<00:02:56.569> other<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.959> straight<00:02:57.290> Jack<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.739> it's

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
the other is a straight Jack and it's

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.140 
the other is a straight Jack and it's
like<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.280> because<00:02:58.609> it<00:02:58.760> gives<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
like that because it gives you the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.179 
like that because it gives you the
choice<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.750> which<00:03:00.409> end<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.680> want<00:03:00.889> to<00:03:00.950> connect

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
choice of which end you want to connect

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.860 
choice of which end you want to connect
to<00:03:01.280> your<00:03:01.340> phone<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:01.819> your<00:03:02.120> phone<00:03:02.359> has<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.689> case

preventing an L jack connection and this

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.000 
preventing an L jack connection and this
last<00:03:05.450> cable<00:03:05.689> is<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.959> basic<00:03:06.379> cable<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.709> no

last cable is a basic cable with no

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.709 
last cable is a basic cable with no
remote<00:03:07.340> talk<00:03:07.669> I'm<00:03:07.939> guessing<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.419> is<00:03:08.480> for

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
remote talk I'm guessing this is for

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.050 
remote talk I'm guessing this is for
iPod<00:03:09.019> users<00:03:09.409> but<00:03:09.769> phone<00:03:10.189> users<00:03:10.489> can<00:03:10.639> also<00:03:10.730> use

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
iPod users but phone users can also use

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.909 
iPod users but phone users can also use
it<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.329> spare<00:03:11.719> if<00:03:11.959> they<00:03:12.200> wish<00:03:12.379> this<00:03:12.739> is

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
it as a spare if they wish this is

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.319 
it as a spare if they wish this is
something<00:03:13.250> I've<00:03:13.340> never<00:03:13.489> seen<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:13.819> other<00:03:14.030> Beats

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
something I've never seen in other Beats

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.970 
something I've never seen in other Beats
products<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.959> think<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.379> something<00:03:15.680> new<00:03:15.829> they

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
products I think it's something new they

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.220 
products I think it's something new they
introduced<00:03:16.400> I'm<00:03:16.639> not<00:03:16.849> really<00:03:17.060> sure<00:03:17.329> but<00:03:17.359> this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
introduced I'm not really sure but this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.809 
introduced I'm not really sure but this
is<00:03:18.379> a<00:03:18.409> clip<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.709> can<00:03:18.949> attach<00:03:19.219> to<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.489> carrying

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
is a clip you can attach to the carrying

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.849 
is a clip you can attach to the carrying
case<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.299> headphones<00:03:20.689> and<00:03:20.989> return<00:03:21.469> attach

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
case of the headphones and return attach

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.259 
case of the headphones and return attach
it<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.099> your<00:03:22.129> belt<00:03:22.370> if<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:22.699> wish<00:03:22.849> to

want to carry it in their hands or maybe

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.599 
want to carry it in their hands or maybe
it's<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.930> new<00:03:26.959> trend<00:03:27.349> having<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.219> same<00:03:28.430> from

comes to contact with anything I gotta

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.349 
comes to contact with anything I gotta
say<00:03:42.979> that<00:03:43.159> the<00:03:43.189> material<00:03:43.400> does<00:03:43.909> feel<00:03:44.150> very

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
say that the material does feel very

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.179 
say that the material does feel very
nice<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.750> your<00:03:44.780> hand<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.259> it's<00:03:45.919> very

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
nice in your hand and it's very

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
convenient to grip with just one hand

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.809 
convenient to grip with just one hand
because<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.229> how<00:03:48.349> small<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.859> is<00:03:48.949> I<00:03:49.220> think

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
because of how small it is I think

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.520 
because of how small it is I think
overall<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.299> carrying<00:03:50.720> case<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.139> huge

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
overall this carrying case is a huge

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.009 
overall this carrying case is a huge
improvement<00:03:51.829> than<00:03:52.189> the<00:03:52.310> studio<00:03:52.639> ones<00:03:53.019> finally

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
improvement than the studio ones finally

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.210 
improvement than the studio ones finally
we<00:03:54.109> can<00:03:54.229> take<00:03:54.379> a<00:03:54.409> look<00:03:54.560> at<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.799> headphones

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
we can take a look at the headphones

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
I'll bring this up so we can take a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.210 
I'll bring this up so we can take a

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:03.259 
up showing you how much juice is left in

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.259 
up showing you how much juice is left in
the<00:04:03.349> battery<00:04:03.650> remember<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.909> battery

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
the battery remember that the battery

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.059 
the battery remember that the battery
lasts<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.629> to<00:04:05.659> 30<00:04:06.019> hours<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.829> quick

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
lasts up to 30 hours so for a quick

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.499 
lasts up to 30 hours so for a quick
estimate<00:04:07.250> just<00:04:07.639> think<00:04:07.909> that<00:04:08.030> each<00:04:08.239> light

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
estimate just think that each light

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:12.129 
estimate just think that each light
represents<00:04:09.079> around<00:04:09.169> 7<00:04:09.769> hours<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.870> inside

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
represents around 7 hours so the inside

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.420 
represents around 7 hours so the inside
of<00:04:12.169> this<00:04:12.349> headband<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.829> actually<00:04:13.099> made<00:04:13.250> out<00:04:13.310> of
