00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:25.300
[intro music]

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.620
I was born on a trapline. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.720
I was born in a tent in January.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.600
[music]

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.100
Um. My dad helped my mum deliver me. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.300
I was born out on the land.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.720
[music]

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.750
That's where my father was born down there.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.470
So this is the whole area that my dad was responsible for 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.400
to take care of and now that he's passed 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.190
it's our responsibility, his children, to take care of this land.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.900
[Laughs and inhales]

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.180
[pouring water]

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.120
[securing kettle lid]

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.260
Ta da... 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.480
[Laughs]

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.860
[music]

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.940
[ducks in water]

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.780
What we've committed to is working with the communities, 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.840
with local families to better understand the land 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.670
and the impact that we'll have.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.080
To better understand the cultural and traditional significance of certain areas 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920
around the property, to ensure that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460
again we minimize the impact to culturally sensitive areas.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.760
I'd like to be assured that whatever they do over there,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.480
that it's a healthy environment.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.980
I don't want contaminated land. I don't want pollution.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.340
I don't want that.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.330
We still hunt, trap, and fish.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.540
We enjoy this home of ours.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.120
You know we do everything here.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.820
You know our family is buried here.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.060
There's no way that we'll ever leave.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.800
Are we going to see a bear on the highway? 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.520
[figures roll]

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.620
No.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.300
[sigh and laugh]

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
[music]

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.880
This isn't the middle of nowhere.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.360
This is someone's back yard. 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.370
Building Canada's largest gold mine isn't necessarily about just gold.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.490
You have to understand that you can't do that without people 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.160
and positive working relationships.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.600
Right now the relationship is good.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.180
It's not the best.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.020
It's good.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.260
It's just starting.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.060
I'm hoping that the relationship that we develop with Detour Gold 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.080
will set an example to all companies all over the world,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.820
of how you deal with indigenous people 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.820
because there's so much conflict in this world 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.760
with indigenous people and companies.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.440
There's never going to be an end goal.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.060
There's never going to be a point where we get to that,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.270
we say OK we're done.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.760
We've achieved what we need to achieve. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.910
It's for the next twenty-one and a half years it's going to be an ongoing effort 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:35.260
[music]

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.920
[music fades out]

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.860
[truck revving]

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.700
[music]

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.360
I think we have an opportunity to create lasting employment opportunities for people.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.340
It's a common theme throughout all of our agreements,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.000
that we strive to maximize First Nation and Metis employment.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.200
[music]

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.540
This is Detour's main loading unit 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.980
So this is the shovel that loads out all the ore, waste rock,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.980
and everything else that comes with it.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.060
[music]

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.080
[truck revving]

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.640
[truck honk]

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.060
[construction noise]

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.780
It's one of the biggest shovel's they have in mining.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.500
So I think anybody who got opportunity to run a piece of equipment like this 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.920
should be pretty excited.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.160
I never thought I'd be running equipment like this when I got here.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.960
[music]

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.160
I'd say it was a good opportunity for long-term employment.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.480
They'll be here for a long time.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.800
So now it's a good opportunity for young people to come and start.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.620
[music]

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:53.380
[truck revving engine]

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.580
[honk, honk, honk]

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.180
[truck revving]

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.600
If you look over there you can see a yellow ribbon and a red ribbon coming down.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.440
So you can tell that he's in the high-grade block.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.160
And on this side I can't see my ribbons at all.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.620
So I have to go up there and refresh it,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.200
so that the shovel operator knows that he's digging.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.480
I heard that Detour was one of the better places to work at 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.840
when it comes to mines in the area.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.860
And I applied.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.180
I got an interview and based off the interview,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.900
I got the job.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
[quick radio beeps]

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.460
[truck honk]

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.340
It allows me to find an insight into the mining industry, 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.220
gain experience, gain knowledge,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.200
and figure out whether it's something I would enjoy doing.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.000
It allows me to make money and save money,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.680
so I would be able to go back to school.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.760
If I do go back to school in the mining industry,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.220
it would be for mining engineer.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.440
[music]

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.420
I enjoy it. I get along.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.260
Everyone's friendly 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.800
Once you're here for a certain amount of time you get to know everyone 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.400
and it's almost like family.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.280
We want to ensure that our aboriginal employees feel at home,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.580
that there's activities and facilities for them to use, 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.080
for all of our employees to use regardless of their background.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.080
We also want to share with our non-aboriginal employees 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.280
a bit of the history and traditions of our aboriginal partners.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.560
That's why we developed the cultural committee.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.320
But, we also have a recreational committee that we have too,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.460
where we're trying to get like construction camp, permanent camp, 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.900
like everybody on site to like have activities maybe once or twice a week.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.560
[music]

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.340
[four-wheeler engine]

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.360
It's great to work here because of the one week in and one week out is awesome.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.700
It's a good company to work for because it's so huge.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.680
There's so much different types of positions available.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.300
And yeah! And there is advancement that they can go on 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.340
and go further with their skills and career. 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:22.600
[music]

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.380
[plastic crinkling]

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.760
I like the fieldwork.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.720
I like to be in the nature.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.380
[plastic crinkling]

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.160
And plus I know that the job is working with the environment 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.400
and protecting our land, right.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.020
[Laughs]

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.900
When this mine is gone those people will still have those skills,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.930
and be able to go anywhere in this country or anywhere internationally and work.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.280
There's a lot to be done, a lot more learning for us 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.720
to know about the land on which we're working,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.560
about the people who inhabit it who will continue to use it 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.400
and will be here long after we're gone.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.080
We want to ensure that we meet all of those commitments 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.210
And there's many, many commitments that we've made 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.560
to ensure that this mine is built with the intent of leaving 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.420
a positive legacy for future generations.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:12.280
[music fades out]
