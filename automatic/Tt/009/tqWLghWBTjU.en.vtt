weird<00:01:35.500> with<00:01:36.039> that<00:01:36.159> big<00:01:36.340> window<00:01:36.579> in<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.850> back

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
weird with that big window in the back

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.330 
weird with that big window in the back
but<00:01:37.899> then<00:01:38.140> again<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.590> might<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.039> take<00:01:39.159> it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
but then again you might be to take it

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.590 
but then again you might be to take it
to<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> senseless<00:01:39.700> customs<00:01:39.880> get<00:01:40.390> rid<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.509> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
window and see what it's like their

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.389 
window and see what it's like their
overall<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:44.259> vehicle<00:01:44.619> isn't<00:01:44.890> one<00:01:45.219> of<00:01:45.250> the

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
overall this vehicle isn't one of the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.999 
overall this vehicle isn't one of the
best<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:46.119> doesn't<00:01:46.509> handle<00:01:46.780> too<00:01:46.899> great<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.560> as

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
best it doesn't handle too great and as

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.639 
best it doesn't handle too great and as
I<00:01:48.219> said<00:01:48.280> before<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.759> doesn't<00:01:49.030> look<00:01:49.119> too<00:01:49.240> good

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
I said before it doesn't look too good

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.279 
I said before it doesn't look too good

but up next we have the BF that Biff der
this<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.520> was<00:01:54.700> most<00:01:55.119> anticipating

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
this is the one I was most anticipating

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.349 
this is the one I was most anticipating
it<00:01:56.170> looks<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.710> looks<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.189> part<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.579> ingame

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
it looks that looks the part and ingame

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.849 
it looks that looks the part and ingame
it<00:01:58.570> really<00:01:58.899> does<00:01:59.049> handle<00:01:59.409> as<00:01:59.499> you<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.679> see

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
it really does handle as you can see

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.770 
it really does handle as you can see
then<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.219> have<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.429> catch<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:00.999> just<00:02:01.030> might

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
then you have to catch it it just might

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.289 
then you have to catch it it just might
