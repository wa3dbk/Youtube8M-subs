that's<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.609> will<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.939> maybe<00:00:24.539> just

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that's it I think it will be maybe just

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.580 
that's it I think it will be maybe just
10<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.310> careful<00:00:27.230> 70<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
10 I think it will be very careful 70 I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
10 I think it will be very careful 70 I
think<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:31.369> mark<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> difficult<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> lot

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
think so mark is difficult because a lot

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.030 
think so mark is difficult because a lot
of<00:00:33.450> people<00:00:33.570> who<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.290> speak<00:00:34.530> Dutch<00:00:34.770> though

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
of people who can speak Dutch though

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410 
of people who can speak Dutch though
they<00:00:35.190> understand<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.760> by<00:00:35.940> saying<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
they understand what by saying in the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
they understand what by saying in the
field<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:36.930> need<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.350> careful<00:00:37.530> because

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
field so we need to be careful because

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.920
