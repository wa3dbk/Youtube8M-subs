about<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.130> bit<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.240> great

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
about in just a little bit the great

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
about in just a little bit the great
thing<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.899> smg's<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thing about the smg's is that it kind of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.950 
thing about the smg's is that it kind of
just<00:01:50.640> speeds<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> game<00:01:51.329> fear<00:01:51.720> because

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just speeds up the game fear because

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.980 
just speeds up the game fear because
you've<00:01:52.860> run<00:01:53.009> speeds<00:01:53.399> faster<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.570> aim<00:01:54.750> in

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you've run speeds faster your aim in

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.020 
you've run speeds faster your aim in
speeds<00:01:55.350> faster<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.340> bring<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.850> your

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
speeds faster when you bring up your

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
speeds faster when you bring up your
weapon<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.360> sprinting<00:01:57.990> faster<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
weapon from sprinting faster and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
weapon from sprinting faster and
everything's<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.570> faster<00:02:00.869> overall<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
everything's just just faster overall so

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
everything's just just faster overall so
it's<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.860> that's<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.670> great<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.840> spectrum

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's so that's really great the spectrum

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's so that's really great the spectrum
in<00:02:04.259> particular<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in particular it's one of the one of the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.589 
in particular it's one of the one of the
better<00:02:05.899> smg's<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.970> fast<00:02:09.209> sense

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
better smg's it's got a very fast sense

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.900 
better smg's it's got a very fast sense
speed<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> recoil<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:10.739> low<00:02:11.129> even

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
speed so the recoil is very low even

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.880 
speed so the recoil is very low even
though<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.959> one<00:02:13.080> higher<00:02:13.319> fire<00:02:13.620> rates

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
though it's got to one higher fire rates

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
though it's got to one higher fire rates
usually<00:02:14.310> fine<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.000> higher<00:02:15.180> fire<00:02:15.450> rate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
usually fine with higher fire rate

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
usually fine with higher fire rate
weapons<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.440> fire<00:02:16.620> rate<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.310> too<00:02:17.520> fast<00:02:17.819> for

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
weapons at the fire rate is too fast for

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.610 
weapons at the fire rate is too fast for
the<00:02:18.180> %<00:02:18.989> speed<00:02:19.730> high<00:02:20.730> recoil<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.959> spectra

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the % speed high recoil but the spectra

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.400 
the % speed high recoil but the spectra
is<00:02:22.680> pretty<00:02:22.860> good<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.610> also<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:24.110> ok<00:02:25.110> iron

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
is pretty good it's also got ok iron

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.800 
is pretty good it's also got ok iron
sights<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.819> actually<00:02:27.120> see<00:02:27.450> where<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
sights you can actually see where you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
sights you can actually see where you
shoot<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.170> unlike<00:02:28.470> other<00:02:28.800> weapons<00:02:29.129> not<00:02:29.280> be

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
shoot it unlike other weapons not be

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.420 
shoot it unlike other weapons not be
losing<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.650> overall<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.769> got<00:02:31.860> some<00:02:32.099> some

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
losing and overall it's got some some

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.860 
losing and overall it's got some some
great<00:02:32.550> attachments<00:02:33.209> which<00:02:33.480> I'll<00:02:33.660> talk<00:02:33.810> about

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
great attachments which I'll talk about

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.199 
great attachments which I'll talk about
in<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.500> bit<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:35.580> best<00:02:35.760> attachment

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
in just a little bit the best attachment

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
in just a little bit the best attachment
I<00:02:36.269> think<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> definitely<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.470> rapid<00:02:37.800> fire

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
I think is definitely the rapid fire

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.740 
I think is definitely the rapid fire
attachment<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.760> will<00:02:38.849> increase<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.480> fire

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
attachment that will increase that fire

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
attachment that will increase that fire
rate<00:02:39.959> from<00:02:40.230> nine<00:02:40.470> hundred<00:02:40.769> thirty<00:02:40.950> seven

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
rate from nine hundred thirty seven

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.920 
rate from nine hundred thirty seven
point<00:02:41.519> five<00:02:41.730> rounds<00:02:42.269> per<00:02:42.330> minute<00:02:42.480> which<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
point five rounds per minute which is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.850 
point five rounds per minute which is
fast<00:02:43.650> anyway<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.720> 1250<00:02:45.720> which<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.319> insane

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
fast anyway up to 1250 which is insane

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640 
fast anyway up to 1250 which is insane
it<00:02:47.819> takes<00:02:48.420> people<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.840> within<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.349> split

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it takes people that within a split

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.130 
it takes people that within a split
second<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.360> let's<00:02:51.510> take<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.660> look<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:51.959> some

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
second so let's take a look at some

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.170 
second so let's take a look at some
recommended<00:02:52.680> perks<00:02:52.950> first<00:02:53.580> up<00:02:53.730> we've<00:02:53.849> got<00:02:53.879> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
recommended perks first up we've got the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
recommended perks first up we've got the
scavenger<00:02:54.629> perk<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.080> if<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.410> do<00:02:55.560> run<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
scavenger perk now if you do run the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.979 
scavenger perk now if you do run the
rapid<00:02:56.610> fire<00:02:56.790> attachment<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.480> definitely

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
rapid fire attachment you definitely

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.780 
rapid fire attachment you definitely
need<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.230> run<00:02:58.379> scavenger<00:02:58.950> alongside<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
need to run scavenger alongside it

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.570 
need to run scavenger alongside it
you'll<00:02:59.909> soon<00:03:00.120> run<00:03:00.390> run<00:03:01.050> through<00:03:01.260> your<00:03:01.580> your

you'll soon run run through your your
ammunition<00:03:02.909> supply<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.050> scavenger<00:03:04.620> helps

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
ammunition supply so scavenger helps

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.000 
ammunition supply so scavenger helps
resupply<00:03:05.489> off<00:03:05.790> dead<00:03:06.030> bodies<00:03:06.450> also<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.830> the

with the rapid fire attachment you want
to<00:03:09.900> equip<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.349> sleight<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.620> hand<00:03:10.980> poke

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
to equip this sleight of hand poke

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.699 
to equip this sleight of hand poke
you'll<00:03:12.090> place<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.360> magazine<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.080> no<00:03:13.200> time<00:03:13.470> so

you'll place the magazine in no time so
slightly<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> helps<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.670> were<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.750> just

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
slightly and helps you were it just

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.390 
slightly and helps you were it just
state<00:03:16.200> replenish<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.800> magazine<00:03:17.129> at

marathon peg with smg's you want to wait

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.470 
marathon peg with smg's you want to wait
just<00:03:22.409> go<00:03:22.680> sprinting<00:03:23.159> around<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.370> map<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.790> get

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
just go sprinting around the map and get

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.300 
just go sprinting around the map and get
up<00:03:24.569> close<00:03:24.599> with<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.110> bad<00:03:25.260> guys<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.769> marathan

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
up close with the bad guys so marathan

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.430 
up close with the bad guys so marathan
helps<00:03:26.640> cut<00:03:27.510> out<00:03:27.659> those<00:03:27.840> delays<00:03:28.200> between

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
helps cut out those delays between

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.009 
helps cut out those delays between
sprinting<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:29.690> sprint<00:03:30.690> all<00:03:30.900> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
sprinting that's you just sprint all the

the rapid fire attack finish folded the
best<00:03:36.569> attachment<00:03:37.140> for<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.349> spectra<00:03:37.799> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
best attachment for the spectra it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.500 
best attachment for the spectra it
doesn't<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.610> affect<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.030> tree<00:03:39.150> car<00:03:39.330> too

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
doesn't really affect the tree car too

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.809 
doesn't really affect the tree car too
much<00:03:39.720> because<00:03:39.930> of<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.170> fast<00:03:41.099> descent<00:03:41.489> speed

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
much because of the fast descent speed

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.020 
much because of the fast descent speed
and<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.150> really<00:03:42.780> does<00:03:42.959> decrease<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.860> time<00:03:44.849> to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and it really does decrease the time to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.449 
and it really does decrease the time to
kill<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.420> makes<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:46.290> very<00:03:46.769> deadly<00:03:47.040> weapon

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
kill it makes it a very deadly weapon

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.880 
kill it makes it a very deadly weapon
and<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:48.060> takes<00:03:48.269> people<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.230> no<00:03:49.409> time

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
attach the grip attachment and see how

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.470 
attach the grip attachment and see how
you<00:04:32.910> go<00:04:33.150> then

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
you go then

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.780 
you go then
it's<00:04:34.230> also<00:04:34.380> worth<00:04:35.010> bearing<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.400> mind<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.730> you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
it's also worth bearing in mind that you

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.730 
it's also worth bearing in mind that you
can<00:04:35.970> attach<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.510> rapid<00:04:36.840> fire<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.260> grip

can attach the rapid fire and grip

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.650 
can attach the rapid fire and grip
attachment<00:04:38.250> at<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.640> same<00:04:38.820> time<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.420> you've

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
attachment at the same time so you've

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.360 
attachment at the same time so you've
got<00:04:39.840> clearly<00:04:40.080> best<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.620> higher<00:04:41.010> fire<00:04:41.310> rate

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
got clearly best of a higher fire rate

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.780 
got clearly best of a higher fire rate
and<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.420> lower<00:04:42.450> recoil<00:04:43.100> along<00:04:44.100> with<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
and the lower recoil along with the the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.250 
and the lower recoil along with the the
wall<00:04:44.970> water<00:04:45.150> boat<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:45.810> definitely<00:04:45.990> a

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
wall water boat so that's definitely a

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.160 
wall water boat so that's definitely a
class<00:04:46.920> worth<00:04:47.160> trained<00:04:47.430> out<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.420> whatsoever<00:04:48.990> I

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
class worth trained out so whatsoever I

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.710 
class worth trained out so whatsoever I
see<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.650> great<00:04:49.770> fun<00:04:50.130> fun<00:04:50.610> cost<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.510> use
