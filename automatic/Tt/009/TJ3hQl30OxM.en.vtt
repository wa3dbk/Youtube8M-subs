00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.650
 hello everyone here we are showing 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.040
 How do you solve a problem in the main 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.040
 craft 1.7 good the error is that 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.470
 when we open in minecraft 1.7 it's like 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.380
 that the game screen is divided 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.930
 in one half it is black and the other one is 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.230
 the game and good here I bring you how 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.170
 fix it good to start I'm going to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.660
 show example this is what we 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.320
 shows is not this advantage as they see that 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.810
 is divided but if we do this here 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.790
 It looks black like I said, well I know 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.150
 how to solve it well let's get it out 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.710
 and we are going to minecraft in my case it will be in 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.710
 my case is the pirate launcher 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.890
 Y 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.760
 while loading this I'm going to pass 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.530
 good once open launcher what 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 we have to do is we put these 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.020
 edith profile edit profile 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 ready and this does not come out not our 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.550
 resolution and what we have to do is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 this 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:36.260
 we put 1024 x 600 we put profile or 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.690
 profile as you say and we play 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.640
 and now see what is going to happen to the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.640
 change over that tiny 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.430
 good part miren 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.430
 ruined that it was as it looks now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's load it 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.930
 I'm being charged 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.069
 and hey , it's going to come out 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.160
 well as it is arranged and we fixed the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.050
 problem is this simplicity what had 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.050
 what to change I had I do not know how three 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.319
 months trying to fix it until 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.319
 I knew how to do it and dad fix it 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.090
 well, it makes me not answer minecraft 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.370
 but good if in my case it was fixed but 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.100
 It still has some twists but 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.590
 matter the game is perfect everything goes 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.960
 perfect and good was not just show up is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.840

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.580
 and some that should be few and good 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.160
