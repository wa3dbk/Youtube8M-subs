00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.819 
guess they figured that since the male
is<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.610> minority<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.450> field<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.439> he<00:01:46.649> has

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
is the minority in the field then he has

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.800 
people know how much you're taking home
because<00:03:30.000> something<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.449> that<00:03:30.629> could<00:03:30.750> happen

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
because something like that could happen

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.420 
because something like that could happen
so<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.349> guess<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:32.069> minor<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.120> minor<00:03:33.180> dispute

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
so I guess like a minor a minor dispute

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.039 
so I guess like a minor a minor dispute
happen<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.389> wasn't<00:03:36.780> said<00:03:36.900> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
happen because the one wasn't said that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.930 
happen because the one wasn't said that
the<00:03:37.139> man<00:03:37.349> was<00:03:37.590> making<00:03:37.980> more<00:03:38.159> than<00:03:38.190> her<00:03:38.430> they

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
the man was making more than her they

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.930 
the man was making more than her they
paid<00:03:39.239> me<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.599> mover<00:03:40.010> because<00:03:41.010> they<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.519> a

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
paid me and mover because they are a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.990 
paid me and mover because they are a
minority<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.379> field<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.979> it<00:03:44.099> just<00:03:44.129> lets

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
minority in the field and it just lets

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.670 
minority in the field and it just lets
it<00:03:45.120> plain<00:03:45.479> and<00:03:45.629> simple<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:45.989> if<00:03:46.290> your<00:03:46.409> man<00:03:46.650> out
