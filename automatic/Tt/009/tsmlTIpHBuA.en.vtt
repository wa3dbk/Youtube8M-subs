00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.779 
you to create a lot of force going
across<00:01:45.899> your<00:01:46.259> body<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.039> would<00:01:47.340> say<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
across your body now I would say this is

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.399 
across your body now I would say this is
more<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.119> advanced<00:01:48.539> stroke<00:01:48.929> if<00:01:49.259> you're

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
more of an advanced stroke if you're

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.349 
more of an advanced stroke if you're
just<00:01:49.619> starting<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.159> game<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.789> probably<00:01:50.969> want

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
just starting the game you probably want

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.419 
just starting the game you probably want
to<00:01:51.420> go<00:01:51.539> more<00:01:51.810> low<00:01:52.109> to<00:01:52.170> high<00:01:52.469> with<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
to go more low to high with it but I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.099 
to go more low to high with it but I
really<00:01:53.789> feel<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> generate

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
really feel like if you want to generate

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.080 
really feel like if you want to generate
a<00:01:55.320> world-class<00:01:55.890> back<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.729> hit<00:01:56.820> great

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
a world-class back in and hit great

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.450 
a world-class back in and hit great
backhands<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.320> practice<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:59.009> type<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
backhands you can practice this type of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.020 
backhands you can practice this type of
swing<00:01:59.820> where<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.539> go<00:02:00.749> across<00:02:01.109> your<00:02:01.350> body

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.719 

you'll<00:02:07.030> also<00:02:07.240> notice<00:02:07.770> again<00:02:08.770> at<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> very<00:02:09.009> end

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
you'll also notice again at the very end

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.330 
you'll also notice again at the very end
look<00:02:09.910> at<00:02:10.030> my<00:02:10.149> relaxed<00:02:10.720> hand<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:12.100> just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
look at my relaxed hand here this just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.510 
look at my relaxed hand here this just
allows<00:02:12.819> me<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.750> use<00:02:13.959> my<00:02:14.200> non-dominant<00:02:14.830> arm<00:02:15.250> to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
allows me to use my non-dominant arm to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.300 
allows me to use my non-dominant arm to
swing<00:02:15.670> across<00:02:16.090> I'm<00:02:16.900> not<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> big<00:02:17.380> fan<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.709> just

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
swing across I'm not a big fan of just

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.100 
swing across I'm not a big fan of just
swinging<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.480> hand<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.959> learn

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
swinging with you know one hand to learn

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.140 
swinging with you know one hand to learn
how<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.319> use<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.740> non-dominant<00:02:21.340> hand<00:02:21.580> arm<00:02:21.820> I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
how to use the non-dominant hand arm I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.730 
how to use the non-dominant hand arm I
really<00:02:22.630> think<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.930> should<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.230> two<00:02:23.440> hands

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
really think you should have two hands

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
really think you should have two hands
on<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.890> racket<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> make<00:02:25.090> sure<00:02:25.270> you're

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
on the racket but to make sure you're

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.940 
on the racket but to make sure you're
using<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.840> non-dominant<00:02:26.260> arm<00:02:26.560> you're<00:02:26.830> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
using the non-dominant arm you're just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.070 
using the non-dominant arm you're just
going<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.160> be<00:02:27.220> relaxing<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:27.850> hand<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.870> let<00:02:28.990> me

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080
