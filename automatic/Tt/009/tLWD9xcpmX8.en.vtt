camera like this so the famous thing
about<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> clamshell<00:00:34.380> design<00:00:34.469> which

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
about it is as a clamshell design which

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.020 
about it is as a clamshell design which
means<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> open<00:00:35.640> the

do you set your ISO you're going to open

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.540 
do you set your ISO you're going to open
the<00:00:40.170> clamshell<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.860> play<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the clamshell and just play with this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
the clamshell and just play with this
knob<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.719> goes<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.020> 25<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.680> 800

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
knob right here it goes from 25 to 800

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
knob right here it goes from 25 to 800
which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.399> pretty<00:00:44.579> good<00:00:44.789> range<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.750> flash<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
which is pretty good range the flash a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.760 
which is pretty good range the flash a
little<00:00:47.129> knob<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:48.289> it's<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> X

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
little knob right there it's for the X

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.459 
little knob right there it's for the X
11<00:00:50.160> flash<00:00:50.309> attachment<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.050> don't

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
11 flash attachment I had that but don't

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
11 flash attachment I had that but don't
have<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.820> about<00:00:53.910> focusing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
have on this so what about focusing

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
have on this so what about focusing
focusing<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:55.020> preset<00:00:55.500> 3<00:00:55.860> determined<00:00:56.280> levels

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
focusing is preset 3 determined levels

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.160 
focusing is preset 3 determined levels
the<00:00:57.149> bottom<00:00:57.449> level<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.690> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the bottom level is going to be the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
the bottom level is going to be the
close-up<00:00:58.649> level<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> arrow

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
close-up level you have to get the arrow

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
close-up level you have to get the arrow
below<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.600> close-up<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.739> meter<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
below it close-up is about one meter to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.030 
below it close-up is about one meter to
1.5<00:01:02.760> meters<00:01:03.170> kind<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> useful<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.650> close<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
1.5 meters kind of useful for close up

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.120 
1.5 meters kind of useful for close up
settings<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.210> next<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.689> infinity<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
settings the next is infinity so this is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.030 
settings the next is infinity so this is
a<00:01:08.159> long<00:01:08.729> distance<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.780> 2.5<00:01:10.439> meters<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a long distance about 2.5 meters to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
a long distance about 2.5 meters to
infinity<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:12.930> they're<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
infinity and the one they're going to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.359 
infinity and the one they're going to
have<00:01:13.350> your<00:01:13.470> camera<00:01:13.680> probably<00:01:13.950> most<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> time

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
have your camera probably most the time

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.999 
have your camera probably most the time
is<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.850> middle<00:01:15.180> setting<00:01:15.500> 1.2<00:01:16.500> meters<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
is this middle setting 1.2 meters to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.710 
is this middle setting 1.2 meters to
infinity<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.450> leave<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
infinity so you can just leave it on

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.719 
infinity so you can just leave it on
here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.080> shoot<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> should<00:01:20.580> be

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here and just shoot with this should be

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.719 
here and just shoot with this should be
able<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> take<00:01:21.090> care<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> most<00:01:21.450> situations<00:01:22.729> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
able to take care of most situations so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.620 
able to take care of most situations so

trouble with it so I'll fast forward a
bit<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.229> when<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.460> there<00:01:53.549> as

the last function on this camera there's
two<00:02:44.660> things<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.050> bottom

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
two things on the bottom

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.440 
two things on the bottom
I<00:02:45.470> should<00:02:45.710> probably<00:02:45.800> address<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
I should probably address and it is a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.000 
I should probably address and it is a
battery<00:02:47.900> check<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> check<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> battery<00:02:48.860> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
battery check to check a battery and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.450 
battery check to check a battery and
then<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> self<00:02:49.430> timer<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:52.070> that's<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.340> with

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
then a self timer so so that's it with

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.010 
then a self timer so so that's it with
this<00:02:52.520> camera<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.450> great<00:02:53.780> point

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
this camera it's a really great point

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.540 
this camera it's a really great point
shoot<00:02:54.350> one<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> more<00:02:54.800> famous<00:02:54.950> ones<00:02:55.160> I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
shoot one of the more famous ones I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.460 
shoot one of the more famous ones I
think<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.390> price<00:02:56.600> between<00:02:56.810> twenty<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.320> thirty

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
think a price between twenty and thirty

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.490 
think a price between twenty and thirty
dollars<00:02:57.770> is<00:02:58.040> really<00:02:58.070> good
