Serato<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.380> will<00:02:58.470> automatically

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
Serato in it that will automatically

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.400 
Serato in it that will automatically
populate<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.760> my<00:03:00.000> DJ<00:03:00.300> music<00:03:00.690> into<00:03:01.320> this

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
populate all my DJ music into this

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.280 
populate all my DJ music into this
playlist<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.850> let's<00:03:03.060> look<00:03:03.270> at<00:03:03.480> BPM<00:03:04.080> for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
playlist so let's look at BPM for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.540 
playlist so let's look at BPM for
instance<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.720> saying<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.250> pull<00:03:08.250> all

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
instance so this is saying that pull all

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.900 
instance so this is saying that pull all
the<00:03:08.820> songs<00:03:09.060> from<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> playlist<00:03:09.900> all<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the songs from the playlist all and the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.110 
the songs from the playlist all and the
BPM<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> range<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.290> 50<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.710> 65<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.910> this

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
BPM is in the range of 50 to 65 so this

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.750 
BPM is in the range of 50 to 65 so this
is<00:03:15.240> all<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.630> slower<00:03:15.930> kind<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.350> music<00:03:16.680> from<00:03:17.340> 50

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
is all the slower kind of music from 50

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.080 
is all the slower kind of music from 50
to<00:03:17.850> 65<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.920> will<00:03:20.010> always<00:03:20.220> live<00:03:20.700> update

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
to 65 and it will always live update

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.810 
to 65 and it will always live update
that's<00:03:21.330> why<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.540> box<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.080> checked<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:23.250> let's

there you go it populates in this
playlist<00:04:14.319> as<00:04:14.440> well<00:04:14.470> notice<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.550> didn't<00:04:15.790> have<00:04:15.880> to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
playlist as well notice I didn't have to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.849 
playlist as well notice I didn't have to
add<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.600> any<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:17.139> these<00:04:17.260> other<00:04:17.470> playlists

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
add it to any of these other playlists

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.099 
add it to any of these other playlists
they<00:04:18.070> automatically<00:04:18.639> populate<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:19.989> is

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
they automatically populate and this is

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.960 
they automatically populate and this is
why<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.290> think<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.859> organization<00:04:21.579> style<00:04:21.820> is

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
why I think this organization style is

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.400 
why I think this organization style is
so<00:04:22.450> much<00:04:22.960> easier<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:24.040> maintain<00:04:24.660> because<00:04:25.660> you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
so much easier to maintain because you

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.740 
so much easier to maintain because you
don't<00:04:26.560> have<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.800> worry<00:04:26.980> about<00:04:27.600> making<00:04:28.600> sure

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
don't have to worry about making sure

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.420 
don't have to worry about making sure
