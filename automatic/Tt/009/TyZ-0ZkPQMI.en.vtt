00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.160
 a new environment and I would like you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.059
 like to ask about how do you like each other 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.530
 Write that down in the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.610
 comment box I would be there 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.290
 Huge about it 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.049
 yes and now we come to the main topic 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.900
 I have been running for some time now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.190
 for mum what is he ran into ran them 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.750
 is a trace 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.550
 which, for example, after the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.230
 laundry or in the dry hair 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.100
 sprays and that will not work anymore 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 washed out 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.440
 She takes care of your hair and approaches yours 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.949
 hair it against so this dry 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.750
 Liquid and is out of my hair care 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.280
 Routine is an essential part of life 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.050
 you can go to the store and get yourself 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.269
 a buy there is a lot of alcohol 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.859
 usually not something for the hair 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.230
 is necessarily good and therefore wants 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.030
 I use the same otherwise has the first 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 Effect that it is much cheaper if 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 I myself to myself and secondly 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.159
 the ingredients say my hair to me 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 I know what my hair is for a hair cure 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.699
 then what do you like from flushing then 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.829
 i can do with these ingredients easily 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.390
 ever work so it's almost on 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.040
 Tailored me and how that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.350
 I would like to work with you now 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
 tell about this ran in need 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 we have three ingredients we need water 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 we need oil and we need one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 hak or a hair conditioner that stays 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.350
 let you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
 I have a hair cure 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.040
 somehow it is not decided 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.690
 big in terms of pollutants in it is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.420
 Everything is kept very natural that is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.130
 me very important it smells like banana 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.680
 and that is totally wonderful I do 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.300
 that now off 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.300
 then I have such an oil for hair here 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.010
 is just so rose oil almond oil coconut oil 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.330
 I would use that for the hair 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.970
 that in the case is now one 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.880
 wild roses facial oil but I too 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.230
 like the hair suppose because it is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.610
 that's in such a pipette that's whole 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.320
 practically there I can do that directly 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 otherwise you can dose 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.400
 just flip it over 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.860
 and I have a spray bottle before because 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.900
 was formally in and out of sight 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.480
 I throw something away because the atomizer 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.010
 totally great that I have already 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.870
 Water is not made by the way water 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.340
 do you need that is also totally 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.930
 Great and that's why I thought so 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.460
 clearly thrown further 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.840
 used for sea running 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.330
 yes I have now this is such a small one 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 vial that is 100 milliliters 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 strong now I just do two times 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.370
 drops of oil or 3 I'll take a look 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 two okay i do a third i have 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.060
 Three drops of oil are packed in here now 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.410
 i use my great knife it could 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.460
 but also with the fingers make mine 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 knife it is smooth somehow 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.380
 bit more comfortable now taking 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.100
 something like to have lots of 100 milliliter 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.320
 and smear me now in here 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
 the opening, of course, is very but 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:54.450
 this works out 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:57.570
 that has and then he puts his head 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.459
 on it again and it must be completely quite 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.310
 vigorously shake and I'm 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.380
 By the way, by the way, it's good if you 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.030
 warm water used to mix that 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.320
 ran in does not always have to be warm when 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.120
 you use it lubricate you into the hair 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.300
 one mission then the ingredients dissolve 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.300
 easy 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.320
 Now I have that ready for me and 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.520
 I'll check everything first 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.780
 has dissolved here can crumble islands 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.510
 looks very good and it smells too 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.740
 Well , how do I wear it? I take it 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.450
 Now all hair aside 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.250
 and brittle you do not have to watch out 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.840
 import the approach then you have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.490
 her greasy hair very fast 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.650
 I've always been there like that under the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.530
 earlobes just and there I start 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:52.209
 then sprinkle a little differently 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:59.560
 when the tips knead it that way 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:01.360
 a little bit and then what about 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.950
 I sleep at night or before going to bed 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.020
 I always make me plait to 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 sleep and braid and then speak 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.920
 then also always pure you look at 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.930
 next day totally supple and choose 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.340
 when I open it then you do it 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.230
 Have you ever had a life? 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.269

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.859

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.470
