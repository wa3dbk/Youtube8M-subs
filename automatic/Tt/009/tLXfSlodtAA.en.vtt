finally doing the review took me a while

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.769 
finally doing the review took me a while
but<00:00:17.520> let's<00:00:17.699> start<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> cable<00:00:18.600> right

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
but let's start with the cable right

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.439 
but let's start with the cable right
here<00:00:18.980> it's<00:00:19.980> pretty<00:00:20.220> simple<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:20.970> tangle

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
here it's pretty simple it's not tangle

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.080 
here it's pretty simple it's not tangle
free<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> put<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.820> your<00:00:23.910> pocket

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
free so if you put this in your pocket

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.070 
free so if you put this in your pocket
or<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> bag<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.320> get<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.769> tangled<00:00:26.070> up

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
or a bag it will get pretty tangled up

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.150 
or a bag it will get pretty tangled up
that's<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.590> didn't<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:28.980> like

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
that's one thing I didn't really like

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.460 
that's one thing I didn't really like
about<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> price<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> 20

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
about it but for the price which is 20

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.120 
about it but for the price which is 20
dollars<00:00:31.850> these<00:00:32.850> headphones<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.480> come<00:00:34.130> with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
dollars these headphones do come with

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
dollars these headphones do come with
pretty<00:00:35.309> good<00:00:35.520> quality<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> lot

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
pretty good quality there are a lot

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
pretty good quality there are a lot
better<00:00:37.110> than<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> Apple<00:00:37.829> normal<00:00:38.399> headphones

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
better than the Apple normal headphones

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.319 
better than the Apple normal headphones
so<00:00:39.110> that's<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.379> good<00:00:40.940> but<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.270> see

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so that's pretty good but as you can see

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
so that's pretty good but as you can see
here<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:43.500> getting<00:00:43.920> tangled<00:00:44.160> just

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
here it's gonna get getting tangled just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
here it's gonna get getting tangled just
by<00:00:44.910> me<00:00:45.059> holding<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.629> my<00:00:45.660> hands<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
by me holding it in my hands and the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.709 
by me holding it in my hands and the
cable<00:00:47.070> does<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.610> straight<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
cable does not go straight because of

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.700 
cable does not go straight because of
the<00:00:48.960> way<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:50.100> came<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> package<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the way that it came in the package but

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.689 
the way that it came in the package but
3.5<00:00:52.710> millimeter<00:00:53.190> jack

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
3.5 millimeter jack

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.319 
3.5 millimeter jack
plug<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.020> mp3<00:00:55.440> player<00:00:55.680> or

plug it in to your mp3 player or

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
plug it in to your mp3 player or
computer<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.480> anything<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.469> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
computer or anything like that that you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.119 
computer or anything like that that you
would<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.820> use<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
would like to use it with this one is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
would like to use it with this one is
not<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> mic<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> where<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> mic

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
not the mic so this is where the mic

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.890 
not the mic so this is where the mic
would<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.559> guessing<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.750> mine

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
would be I'm guessing but now for mine

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
would be I'm guessing but now for mine
it<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> random<00:01:08.159> thing<00:01:08.369> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it just has that random thing that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.929 
it just has that random thing that
doesn't<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.360> any<00:01:10.049> purpose<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.939> with

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
doesn't have any purpose at all with

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
doesn't have any purpose at all with
this<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:13.260> course<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this you can of course put the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
this you can of course put the
headphones<00:01:14.400> closer<00:01:14.880> together<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.689> case

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
headphones closer together just in case

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.330 
headphones closer together just in case
that's<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that's what you want and then the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's what you want and then the
headphones<00:01:20.729> itself<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> metallic<00:01:21.689> blue<00:01:21.930> which

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
headphones itself is metallic blue which

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
headphones itself is metallic blue which
I<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> color<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.640> color<00:01:23.790> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
I really like the color that color is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.020 
I really like the color that color is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
amazing I actually really like the way

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.499 
amazing I actually really like the way
it<00:01:27.060> turned<00:01:27.330> out<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.850> build<00:01:30.090> quality<00:01:30.150> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it turned out and the build quality is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
it turned out and the build quality is
pretty<00:01:30.810> good<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.920> sounds<00:01:32.369> pretty<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.790> like

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I said already the cables I connect to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
I said already the cables I connect to
the<00:01:35.009> headphones<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.729> small<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the headphones is pretty small which is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.660 
the headphones is pretty small which is
one<00:01:37.619> thing<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.860> didn't<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
one thing I didn't really like because I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
one thing I didn't really like because I
feel<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:40.020> durable<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
feel like it's not very durable but it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.450 
feel like it's not very durable but it
happens<00:01:41.990> another<00:01:42.990> thing<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.439> where<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
happens another thing is that where it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
happens another thing is that where it
says<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> left<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:46.649> pretty

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
says the left and the right it's pretty

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
says the left and the right it's pretty
small<00:01:47.040> autumn<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.670> see<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
small autumn if you can see here but it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.950 
small autumn if you can see here but it
is<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.530> small<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:51.149> gets<00:01:51.540> really

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is really small and it gets really

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.730

really<00:01:52.200> annoying<00:01:53.689> half<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> time<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.439> was

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
really annoying half the time I was

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.260 
really annoying half the time I was
trying<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.040> figure<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.399> which<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> left

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
trying to figure out which was the left

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
trying to figure out which was the left
and<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.670> took<00:01:59.820> me

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and which was the right and they took me

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
and which was the right and they took me
a<00:02:00.030> while<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.570> realize<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a while to actually realize and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050 
a while to actually realize and
sometimes<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.430> even<00:02:02.670> wearing<00:02:02.850> them

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
sometimes I was even wearing them

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.660 
sometimes I was even wearing them
backwards<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> most<00:02:05.159> people<00:02:05.430> don't<00:02:05.520> really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
backwards so most people don't really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340 
backwards so most people don't really
care<00:02:05.939> about<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.509> mean<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
care about that I mean there's not a

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.540 
care about that I mean there's not a
really<00:02:07.560> difference<00:02:07.979> between<00:02:08.280> songs

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
really difference between songs

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
sometimes where the left and the right

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.010 
sometimes where the left and the right
is<00:02:11.069> different<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> couple<00:02:12.900> songs

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
