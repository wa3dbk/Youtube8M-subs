00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello my name is Rossi and we will 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.919
 Today you test what you can do with 5 k dragon 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 Coins on dragon city gets chemistry 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:17.699
 sit down to the campfire sing the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:19.820
 campfire song that lg ef watch hello and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.410
 Welcome to metin2 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 de vita or mors no idea but on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 In any case, I thought the beta 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 is still there and you have 5k kites 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 coins in item shop and there this beta 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.760
 stop by the gameforge and that then 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 also a bit representative of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 I have the official server 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.350
 we thought we'll just try it there 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 Free kites to the item shop have something 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.690
 one so with 5 kg on kites already as 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 he gets my five card he is 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 a lot 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 but we also know that they turn stone 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.180
 alchemy is an asshole is the knowledge 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.970
 also accept that and that has got loose 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.280
 lasted over 20 minutes 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.950
 I had taken that anyway 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.860
 so without commenting and so it has 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.409
 Shut up before and after 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.390
 little comment 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.299
 unfortunately unfortunately the language is me 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.770
 Recording then packaged and must 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.060
 comment now but that is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.509
 yes loose flaky I know 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.000
 honestly not at all how many cordes 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.860
 that were in effect because he is yes 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 open to my eyes 25 and so on 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 and yes, but are really 5 kg 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.790
 instructed and data in any case one 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.150
 caused by tendonitis 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.590
 at least felt but I guess 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.729
 that it really is very interesting 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 see and yes you write the counter 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 what you think about our tests 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.050
 is of course not representative now 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.340
 generally could be due to extreme 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.300
 but luck could have been that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.650
 I have extreme bad luck until the end 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.390
 watch and yes I thought if I 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.160
 you go here so he's the one 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.470
 even if it stops only beta 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.600
 But you know what you mean 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.430
 then you can indeed about the general 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.520
 topic item-shop talk yes is general 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.580
 yes, with many people such a fixed topic 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.430
 yes you only achieve something with item shop 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:50.019
 or pay to win or something else 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.940
 that's not true the metin2 really as 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:58.720
 or what moment I have everything 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:01.420
 prepared ok i find myself in 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.260
 Two media does not agree with me 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.080
 play without your own money 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.519
 but that's honest 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.170
 only said it because I shut 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.620
 I have financial options 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.810
 my opinion is to be with the two 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.130
 hobby like gaming in general 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.110
 and a hobby because what cost and there is 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.690
 then stop no question how much or 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.300
 Otherwise, but if it is a hobby 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.300
 and you have the money left of course 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.640
 something other than if you look 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.319
 somehow in zugzwang feels that one 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.730
 necessarily have to spend money then has 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.080
 like gameforge but nothing to do with it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:46.760
 but the person himself so only once 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.590
 by the way but as I said in the metier 2 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.530
 There is something like the coupons 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.780
 More and more things are becoming tradable 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.480
 which I personally welcome 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.280
 because that's how people get the one 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 a little more item-shop want more 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.269
 item-shop and the people ours 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.599
 want to play our games 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.580
 So I think so would the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.280
 maybe gameforge again 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.920
 make a little more profit why they do it 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.209
 I do not know, but I think 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.489
 that would once and for many others that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.010
 make a little more lucrative but that is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.700
 not our thing we want to discuss 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.580
 pagewizz or not i say i 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.220
 claim of me I can already top 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.360
 play along 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.880
 even if I do not bomb it now 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.740
 but I have equipment when I play 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 that would be quite the case 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.710
 look different 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.570
 and yes, I think you can 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.490
 reach a lot even if you now with 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.300
 be fram be his dr and zu or 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.190
 you can now also super price 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.410
 Things may be open to anybody this market 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.810
 done that is a there there bonis 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 finished rich and so on you can 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.910
 just for young and mark 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.370
 to buy 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.830
 and since you can not tell me since 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.990
 Metin2 is only do if you are diligent 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.430
 then you can achieve a lot 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.560
 Of course, they presuppose that one 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.990
 then also experience from time to time and 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.500
 if you're just level 18 or somehow 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.180
 level 20 and then I complain yes 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.740
 take minutes for a level up metin2 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.800
 I really want to have an experience 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.139
 that's why he's sorry 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.599
 then you are just impatient and 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.050
 then metin2 just not your game 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:43.370
 because girl 2 is a game where you stop 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.979
 a little bit longer on a target 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.949
 working you have to see it that way 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.090
 the way to reach his goal 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.960
 metin 2 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.620
 that's the game and people's item 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.939
 shop reached this goal faster 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.110
 but then of course they get bored too 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.120
 more quickly 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.620
 i, for example, have great what i do 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.650
 super much I can improve 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.629
 and that's why I have another way to go 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.180
 I can still play this game a lot 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:15.300
 play better than others, for example 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:19.770
 and the people, the item shop reach 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.400
 the goal is faster and that's it 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.949
 actually already 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.870
 So you can item shop and that 's it 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.729
 perfectly okay i understand this 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.919
 frankly speaking, not so 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.839
 because in the end the people are not 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.860
 item shop and to the others say yes 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:41.569
 blah blah only item shop and stuff 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.430
 the people who pay it receive it 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.669
 the game quasi the gameforge leads 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.800
 Of course, these players only if it is 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.469
 That's why you have to prove that 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.030
 yes, let's see well always writes 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.919
 Your opinion in the comments will be me 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.550
 Definitely interested in what you think 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.719
 her from this format and so i test 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.879
 my 5k dr 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.340
 yes what came out now nothing 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.710
 or we can write werner 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.240
 how much you already put in there 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.219
 and what they got out and stuff 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.750
 but what you have to say can do that 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:15.460
 you drive yourself super 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.199
 I believe 15 pieces per day per account 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.750
 So there you can not complain 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.340
 that it is not there but well 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.840
 Write me your opinion in the 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.289
 Anyway , comments will be great 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.719
 looking forward 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:27.770
 and yes then what all of me social 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.960
 Media left you will find a video 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.860
 description I am out is one 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.860
 big funds ii
