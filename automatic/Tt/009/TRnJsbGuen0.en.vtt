in yeah I think the easiest thing about
boxing<00:03:18.939> is<00:03:19.090> getting<00:03:19.450> into<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> sport<00:03:20.230> getting

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
into the sport the hardest part is to

into the sport the hardest part is to
walk<00:03:23.319> away<00:03:23.530> leave<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.519> alone<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:25.659> have<00:03:26.079> to
