00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
a warm water wave it's almost more

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.370 
a warm water wave it's almost more
exciting<00:00:19.289> if<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.310> makes<00:00:20.520> any<00:00:20.640> sense

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200 

the<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> wind<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.910> waves

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the way the wind is and how the waves

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.140 
the way the wind is and how the waves
will<00:00:27.480> wrap<00:00:27.689> around<00:00:28.609> kind<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.760> fisherman

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
will wrap around kind of where fisherman

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.389 
will wrap around kind of where fisherman
Island<00:00:30.420> State<00:00:30.660> Park<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.949> usually<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
Island State Park is so we usually like

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.430

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to go out to Frankfurt as well but today

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
to go out to Frankfurt as well but today
I'd<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.890> bit<00:00:35.010> washed<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.579> over

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I'd be a little bit washed out over

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.240 
I'd be a little bit washed out over
there<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.350> clean<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.620> nicer<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> little

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
there so they clean up nicer a little

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770 
there so they clean up nicer a little
smaller<00:00:38.640> over<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.329> actually<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> little

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
smaller over here but actually a little

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
smaller over here but actually a little
bit<00:00:39.899> cleaner<00:00:40.170> almost<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.309> bit<00:00:41.430> more

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
bit cleaner almost a little bit more

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.110 
bit cleaner almost a little bit more
like<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:42.480> ocean<00:00:42.629> wave<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.879> some

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
like a like an ocean wave you get some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
like a like an ocean wave you get some
pretty<00:00:51.270> good<00:00:51.480> ice<00:00:51.960> cream<00:00:52.260> headaches<00:00:52.620> out

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty good ice cream headaches out

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.900 
pretty good ice cream headaches out
there<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> fall<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
there when you fall but it's this that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
there when you fall but it's this that
brief<00:00:57.360> adrenaline<00:00:58.170> rush<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.829> when

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
brief adrenaline rush that you get when

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
brief adrenaline rush that you get when
you're<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> wave<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.359> makes<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> worth

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you're on the wave that makes it worth

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.310 
you're on the wave that makes it worth
getting<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.559> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.430> hunt

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
getting out there kind of like the hunt

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.329 
getting out there kind of like the hunt
driving<00:01:04.320> around<00:01:04.470> looking<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> waves

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
driving around looking for the waves

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.090 
driving around looking for the waves
it's<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.450> part<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.320> makes<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> fun<00:01:07.860> for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's all part of what makes it fun for

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.929 
it's all part of what makes it fun for
