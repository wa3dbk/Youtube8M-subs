00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hello and welcome to a tutorial on craft

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.880 
hello and welcome to a tutorial on craft
will<00:00:02.580> toggle<00:00:02.760> areas<00:00:03.410> toggle<00:00:04.410> areas<00:00:04.740> are

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
will toggle areas toggle areas are

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.410 
will toggle areas toggle areas are
basically<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.310> system<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.940> allows<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
basically a system that allows you to

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.799 
basically a system that allows you to
set<00:00:06.839> two<00:00:07.500> areas<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.309> then<00:00:08.580> pull<00:00:09.150> two<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.599> more

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
set two areas and then pull two or more

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.650 
set two areas and then pull two or more
areas<00:00:10.110> or<00:00:11.099> even<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.210> toggle<00:00:12.540> between

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
areas or even one and toggle between

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.020 
areas or even one and toggle between
them<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.950> there's<00:00:14.130> only<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.460> area<00:00:14.670> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
them and if there's only one area it

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330 
them and if there's only one area it
also<00:00:15.120> toggles<00:00:15.570> between<00:00:15.660> blank<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.980> set<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
also toggles between blank you set the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
also toggles between blank you set the
area<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> well<00:00:18.060> guard<00:00:18.359> region<00:00:18.990> for

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
area with the well guard region for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000 
area with the well guard region for
example<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:22.170> little<00:00:22.380> gate<00:00:22.769> thing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
example this here this little gate thing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.640 
example this here this little gate thing
I've<00:00:23.160> made<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.180> type<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.449> slush<00:00:24.779> areas<00:00:25.350> space

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I've made if I type in slush areas space

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.870 
I've made if I type in slush areas space
say<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.750> then<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.019> name<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> area<00:00:28.740> say<00:00:29.189> G

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
say and then the name of the area say G

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
say and then the name of the area say G
open<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:32.329> then<00:00:33.329> yeah<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.930> press<00:00:34.200> ENTER<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
open and then yeah if I press ENTER it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.819 
open and then yeah if I press ENTER it
would<00:00:34.800> say<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.510> now<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> also<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
would say but now you can also use a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
would say but now you can also use a
system<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.550> namespaces<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.920> basically<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
system for namespaces which basically is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.619 
system for namespaces which basically is
the<00:00:42.829> folder<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.010> you're<00:00:44.309> saving<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the folder in which you're saving you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
the folder in which you're saving you
need<00:00:45.780> permission<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.590> access<00:00:46.770> any<00:00:47.280> namespace

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
need permission to access any namespace

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.000 
need permission to access any namespace
apart<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> default<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.829> your

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
apart from the default one which is your

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.180 
apart from the default one which is your
username<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.879> name<00:00:51.680> until<00:00:52.680> though<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.039> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
username with name until though which is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
username with name until though which is
this<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.610> character<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.300> before<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this little character here before a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070 
this little character here before a
Digimon<00:00:55.379> vbus<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> yeah

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
Digimon vbus so yeah

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.950 
Digimon vbus so yeah
with<00:00:59.680> to<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.250> namespace<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:00.790> just<00:01:01.180> need<00:01:01.390> the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
with to that namespace you just need the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.990 
with to that namespace you just need the
self<00:01:02.350> permission<00:01:03.130> but<00:01:03.280> if<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.550> want<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.820> use

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
self permission but if you want to use

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.790 
self permission but if you want to use
another<00:01:04.150> namespace<00:01:04.900> for<00:01:04.930> example<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.270> I

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
another namespace for example this I

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.720 
another namespace for example this I
would<00:01:08.800> need<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.390> permission<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:11.170> actually

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
would need the permission to actually

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.710 
would need the permission to actually
use<00:01:12.730> that<00:01:12.760> namespace

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
use that namespace

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.600 
use that namespace
I<00:01:13.750> currently<00:01:14.350> do<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.740> permission<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.430> use

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
I currently do have permission to use

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.310 
I currently do have permission to use
that<00:01:15.820> namespace<00:01:16.030> like<00:01:16.510> good<00:01:16.750> savored<00:01:17.170> there

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
that namespace like good savored there

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.550 
that namespace like good savored there
but<00:01:17.590> yet<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.610> namespace<00:01:18.910> also<00:01:19.720> is<00:01:19.990> too<00:01:20.320> long

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
but yet this namespace also is too long

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.810 
but yet this namespace also is too long
to<00:01:20.740> fit<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.190> sign

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
to fit on the sign

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
to fit on the sign
so<00:01:21.940> therefore<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.479> clock<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.930> actually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so therefore the clock in actually

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.030 
so therefore the clock in actually
shorts<00:01:24.700> into<00:01:25.510> just<00:01:25.780> beasts<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.830> fits

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
shorts into just beasts so that it fits

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
shorts into just beasts so that it fits
on<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.280> site

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
on the site

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
on the site
so<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.760> just<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> save<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.840> name

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
so I'm just going to save it in my name

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.850 
so I'm just going to save it in my name
space<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.729> can<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> says<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.080> saved<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
space here can see it says it's saved it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.790 
space here can see it says it's saved it
under<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.520> name<00:01:35.700> space<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> yeah<00:01:38.000> yeah

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
under that name space so yeah yeah

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.560 
under that name space so yeah yeah
now<00:01:40.800> that's<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.090> tell<00:01:42.300> about

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
now that's a it will just tell about

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.200 
now that's a it will just tell about
basic<00:01:44.690> place<00:01:45.690> second<00:01:46.650> line<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.160> have<00:01:47.369> area

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
basic place second line you have area

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510 
basic place second line you have area
now<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.810> first<00:01:49.110> line<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> put<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.400> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
now on the first line you can put in the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.050 
now on the first line you can put in the
Ling<00:01:50.700> space

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Ling space

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
Ling space
if<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.350> using<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.860> own<00:01:52.920> name<00:01:53.070> space

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
if you're just using your own name space

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.640 
if you're just using your own name space
you<00:01:53.909> don't<00:01:54.150> actually<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.290> impact

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
you don't actually need to put an impact

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.050 
you don't actually need to put an impact
and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.190> pull<00:01:56.550> up<00:01:56.580> third<00:01:57.450> line<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.780> enter

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and then pull up third line you enter

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.240 
and then pull up third line you enter
the<00:02:00.060> first<00:02:00.540> area<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.259> want<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.009> fourth

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the first area you want and the fourth

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
the first area you want and the fourth
line<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:03.000> enter<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> second<00:02:03.810> area<00:02:04.050> or<00:02:04.560> you

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
line you can enter a second area or you

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.650 
line you can enter a second area or you
to<00:02:04.800> leave<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> blank<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
to leave a blank for now I'm going to

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.660 
to leave a blank for now I'm going to
leave<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> blank<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.410> I'll<00:02:07.500> show<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
leave it blank but I'll show it the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.130 
leave it blank but I'll show it the
second<00:02:09.030> area<00:02:09.209> soon<00:02:11.330> okay<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.660> area<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> know

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
second area soon okay the area I know

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.540 
second area soon okay the area I know
this<00:02:13.410> doesn't<00:02:13.620> exist<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:15.120> Linux<00:02:15.570> it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
this doesn't exist because on Linux it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.520 
this doesn't exist because on Linux it
sometimes<00:02:17.550> messes<00:02:18.239> up<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.900> casing<00:02:19.440> because

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
sometimes messes up with casing because

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.490 
sometimes messes up with casing because
Linux<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.880> very<00:02:21.600> pedantic<00:02:22.050> without

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
Linux is very very pedantic without

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.630 
Linux is very very pedantic without
casing<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.510> now<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> right-click<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
casing so now if you right-click it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.770 
casing so now if you right-click it
toggles<00:02:29.640> between<00:02:29.910> areas<00:02:30.600> those<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:32.780> hyphens

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
toggles between areas those are hyphens

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.259 
toggles between areas those are hyphens
can<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.380> shown<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> show<00:02:35.459> which<00:02:35.700> area<00:02:36.120> it's

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
can be shown to show which area it's

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.350 
can be shown to show which area it's
currently<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:37.590> also<00:02:37.880> toggle<00:02:38.880> these<00:02:39.120> with

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
currently on can also toggle these with

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.020 
currently on can also toggle these with
redstone<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.700> yet

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.960 

so<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.240> basics<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.500> toggle<00:02:46.890> area<00:02:47.310> panic

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
so the basics of the toggle area panic

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.700 
so the basics of the toggle area panic
now<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:49.070> going<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.450> create<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.810> second<00:02:52.380> part

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
now I'm going to create a second part

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.490 
now I'm going to create a second part
this<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.460> second<00:02:57.060> area<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.840> it'll

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
this like a second area and it'll

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.120 
this like a second area and it'll
basically<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.840> closed<00:03:00.840> version<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.860> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
basically just be closed version now I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.000 
basically just be closed version now I
need<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.820> still<00:03:03.210> have<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.570> set<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.290> it's<00:03:04.590> full

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
need to still have it set so it's full

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.090 
need to still have it set so it's full
square<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.450> overrides<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.410> upper

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
square so that it overrides the upper

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.980 
square so that it overrides the upper
blocks<00:03:08.460> here<00:03:08.790> which<00:03:09.210> is<00:03:09.360> why<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.570> made<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
blocks here which is why I made the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.060 
blocks here which is why I made the
selection<00:03:10.560> before<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.370> got<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:15.590> okay<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.950> now

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
selection before I got this okay so now

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:30.780 
selection before I got this okay so now
I've<00:03:17.190> saved<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.640> as<00:03:17.790> cheap<00:03:18.420> closed

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.149 

so<00:03:31.390> there<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:31.629> go<00:03:31.780> now<00:03:32.290> toggle<00:03:32.709> switch<00:03:32.950> make

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
so there we go now toggle switch make

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.420 
so there we go now toggle switch make
clothes<00:03:33.459> tonight<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:35.530> do<00:03:35.680> some<00:03:35.890> fun<00:03:36.189> things

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
clothes tonight to do some fun things

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.699 
clothes tonight to do some fun things
with<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.849> such<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.420> maybe<00:03:37.959> making<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.439> player

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
with this such as maybe making a player

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.050 
with this such as maybe making a player
sense

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.300 

so<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.420> players<00:03:44.660> pull<00:03:45.500> currently<00:03:46.160> it's

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
so the players pull currently it's

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.760 
so the players pull currently it's
inverted<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:47.150> huge<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.990> out<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.380> roadster

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
inverted but huge is out like a roadster

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.559 
inverted but huge is out like a roadster
and<00:03:49.069> verse<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.550> there<00:03:49.730> or<00:03:49.880> something<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.540> that

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
and verse in there or something so that

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.410 
and verse in there or something so that
gate<00:03:51.440> opens<00:03:52.010> as<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.490> player<00:03:52.730> gets<00:03:52.970> close<00:03:53.240> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
gate opens as the player gets close to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.030 
gate opens as the player gets close to
it<00:03:55.240> but<00:03:56.240> yes<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:56.830> onto<00:03:57.880> namespaces<00:03:58.880> I<00:03:59.120> went<00:03:59.720> and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.620 

something<00:04:03.040> over<00:04:03.160> here<00:04:03.460> for<00:04:03.850> example<00:04:03.880> I'm<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
something over here for example I'm a

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.460 
something over here for example I'm a
hot<00:04:05.530> plant<00:04:05.830> before<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.970> put<00:04:07.540> down<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:07.930> put<00:04:08.440> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
hot plant before I put down this put a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.010 
hot plant before I put down this put a
pot<00:04:08.650> plant<00:04:08.800> on<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:10.180> crowd<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.750> Daisy<00:04:13.020> so

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
pot plant on it and a crowd for Daisy so

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.129 
pot plant on it and a crowd for Daisy so
if<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.260> select<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:15.270> area<00:04:16.270> say

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
if I select this area say

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.690 
if I select this area say
or

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.570 

and<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.480> put<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.990> namespace

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and then I put it in the namespace

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.750 
and then I put it in the namespace
that's<00:04:24.590> okay<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.830> currently<00:04:26.400> don't<00:04:26.640> have

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
that's okay I currently don't have

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.160 
that's okay I currently don't have
permission<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.420> use<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.930> namespace<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:30.800> yeah

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
permission to use that namespace so yeah

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.140 
permission to use that namespace so yeah
all<00:04:34.170> that<00:04:34.380> one<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:35.100> okay<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:37.670> I'll<00:04:38.670> save<00:04:39.120> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
command and I will create this but I'll

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.250 
command and I will create this but I'll
specify<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.940> name<00:04:54.210> space<00:04:54.540> in<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> sign<00:04:55.050> this

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
specify the name space in the sign this

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.120 
specify the name space in the sign this
time<00:04:56.780> it's<00:04:57.780> okay<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.620> I've<00:04:58.710> got<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.980> name

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
specified on the sign and now that I've

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.350 
specified on the sign and now that I've
written<00:05:02.610> down<00:05:02.730> they<00:05:03.180> are<00:05:04.100> on<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.850> namespace

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
written down they are on the namespace

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.350 
written down they are on the namespace
it<00:05:06.780> does<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.200> due<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.190> some<00:05:08.550> current<00:05:08.760> bug

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
it does this due to some current bug

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.870 
it does this due to some current bug
with<00:05:09.570> world<00:05:10.020> at<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.860> way<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:11.280> it

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.370 
things such as that because it's a plant
pot<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.940> flower<00:05:21.330> item<00:05:21.810> isn't<00:05:21.960> actually

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
pot and the flower item isn't actually

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.280 
pot and the flower item isn't actually
technically<00:05:22.860> placed<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.790> causes<00:05:24.690> this<00:05:24.870> little

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
technically placed it causes this little

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.410 
technically placed it causes this little
bug<00:05:25.680> here<00:05:26.040> do<00:05:26.850> -<00:05:27.030> well<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.450> is<00:05:29.030> I'm<00:05:30.030> hoping

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
bug here do - well that is I'm hoping

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.100 
bug here do - well that is I'm hoping
that'll<00:05:30.780> be<00:05:30.900> fixed<00:05:31.290> soon<00:05:31.790> but<00:05:32.790> I'm<00:05:33.090> not<00:05:33.630> really

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
that'll be fixed soon but I'm not really

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.950 
that'll be fixed soon but I'm not really
sure<00:05:34.290> when<00:05:34.740> I'll<00:05:34.920> be<00:05:34.950> fixed<00:05:38.600> but<00:05:39.600> yeah<00:05:39.780> so

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
sure when I'll be fixed but yeah so

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.140 
sure when I'll be fixed but yeah so
that's<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.380> basics<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.280> toggle<00:05:41.700> areas

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
that's the basics of toggle areas

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.090 
that's the basics of toggle areas
there's<00:05:42.660> more<00:05:43.080> that<00:05:43.260> can<00:05:43.380> be<00:05:43.440> done<00:05:43.530> with<00:05:43.890> them

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
there's more that can be done with them

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.970 
there's more that can be done with them
and<00:05:44.340> you<00:05:44.550> can<00:05:44.730> technically<00:05:45.330> hook<00:05:46.080> up<00:05:46.260> multiple

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
and you can technically hook up multiple

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.430 
and you can technically hook up multiple
area<00:05:47.700> signs<00:05:48.090> for<00:05:48.360> example<00:05:48.810> you<00:05:49.260> could<00:05:49.410> have

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
area signs for example you could have

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.970 
area signs for example you could have
one<00:05:49.830> here<00:05:50.400> which<00:05:51.120> would<00:05:51.300> have<00:05:51.480> area<00:05:52.050> one<00:05:52.350> area

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
one here which would have area one area

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.120 
one here which would have area one area
to<00:05:53.340> you<00:05:53.550> on<00:05:53.610> it<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:53.940> then<00:05:54.840> say<00:05:55.350> another<00:05:55.710> heal

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
to you on it and then say another heal

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.310 
to you on it and then say another heal
which<00:05:56.730> would<00:05:56.910> have<00:05:57.060> area<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.660> an<00:05:57.870> area<00:05:58.230> 3<00:05:59.000> and

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
which would have area to an area 3 and

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.170 
which would have area to an area 3 and
then<00:06:01.320> you'd<00:06:01.470> like

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
then you'd like

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.300 
then you'd like
well<00:06:03.180> yeah<00:06:03.600> it's<00:06:03.750> tough<00:06:03.900> in<00:06:04.110> there<00:06:04.290> on<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.560> one

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
well yeah it's tough in there on the one

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.960 
well yeah it's tough in there on the one
line<00:06:05.520> down<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.570> like<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:06.990> turn<00:06:07.200> this<00:06:07.350> one<00:06:07.590> on

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
line down so like you turn this one on

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.700 
line down so like you turn this one on
so<00:06:08.970> say<00:06:09.420> this<00:06:09.570> was<00:06:09.720> an<00:06:09.840> area<00:06:10.050> one<00:06:10.350> you<00:06:10.560> could

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
so say this was an area one you could

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.880 
so say this was an area one you could
turn<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:10.950> on<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.760> off<00:06:12.660> then<00:06:13.350> this<00:06:13.500> one<00:06:13.740> on

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
turn that on and off then this one on

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.860 
turn that on and off then this one on
and<00:06:14.130> off<00:06:14.310> and<00:06:14.580> it<00:06:14.700> would<00:06:14.790> just<00:06:14.970> go<00:06:15.210> through<00:06:15.510> or

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
and off and it would just go through or

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.840 
and off and it would just go through or
if<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.200> set<00:06:16.410> it<00:06:16.530> up<00:06:16.650> in<00:06:17.040> a<00:06:17.160> really<00:06:17.520> complicated

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
if you set it up in a really complicated

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.330 
if you set it up in a really complicated
method<00:06:18.570> you<00:06:18.720> could<00:06:18.900> probably<00:06:19.350> get<00:06:19.860> at<00:06:20.010> area

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
method you could probably get at area

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.790 
method you could probably get at area
one<00:06:20.580> two<00:06:20.850> three<00:06:21.240> four<00:06:21.540> it's<00:06:22.080> just<00:06:22.290> generally<00:06:22.770> a

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
one two three four it's just generally a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.250 
one two three four it's just generally a
lot<00:06:22.980> easier<00:06:23.340> just<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:23.910> duplicate<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.050> last

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
lot easier just to duplicate the last

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.420 
lot easier just to duplicate the last
one<00:06:25.530> across<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.520> signs<00:06:26.730> like<00:06:26.940> that<00:06:28.250> so<00:06:29.250> that

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
one across the signs like that so that

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.210 
one across the signs like that so that
basically<00:06:30.300> concludes<00:06:30.750> this<00:06:31.170> simple<00:06:31.650> tutorial

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
basically concludes this simple tutorial

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.200 
basically concludes this simple tutorial
on<00:06:32.340> total<00:06:32.880> area

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
on total area

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.749 
on total area
I<00:06:33.240> may<00:06:33.660> in<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.900> future<00:06:34.009> make<00:06:35.009> tutorial<00:06:35.639> about

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
I may in the future make tutorial about

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.520 
I may in the future make tutorial about
what<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.180> just<00:06:36.389> demonstrated<00:06:36.570> there<00:06:37.199> with

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
what I just demonstrated there with

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.570 
what I just demonstrated there with
multiple<00:06:38.330> area<00:06:39.330> signs<00:06:39.600> together<00:06:40.310> and<00:06:41.310> yeah

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
multiple area signs together and yeah

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.330 
multiple area signs together and yeah
bye
