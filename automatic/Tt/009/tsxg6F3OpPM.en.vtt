00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.629
 hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hi all 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.400
 the world already knows it finds itself 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.170
 today for the latest booster of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.369
 four booster xy furious point that I 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.939
 we had bought for the little ones 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.950
 lunches 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.020
 this is the booster in blister of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.400
 raw to free and I hope we could 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.779
 there is a good pick on the inside 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.730
 I believe that the three previous ones we 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.980
 had given three rare so between us 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.689
 it was not very famous mu we rest 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.980
 still a booster we can still cross 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.600
 fingers to have a good pick 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.860
 in the room and furious point I you 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400
 propose immediately to move to his 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.199
 opening 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.270
 however, maybe I'll show you 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.500
 before the back of a blistered booster 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.820
 because I had not done for them 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.540
 three precedents of the blow it could 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.579
 to interest you 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.129
 and I'm going to take the scissors and 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.870
 cut it all off because I want that 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.250
 the booster I want to open to lasseube 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 booster if it's been a while they 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.829
 drag on my mangas 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.469
 it might be time for me to move to 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.000
 its opening here is raw to free and a 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.649
 little pokemon who is doing very badly in 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.780
 strategy when he uses his attack 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.640
 acrobatic foot there that falls from the sky and if 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.899
 she walks she does a lot a lot 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.460
 damage 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.020
 then the back of a boost was not 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.240
 case pose if you wish to become 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.350
 the king of the ring and I go on to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.750
 the opening of it 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.159
 let's go see what he's going 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.840
 we reserve I am not at all what 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.189
 to wait for me and whatever we have I feel that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.310
 it will be a good breakfast 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.180
 then the little code it is for you and 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.590
 I put good cards in the end go 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.869
 it's gone to see what we 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.860
 could get this morning we have 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.689
 as the first card 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.520

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.970

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.310

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.390

 furious I will tell them one last 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.600
 shock time match makes me think of sangoku 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.740
 who participate in the tournament when he 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.820
 was small 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.720
 I really feel like that's it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.130

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.479

 journalist fighting so who's going 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.770

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.969
 happen in all of Syria behind 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.130
 we have galy fire they train in 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.989
 breaking wood then we have 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.590
 Bagadig like this one that made 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.910
 long time 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.650
 as much as I do not really 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.879
 my heart as it was a long time 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.720
 that I had not seen so that makes me 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.480
 pleasure to see her again 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.980
 we follow with henri birth a boost eu 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.599
 form only in the pokemon series 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.050
 fight I do not know at all what he 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.730
 done here 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.800
 so someone is not hesitate to me 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.530
 to say it in comment it interests me and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.500
 the finished 7 breakfasts and this 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.330
 booster piece by these parties at a 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 the graph bah voila here it is 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.540
 was enough to ask ben benonnière 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.950
 whaou 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.660
 so for those who would never have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.519
 noticed we notice behind the nets 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.220
 of the ring so I think he did a 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.959
 pole jump directly to the target 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.269
 which is in this case us since 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.739
 go straight on us 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.130
 is going to take a big hit in the 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.510
 face 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.579
 look at me the four arms are in 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.709
 the air he will prepare a very very big 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.940
 punch 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.170
 I hope you are resistant because 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.120
 that there seen how he's going to hit us on 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.010
 is going to have very very very very very badly 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.420
 beautiful holographic I'm not even sure 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.860
 to have it in my collection I believe 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.110
 that not even in fact and what I already have 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.640
 got my known in the past very very 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.290
 good question in any case the series 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.060
 of four hairstyles booster 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.709
 eyes ends very well until the final 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.389
 we finish this role graphically so we 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.340
 will not have had that rare to a 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.450
 it's nice at least what stops 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.160
 not to say that I have that rare all 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.540
 the time we had a Mâconnais 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.010
 monographic rank I still show you 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.900

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.269
 admired at most this illustration 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.099
 she is really beautiful and that's it 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.590
 I finally love a map that corresponds 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.569

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.180
