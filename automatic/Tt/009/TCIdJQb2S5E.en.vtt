00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
first time I've been in Linville Gorge

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.439 
first time I've been in Linville Gorge
area<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.880> first<00:00:29.880> little<00:00:30.150> part<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
area with my first little part of the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
area with my first little part of the
trail<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.689> pretty<00:00:31.170> steep<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.700> made

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
trail is pretty steep and I've just made

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.220 
trail is pretty steep and I've just made
it<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.630> I'm<00:00:33.690> stopping<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it up that and so I'm stopping to take a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600 
it up that and so I'm stopping to take a
break<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.710> because<00:00:35.010> I've<00:00:35.160> never<00:00:35.309> been<00:00:35.460> able

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
break here because I've never been able

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.670 
break here because I've never been able
to<00:00:35.790> shoot<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.780> its<00:00:36.930> glory<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.410> think

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
to shoot this in all its glory I think

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.990 
to shoot this in all its glory I think
I've<00:00:38.550> never<00:00:38.820> had<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:40.010> camcorder<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.760> would

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
I've never had a camcorder that would

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.590 
I've never had a camcorder that would
shoot<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> wide<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.829> shooting<00:00:44.250> 4k<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:45.000> 15

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
shoot that wide I'm shooting 4k video 15

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
shoot that wide I'm shooting 4k video 15
frames<00:00:46.140> per<00:00:46.289> second<00:00:46.800> wide<00:00:47.539> on<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.750> hero<00:00:49.020> 3<00:00:49.910> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
frames per second wide on my hero 3 and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.990 
frames per second wide on my hero 3 and
so<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.420> say<00:00:51.600> 15<00:00:52.020> frames<00:00:52.289> per<00:00:52.410> second<00:00:53.000> it's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so if I say 15 frames per second it's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
so if I say 15 frames per second it's
not<00:00:54.230> there's<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> perfect<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> shoot<00:00:56.309> but

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
not there's the perfect way to shoot but

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.979 
not there's the perfect way to shoot but
definitely<00:00:57.570> 4k<00:00:57.989> video<00:00:59.539> captures<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> whole<00:01:00.780> lot

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
definitely 4k video captures a whole lot

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
definitely 4k video captures a whole lot
more<00:01:01.140> than<00:01:01.469> what<00:01:01.620> you're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.129> with

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
more than what you're going to see with

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.709 
more than what you're going to see with
the<00:01:02.430> any<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:02.940> camcorder<00:01:03.539> I've<00:01:03.600> ever

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the any other camcorder I've ever

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
the any other camcorder I've ever
brought<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
brought out here so this is what it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
brought out here so this is what it
looks<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.049> shooting<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
looks like that shooting down into the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
looks like that shooting down into the
gorge<00:01:08.360> back<00:01:09.360> toward<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> chimneys<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> I'm

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gorge back toward the chimneys and I'm

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
gorge back toward the chimneys and I'm
going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> try<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> hit<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.890> way

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
going to try to hit back out that way

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to try to hit back out that way
after<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> while<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.299> Linville<00:01:15.630> River<00:01:15.810> flows

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
after a while so Linville River flows

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
after a while so Linville River flows
down<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.790> let's<00:01:17.790> kind<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.180> slowly

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
down in there let's kind of go slowly

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.340 
down in there let's kind of go slowly
around<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.439> what's<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
around so you can see what's here and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
around so you can see what's here and
Table<00:01:22.350> Rock<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.400> above<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
Table Rock is way up above me that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
Table Rock is way up above me that
outcropping<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> top<00:01:25.409> that's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
outcropping up there to the top that's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.230 
outcropping up there to the top that's
where<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.670> headed

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
place here on the trail I'm probably not

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.410 
place here on the trail I'm probably not
even<00:01:56.549> 50<00:01:57.270> 70<00:01:57.810> yards<00:01:58.200> beyond<00:01:58.680> where<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> just

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
even 50 70 yards beyond where I just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.050 
even 50 70 yards beyond where I just
shot<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.659> while<00:02:00.840> ago

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
shot a while ago

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.460 
shot a while ago
looks<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.840> could<00:02:02.960> be<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> little<00:02:03.230> bear

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
looks like it could be a little bear

dander sent from designation it's for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.960 
dander sent from designation it's for
point<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.650> reference<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:07.160> kind<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.520> how

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
point of reference that's kind of how

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.630 
point of reference that's kind of how
I'm<00:02:08.180> sized<00:02:08.509> compared<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.610> that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
I'm sized compared to it so that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.620 
I'm sized compared to it so that
outcropping<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:11.720> goes<00:02:11.930> up<00:02:12.170> probably<00:02:13.630> 20

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.010 
outcropping there goes up probably 20
feet<00:02:14.870> or<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.640> probably<00:02:16.640> about<00:02:16.730> 15<00:02:17.300> 16<00:02:17.540> feet

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
feet or so probably about 15 16 feet

there<00:02:18.230> at<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.410> point<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.460> is<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.790> little

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
there at that point and this is a little

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.240 
there at that point and this is a little

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
Table Rock here out in front office it
kind<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.700> outcropping<00:02:26.600> that's

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
kind of is a little outcropping that's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.320 
kind of is a little outcropping that's
beautiful<00:02:27.200> out<00:02:27.290> there<00:02:27.320> at<00:02:27.620> jets<00:02:27.890> off<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:29.120> off

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
beautiful out there at jets off just off

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.630 
beautiful out there at jets off just off
to<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:30.050> guess<00:02:30.320> sort<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.650> north<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.160> west<00:02:31.280> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
to the I guess sort of north or west of

to the I guess sort of north or west of
Table<00:02:32.030> Rock<00:02:32.290> Table<00:02:33.290> Rock<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.560> actually<00:02:33.950> back

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
Table Rock Table Rock is actually back

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.699 
Table Rock Table Rock is actually back
up<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.580> way<00:02:34.850> behind<00:02:35.270> me<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.410> kind<00:02:36.650> of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
up this way behind me this is kind of

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.490 
up this way behind me this is kind of
one<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.890> my<00:02:37.010> favorite<00:02:37.430> spots<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.990> trail<00:02:39.200> up

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
one of my favorite spots on the trail up

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
one of my favorite spots on the trail up
you<00:02:40.430> get<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:40.640> kind<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:40.970> place<00:02:41.510> with<00:02:41.690> rock<00:02:41.990> is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you get this kind of place with rock is

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.949 
you get this kind of place with rock is
split<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:44.000> rock<00:02:44.209> you're<00:02:44.390> seeing<00:02:44.690> there

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
split off the rock you're seeing there

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.770 
split off the rock you're seeing there
to<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> left<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.800> probably<00:02:46.480> guessing<00:02:47.480> about

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
to the left is probably guessing about

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.920 
to the left is probably guessing about
18<00:02:48.200> feet<00:02:48.230> high<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:50.000> we're<00:02:50.120> really<00:02:50.270> not<00:02:50.480> too<00:02:50.690> far

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
18 feet high so we're really not too far

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.510 
18 feet high so we're really not too far
from<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.350> top<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.709> Table<00:02:51.980> Rock<00:02:52.100> once<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.400> eat

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
from the top of Table Rock once we eat

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.680 
from the top of Table Rock once we eat
here<00:02:52.640> we're<00:02:52.790> probably<00:02:52.910> three-quarters<00:02:53.660> of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
here we're probably three-quarters of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.930 
here we're probably three-quarters of
the<00:02:53.810> way<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.280> we've<00:02:55.430> been<00:02:55.550> doing<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.760> lot<00:02:55.910> of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the way up and we've been doing a lot of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.720 
the way up and we've been doing a lot of
switchbacks<00:02:56.920> gorges<00:02:57.920> back<00:02:58.100> off<00:02:58.280> down<00:02:58.520> that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
switchbacks gorges back off down that

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.940 
switchbacks gorges back off down that
way<00:02:59.170> once<00:03:00.170> again<00:03:00.380> here's<00:03:00.530> kind<00:03:00.770> of<00:03:00.800> how<00:03:00.860> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
way once again here's kind of how the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.190 
way once again here's kind of how the
trail<00:03:01.160> looks<00:03:01.660> here's<00:03:02.660> how<00:03:02.840> I'm<00:03:03.020> looking

trail looks here's how I'm looking
having<00:03:04.190> negotiated<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.769> pretty<00:03:06.950> hard

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
having negotiated it it's a pretty hard

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.340 
having negotiated it it's a pretty hard
with<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.510> tote<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.930> all<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.170> stuff

with a the tote and all that stuff
though<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:09.890> yeah<00:03:10.760> here's<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.209> cool<00:03:11.959> little

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
though so yeah here's this cool little

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.500 
though so yeah here's this cool little
part<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> trail<00:03:12.830> here<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:14.120> get<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.360> walk

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
part of the trail here we get to walk

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.600 
part of the trail here we get to walk
through<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.870> cliff<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.290> rock<00:03:15.530> here<00:03:15.830> okay

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
through the cliff to the rock here okay

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.130 
through the cliff to the rock here okay
so<00:03:16.640> i've<00:03:16.820> maed<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.300> top<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.720> one<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.019> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
so i've maed to the top of one of the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.640 
so i've maed to the top of one of the
awesomest<00:03:19.040> places<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:20.260> appalachian<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> think

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
awesomest places in appalachian I think

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.670 
awesomest places in appalachian I think
this<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.670> top<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.060> Table<00:03:23.360> Rock<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:24.530> that's

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
this is the top of Table Rock and that's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.350 
this is the top of Table Rock and that's
just<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.980> little<00:03:25.190> bit<00:03:25.310> below<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.670> top<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.209> it

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
just a little bit below the top of it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.570 
just a little bit below the top of it
now<00:03:26.480> I've<00:03:26.630> walked<00:03:26.840> kind<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.459> toward<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
now I've walked kind of toward the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.539 
now I've walked kind of toward the
southward<00:03:29.060> end<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.070> I've<00:03:31.220> got<00:03:31.400> my
