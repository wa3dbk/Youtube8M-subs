paddle<00:02:21.620> when<00:02:21.770> he's<00:02:21.890> done<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.120> might<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.510> a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
paddle when he's done so it might be a

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.960 
paddle when he's done so it might be a
good<00:02:23.570> thing<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.410> there<00:02:24.790> um<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.430 
good thing for that in there um it's
pretty<00:02:26.210> nice<00:02:26.470> nice<00:02:27.470> bottom<00:02:27.890> smooth<00:02:29.140> um<00:02:30.140> I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
pretty nice nice bottom smooth um I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.060 
pretty nice nice bottom smooth um I
would<00:02:30.590> also<00:02:30.740> recommend<00:02:32.650> putting<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
would also recommend putting one of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.470 
would also recommend putting one of
these<00:02:34.100> pieces<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.760> here<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:38.300> make<00:02:38.450> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
these pieces in here just to make a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.260 
these pieces in here just to make a
little<00:02:38.570> bit<00:02:38.840> smoother<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:41.030> still

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
little bit smoother but it's still

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.810 
little bit smoother but it's still
pretty<00:02:41.330> good<00:02:42.790> um<00:02:44.170> as<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.710> we've<00:02:45.920> got<00:02:46.250> it's
