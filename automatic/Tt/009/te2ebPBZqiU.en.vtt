the evaporation in the benefits of warm

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.720 
the evaporation in the benefits of warm
day<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:28.989> do<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.709> mornings<00:03:30.100> do<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.609> in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
day so do it in the mornings do it in

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.849 
day so do it in the mornings do it in
the<00:03:30.850> evenings<00:03:31.209> during<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.930> hot<00:03:32.109> day<00:03:32.350> outside

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.640 
the evenings during a hot day outside
that's<00:03:33.400> not<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.790> way<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.150> do<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:35.079> I<00:03:35.410> have<00:03:35.560> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
that's not the way to do it so I have a

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.199 
that's not the way to do it so I have a
