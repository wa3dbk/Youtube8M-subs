first<00:01:37.890> frame<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.880> frame<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
first frame the first frame and the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
first frame the first frame and the
third<00:01:39.630> frame<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> click<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
third frame you want to click that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
third frame you want to click that
because<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> second<00:01:42.810> frame<00:01:43.020> that's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because that is the second frame that's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.870 
because that is the second frame that's
what<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> said<00:01:43.619> where<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> stuff<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> going

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
what I said where all the stuff is going

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.380 
what I said where all the stuff is going
to<00:01:44.939> happen<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:47.009> back<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> find<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to happen at and go back and find in the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.590 
to happen at and go back and find in the
ease<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.549> video<00:01:50.549> effect<00:01:50.909> again<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> one

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
ease in video effect again this is one

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.899 
ease in video effect again this is one
that<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.930> comes<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.229> Windows<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that just comes with Windows and you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.929 
that just comes with Windows and you
want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> drop<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:55.070> four<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> those<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.790> can

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
want to drop in four of those you can

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.959 
want to drop in four of those you can
only<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.299> five<00:01:57.630> effects<00:01:58.079> total<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.100> any

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
only have five effects total in any

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.410 
only have five effects total in any
given<00:02:00.240> frame<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:02.579> we've<00:02:02.820> already<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
given frame so we've already got that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.010 
given frame so we've already got that
double<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.740> slow<00:02:05.009> down<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.840> we're<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
double that slow down so we're going to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.969 
double that slow down so we're going to
go<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.380> we're<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> pull<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
go in here and we're going to pull that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
go in here and we're going to pull that
slow<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.700> which<00:02:09.360> means<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
slow down out which means going to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
slow down out which means going to
shrink<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> back<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> five<00:02:10.860> seconds<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
shrink it back down to five seconds so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.890 
shrink it back down to five seconds so
this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.940> neat<00:02:12.090> effect<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.720> works

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
this is just a neat effect that works

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
this is just a neat effect that works
with<00:02:13.050> windows

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
with windows

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.289 
with windows
since<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.519> right<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.849> we'll<00:02:14.969> go<00:02:15.060> ahead<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
since the right here we'll go ahead and

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.410 
since the right here we'll go ahead and
throw<00:02:15.840> ease<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:17.299> again<00:02:18.299> for<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> fifth<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
throw ease in again for a fifth time and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.869 
throw ease in again for a fifth time and
when<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> click<00:02:22.409> OK<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.280> you're<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.670> see

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
when I click OK here you're going to see

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.520 
when I click OK here you're going to see
that<00:02:23.909> is<00:02:24.150> what<00:02:24.299> happens<00:02:24.719> is<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.230> third

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
that is what happens is that that third

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.039 
that is what happens is that that third
frame<00:02:25.980> gets<00:02:26.430> sucked<00:02:26.969> right<00:02:27.299> on<00:02:27.510> top<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
frame gets sucked right on top of the

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.839 
frame gets sucked right on top of the
other<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.469> that's<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> only<00:02:29.489> way<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.670> can

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
other two that's the only way you can

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.020 
other two that's the only way you can
get<00:02:30.000> three<00:02:30.329> frames<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.900> appear<00:02:31.290> at<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.819> same

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
get three frames to appear at the same

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.559 
get three frames to appear at the same
time<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.629> because<00:02:34.409> i'm<00:02:34.680> using<00:02:35.209> my<00:02:36.209> video

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
time and because i'm using my video

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.089 
time and because i'm using my video
capture<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.109> looks<00:02:37.319> kind<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.590> choppy<00:02:37.829> there

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
capture it looks kind of choppy there

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.229 
capture it looks kind of choppy there
