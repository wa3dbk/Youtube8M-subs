- PATTY IN
PARK CITY, UTAH, TEXTS:

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.118
- WELL, THE ONLY THING
I'VE EVER BEEN ADDICTED TO

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.554
IS A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.989
I GUESS THAT
DOESN'T COUNT, THOUGH.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.891
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:26.393
I AM ABOUT TO GO
AND GET MYSELF ADDICTED

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.262
TO SOMETHING STRONGER

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:31.131
AND MORE POWERFUL
THAN KNOWLEDGE.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.399
AHA.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:36.303
THOSE ARE NICELY MADE LINES.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.838
WELL, I HAVE NEVER
DONE COCAINE BEFORE,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.573
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EASY OR HARD IT IS

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.108
TO GET ADDICTED TO IT.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:44.678
I CONFESS I AM QUITE NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS, BUT--

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.081
THANK YOU.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.850
BON VOYAGE.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.151
- HAPPY SAILING.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.653
- [snorts]

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.121
[grunts]

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:56.190
AAH. OH!

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.158
THAT'S LIKE BLEACH
IN MY SINUSES.

00:00:58.192 --> 00:00:59.426
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.296
[coughs, hacks]

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.065
NO. THAT'S A TERRIBLE FEELING.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.266
GOOD-BYE, COCAINE.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.068
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
MISTER--

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.370
AAH.
- WHAT?

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.172
YOU WOULD'VE LIKED
TO HAVE DONE THAT COCAINE?

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.774
- NO.
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.376
THAT'S ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.445
I FEEL LIKE GOING FOR A WALK.
YOU WANNA GO FOR A WALK?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.080
- YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH REAL QUICK.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.515
- THAT'S FINE.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.617
SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY
CAN'T GET ADDICTED.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.619
THEIR BRAINS ARE TOO STURDY.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.120
COULD THIS BE MY PROBLEM?

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.489
I TESTED THAT HYPOTHESIS
WITH TWO OTHER

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.558
FAMOUSLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES:

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.227
CIGARETTES FILLED
WITH TOBACCO...

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.095
[coughing]

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.296
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.831
AND ALCOHOLIC WINE.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.968
BUT I COULD NOT GET
THOSE MONKEYS ON MY BACK.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.904
ALL THIS DOES
IS MAKE ME SLEEPY.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.007
I THINK I'LL, UH,
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:50.744
[exhales]

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.913
SO YOU CAN ADD ALCOHOL
TO THE LIST

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.581
OF [bleep]
I'M NOT ADDICTED TO.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.517
I MEAN, MAYBE I'M JUST
INVULNERABLE TO ADDICTION.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.352
LIKE, WHAT AM I,
A SUPERHERO?

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:00.053
IT'S MR. INVULNERABLE!

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.555
[laughs]

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.156
OKAY, SO I HAVE TRIED

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.825
COCAINE, CIGARETTES, ALCOHOL.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.326
DIDN'T GET ADDICTED
TO ANY OF THOSE.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.061
BUT THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I NEED TO TRY.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.330
COCAINE!
[chuckles]

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:13.233
JUST LIKE MY WIFE SUZANNE,
WHO FOR YEARS

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:16.436
HAD ENJOYED TAKING POT
FROM TIME TO TIME,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.405
MY OCCASIONAL RECREATIONAL USE
OF COCAINE

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.240
HAD IMPROVED MY LIFE.

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:21.942
I WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE...

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.577
RED ONES AND YELLOW ONES.
I GOT A LOT OF RED BOOKS--

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.845
I MADE MORE SCARVES...

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.847
I'M MAKING YOU ONE.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.081
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL WEAR IT
OR NOT--I DON'T EVEN CARE.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.349
I WAS A BETTER FATHER.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:30.617
CHICKEN LITTLE GOES UP
TO HENNY PENNY.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.252
"HENNY PENNY,
THE SKY IS FALLING!"

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:33.620
AND OF COURSE HENNY PENNY
DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.088
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE SKY IS FALLING?"

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.523
THE SKY IS FALLING!

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:38.258
[snores]

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.394
[sniffs]
OKAY.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:41.628
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.096
- HEY, FORREST.
- [grunts]

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.464
- DID YOU MAKE
14 ATM WITHDRAW--

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.933
WHOA.
- YEAH, SORRY.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.467
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- NOTHING, IT BROKE.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:48.735
IT JUST BROKE.
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.103
NO. WHAT? WHAT?
- OKAY.

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:52.306
SOMEBODY MADE 14 ATM WITHDRAWALS
THIS WEEK.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.574
- WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME
THAT IT WOULD BE ME?

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:54.808
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER MAYBE

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.243
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME IS DOING IT?

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.477
IT COULD BE
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:58.745
- WHO'S WHAT'S-HIS-NAME?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.380
- YOU KNOW, UPSTAIRS.

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:02.216
THE KID.
[clears throat]

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.550
ALL RIGHT, HOT SHOT,
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.319
- ERIC?

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.421
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YES, YOU WIN THAT ONE.

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.755
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.057
- NOTHING'S WRONG.
I'M FINE.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.227
I'M JUST TRYING
TO EAT SOMETHING.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.561
- [sighs]

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:16.163
- SHOW ME WHAT I DID WRONG.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.131
- I'M PRETTY SURE
THESE GRAY ONES GO IN HERE.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.466
- I VOLUNTEERED
TO CHAPERONE ERIC

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.401
AND HIS FRIENDS
ON A CAMPING TRIP

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:22.903
AND MADE
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.073
ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP
TO COCAINE.

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:27.975
WAIT A MINUTE.
HEY, ERIC.

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:31.245
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH,
THAT BAG THAT I HAD,

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:35.415
THAT LITTLE PLASTIC BAG
OF, UH, CAMPING POWDER?

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.917
- NO.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.086
- BEING SEPARATED
FROM COCAINE FOR SIX HOURS

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.121
MADE ME REALIZE
I HAD A PROBLEM,

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.356
AND I NEEDED HELP...

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.124
IN THE FORM
OF MORE COCAINE.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.826
- HEY, MR. MACNEIL.
- DO YOU HAVE IT?

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.794
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.596
GOD.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.131
ALL RIGHT, MEN, WE'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING THIS WEEKEND.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.533
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR
BIRD-WATCHING BADGES.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.168
WHO WANTS THEIR BIRD-WATCH--
ANYBODY WANT

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.136
THEIR BIRD-WATCHING BADGE,
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.005
WE'RE GONNA FIND SOME BIRDS,
AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH THEM,

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.506
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET OUR
ORIENTEERING BADGES, YOU GUYS.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.508
- YOUR NOSE IS BLEEDING.
- OH.

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.110
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK, YOU GUYS.

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:04.611
- DAD?
- I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:06.213
- DO YOU HAVE SHOOTING PAIN
DOWN YOUR ARM?

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.681
- YEAH, I GOT SHOOTING PAINS
EVERYWHERE.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.949
OH, MY GOD,
I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.350
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA DIE.

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.119
I AM DEFINITELY GONNA DIE!

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:13.353
OH, GOD! OH!
- DAD?

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:14.621
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.056
SHUT UP.
HOW DO YOU KNOW CPR?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.791
WHY DO YOU KNOW CPR?
THIS KID'S A COP!

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.493
- DAD?
- THIS KID IS A COP!

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.295
[birds chirping]

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.063
- WE DON'T KNOW
HOW HE'LL REACT,

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.699
BUT REMEMBER, YOU LITERALLY
COULD BE SAVING HIS LIFE.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.334
SO IT'S IMPORTANT
EVERYONE IS HERE AND--

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.569
- OH, MY--OKAY.
- OH, WHAT IS THIS?

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.237
OH, IS THIS AN INTERVENTION?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.073
ALWAYS A FAST LEARNER,
I WAS PROUD TO SEE

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.242
I HAD GONE FROM FUMBLED SNORTING
TO OVERDOSE

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.544
TO FAMILY INTERVENTION
IN RECORD TIME.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:38.912
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
PUT YOUR LETTERS AWAY.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.180
I CAN SAVE YOU SOME TIME.
NO, NO, NO.

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.548
I'VE BEEN A MONSTER, RIGHT?

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.150
EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY THAT,
RIGHT?

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:44.685
I'VE BEEN A REAL TERRIBLE DAD.
I LET YOU DOWN.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.520
I'VE BEEN A HORRIBLE
SON-IN-LAW.

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.922
I'VE BEEN A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
AS A DOG OWNER.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:51.158
I'VE BEEN SUCH A BAD NEIGHBOR.

00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.559
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I DID
TO THESE GUYS.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.494
WHO CARES?
LET'S GO TO REHAB!

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:55.762
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
TO REHAB!

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:57.331
COME ON, TOM, HURRY UP!

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.665
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.667
LET'S JUST GO!
LET'S JUST GO!

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.571
- I-I GUESS I SHOULD GO TOO.
- OKAY.

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:08.041
- SORRY.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.910
- WELL, I'M GONNA READ
MY SPEECH.

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.745
I WORKED HARD ON IT.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:14.548
"IN THE WORDS
OF GRANDMASTER FLASH,

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.950
"YOU GOING HIGH
ON THAT COCAINE.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.420
YOU GOING CRAZY
LIKE A COCAINE TRAIN."

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.889
- WHEN I GET BACK FROM REHAB,

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.590
I'LL PROBABLY SAY COCAINE
IS TERRIBLE,

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.426
BUT DON'T BELIEVE ME.
COCAINE IS AMAZING!

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.896
I GIVE IT A MILLION STARS!

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.064
DO NOT BELIEVE THE GUY
IN THE STUDIO

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.933
WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU
IT'S TERRIBLE.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.969
- [sobbing]
- THAT GUY IS A LIAR!
