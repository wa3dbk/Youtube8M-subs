00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.280
 the light goes out followed sing dynamite lighting solutions 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.270
 changed the luminous flux 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.270
 the color of the light and the direction of illumination 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.220
 so instead of a simple homophobe 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.410
 of lease 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.460
 and controlled so as to provide cost-effectiveness of operation and combine the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 more varied user needs 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.180
 we therefore need the same versatile and easy to use system 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.890
 a system based on which cost components are not listed 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.630
 with minimal wiring is a simple operating concept 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.859
 focused on light control 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.339
 in different environments 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.529
 it is in function of the different activities details environments take place 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.160
 like management system means that management of energy savings 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.900
 quality control denounces the power of natural light 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.350
 or via intelligent devices that combine light control in operation 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 of natural light 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.880
 detection presents with a sense 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.030
 means scenario management 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 almost for different communication needs 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.450
 which also means managing the color of dynamic light to animate environments 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 and to conceive lighting differently 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.770
 lms systems like enemies in the system 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.400
 based on late 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.490
 digital og6 stamp lighting interferes 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.520
 there was 1 10 volt 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.079
 standard interface does not cover Italy 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.079
 for dimmable electronic ballasts 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.280
 and the ticket 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 european federation low 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.109
 and the power struggles for haiti networks 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.240
 I hope that they fully cover all the necessary functions 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 for the management of a building 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 these technologies not only allow lighting control 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.090
 but also heating systems 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.439
 d air conditioning and climate control brooke security systems 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.240
 dani. instead mainly to the management of relative lighting 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.109
 to the environment since 2000 re 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.069
 but can be found if necessary 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.380
 also higher level building management systems 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.380
 through which you can because the vitelloni 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.410
 traditional 1 12 volt analog systems 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.160
 they do not allow independent adjustment of the devices connected to it 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.519
 control line 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.659
 it is therefore not possible to tie the brightness of individual sources to values 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.339
 local reference points 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:42.689
 for example to signal coming from external sensors that take into account the 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.119
 environmental brightness 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.829
 for the same reason it is not possible to switch on or off individually 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.299
 resurgence regulated by the same line 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 in general, each independent adjustment requires a line of 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.239
 independent control 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.269
 Moreover 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.480
 changing the status on the system implies wiring changes 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.809
 with the addressing water systems on the bottom 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.829
 all systems connected to the same control end can be 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.689
 individually adjusted 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.580
 the figure illustrates the conceptual difference 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.799
 or analogue regulation system 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 edurocca goes digital 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.919
 dalÃ¬ represents a system with distributed intelligence 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.789
 this means that the light emission value 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:35.029
 the different lighting scenarios grouping the different sources 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.209
 bright 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 they are stored in the electronic ballasts 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.589
 control system only has the function of calling up a specific one 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.350
 scenario and the electronic power supply 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.009
 who knows about free tv series - what 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.589
 act accordingly 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.339
 it is also possible to recall each individual inventor
