00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
what an interesting dynamic it could it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.889 
what an interesting dynamic it could it
could<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.829> Randy<00:00:56.610> Orton<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> face<00:00:57.870> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
could be if Randy Orton is the face of

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
could be if Randy Orton is the face of
the<00:00:58.140> company<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.579> doesn't<00:00:59.910> do

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the company but really doesn't do

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
the company but really doesn't do
anything<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> company<00:01:01.500> he's<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
anything for the company he's a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
anything for the company he's a
figurehead<00:01:02.340> puppet<00:01:02.760> champion<00:01:03.059> yes<00:01:03.180> yes<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
figurehead puppet champion yes yes and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.350 
figurehead puppet champion yes yes and
can<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.040> interesting<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can be interesting it could be and I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
can be interesting it could be and I
think<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.810> could<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.500> different<00:01:08.400> dynamic

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
think that could be a different dynamic

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
think that could be a different dynamic
where<00:01:09.060> eventually<00:01:09.390> Randy<00:01:09.869> Orton<00:01:10.260> gets

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
where eventually Randy Orton gets

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.030 
where eventually Randy Orton gets
frustrated<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> mean<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> then
