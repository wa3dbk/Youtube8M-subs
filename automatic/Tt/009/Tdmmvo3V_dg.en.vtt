00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 they have been around the store for a long time 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.019
 now the lego marvel can do it 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.059
 super heroes also keen on the beijing 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 all of them were now in the colleagues too 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 mentor and co on a trip to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.880
 cookie video game universe and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.880
 show batman where the hammer hangs 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.340
 dr you want world domination in itself 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.750
 tear and built one 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.390
 fateful machine with the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 Snappy doctor doom stingray of doom 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 even if he does not care for the name 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 has torn leg there is a lot 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.440
 heavier the items for 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.480
 zusammenzukriegen 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 because he needs namely the splitter of the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.370
 broken silver surfer surfboards 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 which are scattered all over Manhattan 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 as befits a real one 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.980
 Super Villains belonged to the search 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.110
 but do not share it yourself but 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.600
 because a whole lot of other marvels 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.130
 favorites like doctor octopus or the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.260
 sandmann to 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.940
 and there comes a game with me 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.740
 army of marvel superheroes is it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.270
 stop our task duplications 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.270
 Customers would have to make sure again 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.700
 The guy stands knocking and builds the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 foreground we beat each other through 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.080
 areal until we have everything and every big one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 sound have places lies other parts 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.790
 new together and levels and so new ways 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.400
 more diverse is the whole then 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.979
 extremely simple puzzles short 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.150
 climbing inlays and of course character 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.979
 Specific action points are the latter 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.720
 with the main game elements because 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.509
 Lego Marvel Super Hero It offers over 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.300
 100 characters all very own 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.619
 Skills have a mission becomes us 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.360
 usually a hero team from two to 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.509
 put together five characters 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.830
 between which we would have to switch freely 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.080
 They demolish, for example, with mister 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.970
 fantastic the billboards and rich 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.100
 she with spider men around us 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 then easily run over it 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 the whole world is full of such 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.030
 action points and many bonuses too 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.820
 Spaces only open with certain ones 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 For example , we can do figures like that 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.440
 golden now hopes the first bother if 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.630
 we all people from 42 suit 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 we have really unlocked everything 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.260
 So you want to discover collect needs to 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.750
 which are the corresponding figures 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 scored once again that 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 increases the replay value much too 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 There is also free to discover 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 walk-in manhattan typical openworld 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.800
 employment as with cars the city 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.160
 demolishing passers-by for no reason 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.200
 drive race 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.260
 and of course as befits one 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 Genuine superheroes are heard Monday 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.340
 certificates to 1 for all understood 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.350
 we also do collectibles for secondary tasks 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.240
 like golden lego blocks and playable ones 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.260
 figures free 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.120
 Unfortunately, many differ 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.860
 side quests playfully barely 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.780
 if we return the trading card to 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.670
 collectors bring or monkeys to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:09.880
 Showers are the requirements 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:11.470
 We always had more difference 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.810
 fight on the left as well 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.700
 Although the character selection is this and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.470
 has various super powers and fighting games 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.240
 where we quickly become a favorite 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.270
 however , many find themselves in 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.580
 characters to be worth about at spider man 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.240
 and scania is hardly a playful one 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.190
 difference 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.080
 this could just be the last two 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.030
 with their tempo mend in the 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.340
 Some of us have more on it than 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.340
 in similar it is with all 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
 man and the human torch of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.670
 greenpeace and and and and pity 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.110
 therefore makes a pool of 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.110
 super powers not less fun 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.959
 as in any lego game we are allowed to play as well 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.250
 in magically prevent basket play 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.400
 even if the dynamic splitscreen 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.810
 a long time while he is still 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.190
 we also need getting used to 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.930
 still only 23 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.720
 pity because often we are with two 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.720
 three or bumbling characters on the way 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.830
 marvel super hero relies on the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.319
 usual cookie damage is 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.849
 knallbunt and make full details 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.160
 Lately I have been wearing clothes at the 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.919
 lego row is striking that always 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.630
 less actually consists of lego 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.160
 Houses are mostly not out 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.720
 place and plant 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.800
 even between lego and not lego 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.330
 differentiated trees 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.120
 the one we can destroy the one 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.190
 others just do not annoy smaller ones 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.900
 bugs and jerks are hardly noticeable 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.479
 Much worse is the German 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.810
 speech output there are all the speakers very much 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.520
 Well 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.950
 however, many are extreme 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.690
 unfit for luck to the more appropriate 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.700
 English speech with on the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.590
 The disc will now be on both of my 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.300
 spoke so flat that even the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.060
 amazing spiderman from the template 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.490
 embarrassed would turn away toni 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.720
 you will be okay 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.720
 euro and more 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.729
 with its many allusions is the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.310
 lego trip into the marvel universe 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.050
 highlight for every comic fans though 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.240
 It sometimes bothers for license reasons 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.800
 both film and comics designs for 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 the characters are used 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.300
 a uniform comic picture would have us 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.349
 better here 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.169
 nonetheless, that makes superheroes 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.909
 adventure crazy fun lying 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.860
 figures through the huge manhattan 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.750
 cost heap scratch in search 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.759
 after nebenquest to jets us 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.800
 feeling of freedom of which also the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:32.539
 colleagues from the lego dc universe still 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.539
 could cut off a slice
