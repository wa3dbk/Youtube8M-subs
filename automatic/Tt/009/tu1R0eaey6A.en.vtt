00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.040

 to be married here in the 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.000
 Turkish community and she actually 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.110
 do not speak german yet and you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.870
 have just not made the bill 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.910
 with the slightly racist alien 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.830
 headmaster played by christoph maria 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.080
 autumn that demands and so on 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.940
 they have to be relatively quick on the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.949
 Legs make the ladies German 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.329

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.100
 and how christoph maria autumn again 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.520

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.489
 and now why take care of the new goods 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 What was the woman from Anatolia leave 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.980
 by proxy in turkey 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.180
 marry unchanged at us 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 how the enemy troops are 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.410
 family reunification and completely legal 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.670
 with a politically correct example 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.579
 must finally appear the kanaken 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.969
 put a stop 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.680
 you have to love your pearls these 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.420
 Women are allowed only with a valid and 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.339
 passed language test in our country 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.339
 you speak German 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 i lose face before whole 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.210
 community the woman 300 wanted to go through 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.530
 speak i can help the basics 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.170
 they want German grammar 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:26.579
 one week is ours 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.579
 relationship started wrong 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.979
 we are the spearhead of the occident 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:42.310
 you have to wait for him but women belong 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.229
 without a kerchief so kiss my 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.420
 father kills me so first she and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.659
 then we do not need only 1 and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.840
 the exam task is bribery 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.659
 was so great one makes my life richer 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.129
 Maybe we have to do that fresh 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.000
 battle is lost but the war 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.000
 not yet 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.120
 migration was my authority here completely 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:16.470
 I also wrote that big 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 you do not because she's hot as me 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.420
 what does he mean by those damned ones 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.860
 did german-turkish culture clash 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.390
 comedy has the last years yes 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 actually important traditions 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.590
 Here too, this narrow ridge 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.880
 it is on one go 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.530
 a comedy we make ourselves 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.730
 make fun of Turks 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.130
 funny we are prejudices 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.410
 from the two opposite the others 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.150
 just funny and besides we have 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.830
 also a political message that we 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.930
 want to pack and that just is not in 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.820
 you still know a serious drama 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.320
 is obvious but let us 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.730
 but a little bit about the problems 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.920
 smile and laugh that makes 300 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
 German words really neat and on 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.020
 some just put both in these 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.530
 current context fits then too 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.910
 charlie hebdo islamism and the bad guys 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.860
 muslim is of course total bullshit 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.540
 is and that's what the film often does 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.920
 very sympathetic way to the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.020
 point that both sides theirs 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 weaken but have their strengths and 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.239
 shows a colorful everyday picture of the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.230
 German Turkish friendship and that 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.280
 I like it a lot 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.810
 because the acting performances 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.180
 are also more than neat christoph 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.950
 maria herbst simply the biggest again 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.850
 asshole often makes this planet the power 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.530
 he really good 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.480
 christoph letkowski does his thing 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.180
 as a nephew, more than strong and you 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.940
 can understand the first one 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.980
 side of this somewhat insecure nephew and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.200
 also official type is at the same time however 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.780
 Also why then ours 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.670
 Main actress with him very well 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.080
 understands must be so pegah 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.019
 ferydoni who know from Turkish for 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.560
 This is also a very good choice for beginners 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.360
 the role 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.209
 she just manages it once 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.160
 this slightly dramatic corner is good too 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.620
 but also play this comedy 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.019
 It is reasonable to place elements 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.170
 but never somehow slapstick it 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.100
 is always a very charming one 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.019
 charming thing it is not quite so 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.970
 strong as for example miss you club and 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.910
 his daughters also from france in 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.680
 but this culture clash rail shoots 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.030
 I honestly have to say that is one 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.579
 beautiful compares or 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.979
 German-Turkish molli claude not 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.840
 quite so good jokes and unfortunately against 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.310
 end also reports quickly so one 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 think oh dear you can do it all now 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.710
 still telling out why is all at once 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.690
 the film is over 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.360
 Overall, but more than worth watching 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.710
 cinema with a nice sound spot 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.020
 backdrops i am always happy when 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.729
 i also cologne on tv the dom and 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.229
 all other corners are captured 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.500
 even if you then determine moment 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.120
 times 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.860
 but straight direction airport loud 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.949
 history is experiencing just the wrong 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.569
 Of course, direction must be in the picture 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.789
 I very much that we see too 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.120
 7 out of 10 points do not like such movies 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.129
 and at the current time just with the pi 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.770
 the thing is a nice statement that 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.689
 I should also like to support her 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.370
 whoever always says okay now 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:00.110
 I definitely know something in the cinema 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.360
 but I would like to have one more 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.849
 a bit more feed then results though 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.669
 you now again ne follow movie facts 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.710
 I link these links below and 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.830
 something no solution namely a films 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.819
 with sex in the seats for the man 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.379
 You must have seen it down here 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.360
 right and we'll meet again 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.930
 at 19 review here at the film factory 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.930
 with me
