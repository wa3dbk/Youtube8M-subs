00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
I used half-inch PVC piping with I don't

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.419 
I used half-inch PVC piping with I don't
know<00:00:52.339> what<00:00:52.550> these<00:00:52.789> are<00:00:52.850> called<00:00:53.030> exactly<00:00:53.960> I

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
think they're elbows I believe but

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.000 
think they're elbows I believe but
there's<00:00:58.640> one<00:01:00.309> there's<00:01:01.309> two<00:01:02.859> there's<00:01:03.859> three

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
there's one there's two there's three

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.430 
there's one there's two there's three
and<00:01:04.640> then<00:01:05.300> there's<00:01:05.510> four<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.170> main<00:01:06.410> unit

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
and then there's four on the main unit

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.690 
and then there's four on the main unit
it<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:07.750> 29<00:01:08.750> inches<00:01:10.030> wide<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:12.910> 22<00:01:13.910> inches<00:01:14.270> high

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
it is 29 inches wide and 22 inches high

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.670 
it is 29 inches wide and 22 inches high
and<00:01:16.700> what<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.940> have<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.180> do<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:18.410> you<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.620> to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and what you have to do is you have to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.150 
and what you have to do is you have to
cut<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.460> bottom<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.210> half<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.130> then<00:01:22.130> put

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
cut this bottom one in half and then put

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.140 
cut this bottom one in half and then put
on<00:01:22.490> your<00:01:24.220> again<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.460> don't<00:01:25.550> know<00:01:25.730> what<00:01:25.910> that's

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.210 
on your again I don't know what that's
called<00:01:27.580> tea<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.790> guess<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.210> tea<00:01:30.010> put<00:01:31.010> on<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
tea and that tea connects to this piece

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.690 
tea and that tea connects to this piece
right<00:01:35.120> here<00:01:35.620> which<00:01:36.620> is<00:01:36.770> connected<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.250> another

right here which is connected to another

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.960 
right here which is connected to another
elbow<00:01:38.590> which<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.740> connected<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.640> unit

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
elbow which is connected to the unit

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.400

different
and<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.170> see<00:02:16.349> it's<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:17.430> higher<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and as you can see it's it's higher and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.369 
and as you can see it's it's higher and
not<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.739> wide<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.810> down<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
not as wide and it's not down to a

not as wide and it's not down to a
single<00:02:23.390> shop<00:02:24.390> light<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:25.700> used<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.150> big<00:02:27.750> one

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
single shop light I used to be big one

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.380 
single shop light I used to be big one
as<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.440> key<00:02:28.590> light<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.099> use<00:02:29.519> this<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.180> fill

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
as the key light I use this as the fill

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.620 
as the key light I use this as the fill
light<00:02:32.900> same<00:02:33.900> basic<00:02:34.290> design<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.269> little

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
light same basic design just a little

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.380 
light same basic design just a little
bit<00:02:36.750> different<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.319> finally<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.489> my

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
bit different and finally this is my

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.650 
bit different and finally this is my
mini<00:02:39.660> light<00:02:39.989> diffuser<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.970> lot<00:02:41.970> simpler<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.540> its

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
mini light diffuser a lot simpler in its

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.039 
mini light diffuser a lot simpler in its
design<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.790> basically<00:02:44.790> use<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.209> for<00:02:45.989> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
design I basically use it for the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.360 
design I basically use it for the
backlight<00:02:46.530> which<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.760> another<00:02:48.090> shop<00:02:48.390> light

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
backlight which is another shop light

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370 
backlight which is another shop light
and<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.849> just<00:02:51.120> goes<00:02:51.870> over<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.349> top

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and it kind of just goes over the top

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.289 
and it kind of just goes over the top
let's<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.489> what<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.819> light<00:02:54.000> looks<00:02:54.030> like

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
let's see what the light looks like

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.240 
let's see what the light looks like
without<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.959> diffusers<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.069> see

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
without the diffusers on as you can see

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.690 
without the diffusers on as you can see
the<00:02:56.489> light<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.730> much<00:02:57.450> harsher<00:02:58.579> without<00:02:59.579> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the light is much harsher without the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.660 
the light is much harsher without the
diffusers<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.620> whoa<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.040> whoa<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.430> doesn't

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
diffusers on whoa and whoa so it doesn't

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.670 
diffusers on whoa and whoa so it doesn't
make<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> difference<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.690> diffusers<00:03:07.319> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
make a difference with the diffusers and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800 
make a difference with the diffusers and
your<00:03:08.640> lighting<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.120> your<00:03:09.269> scene<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> your

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
your lighting of your scene of your

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.130 
your lighting of your scene of your
movie<00:03:10.170> video<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:10.950> whatever
