00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
code so it's not like they've made it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000

interface breaking it because all your
all<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.170> is<00:04:46.350> basically<00:04:46.740> an<00:04:46.860> HTML<00:04:47.400> comment

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
all it is is basically an HTML comment

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.930 
all it is is basically an HTML comment
and<00:04:48.060> then<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.990> can<00:04:49.200> actually<00:04:49.610> flip<00:04:50.610> between

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
and then you can actually flip between

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.460 
and then you can actually flip between
multiple<00:04:51.420> shows<00:04:51.660> which<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.050> something<00:04:52.320> you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
multiple shows which is something you

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.070 
multiple shows which is something you
cannot<00:04:52.740> do<00:04:53.010> with<00:04:53.550> simply<00:04:54.210> copy<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.570> paste<00:04:54.870> in

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
cannot do with simply copy and paste in

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.110 
cannot do with simply copy and paste in
the<00:04:55.110> Ustream<00:04:55.500> code<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.370> that's<00:04:56.490> simply<00:04:56.940> what

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
the Ustream code so that's simply what

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.510 
the Ustream code so that's simply what
it<00:04:57.240> does<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:58.020> blog<00:04:58.320> hasn't<00:04:59.070> been<00:04:59.160> updated<00:04:59.280> a

it does this blog hasn't been updated a

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.500 
it does this blog hasn't been updated a
little<00:04:59.670> bit<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.850> time<00:05:00.060> but<00:05:00.270> I'm<00:05:00.360> simply

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
little bit of time but I'm simply

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.930 
little bit of time but I'm simply
demonstrating<00:05:01.170> use<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.160> live<00:05:02.430> desk<00:05:02.670> cam

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
demonstrating use of the live desk cam

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.080 
demonstrating use of the live desk cam
from<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.300> stream<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:04.400> that<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.850> plugin

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
from you stream and that is the plugin

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.150 
from you stream and that is the plugin
so<00:05:06.390> if<00:05:06.510> you'd<00:05:06.630> like<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.900> get<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.290> go<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.740> PCM

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
so if you'd like to get that go to PCM
