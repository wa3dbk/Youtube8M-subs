only ingredients that are different are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.649 
only ingredients that are different are
the<00:01:08.400> ingredients<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> capsule

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
like the gelatin and so like that so I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.740 
benefits of probiotics in your system
because<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:25.280> medicine<00:01:26.280> wipes<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
because the medicine wipes out all the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.690 
because the medicine wipes out all the
good<00:01:27.869> stuff<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.680> intestines<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
good stuff that's in your intestines and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
good stuff that's in your intestines and
stuff<00:01:29.880> -<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> yeast<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.680> puts

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
stuff - so this is a yeast that puts

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
stuff - so this is a yeast that puts
back<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> good<00:01:32.549> stuff<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.329> get

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
back all the good stuff so you don't get

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
back all the good stuff so you don't get
yeast<00:01:33.840> infections<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> don't<00:01:34.829> have

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
yeast infections and you don't have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.010 
yeast infections and you don't have
diarrhea<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.119> much<00:01:36.329> especially<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.900> little

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
diarrhea as much especially the little

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
diarrhea as much especially the little
ones<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.130> dehydrated<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
ones because they can get dehydrated and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
ones because they can get dehydrated and
stuff<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:39.960> um<00:01:40.250> your<00:01:41.250> applesauce

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
stuff so you can put um your applesauce

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
stuff so you can put um your applesauce
or<00:01:41.790> yogurt<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.509> thing<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.810> stir<00:01:43.049> it

or yogurt in a little thing and stir it
up<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.950> them<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.220> eat<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> whole

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
up and then have them just eat the whole

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
up and then have them just eat the whole
thing<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.680> ahead<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
thing but I like to just go ahead and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.580 
thing but I like to just go ahead and
use<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> syringe<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:48.270> kids<00:01:48.540> um<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.350> kids

it up and then put in the rest of your
medicine<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:12.000> read<00:03:12.180> right<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.480> there

what<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.990> milligram<00:03:13.470> egde<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.840> you

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
what the milligram egde is so and if you

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.100 
what the milligram egde is so and if you
feel<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:17.390> can<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.720> stir<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.020> up

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
feel like it can kind of stir it up

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.220 
feel like it can kind of stir it up
again<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.620> doesn't<00:03:19.860> stick<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> side

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
again so it doesn't stick to the side

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.670 
again so it doesn't stick to the side
anyways<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.130> then<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:24.230> always<00:03:25.230> try<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.530> get<00:03:25.650> a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
anyways so then I always try and get a

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.340 
anyways so then I always try and get a
big<00:03:25.920> syringe<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.090> there's<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> little<00:03:28.230> bit

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
big syringe so that there's a little bit

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.620 
big syringe so that there's a little bit
of<00:03:28.380> air<00:03:28.590> at<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.920> top<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.090> when<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.420> put

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
of air at the top so that when you put

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.560 
of air at the top so that when you put
the<00:03:30.750> little<00:03:30.930> plunger<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.270> doesn't

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
the little plunger in that it doesn't

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.080 
the little plunger in that it doesn't
like<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.070> burst<00:03:35.310> out<00:03:35.520> on<00:03:35.760> you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
like go and burst out on you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.050 
like go and burst out on you
it<00:03:36.270> already<00:03:36.420> did<00:03:36.630> force<00:03:36.900> out<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.110> little<00:03:37.380> bit

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it already did force out a little bit

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.840 
it already did force out a little bit
anyways<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:40.440> gonna<00:03:40.709> probably<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.820> a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
anyways so it's gonna probably do a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.640 
anyways so it's gonna probably do a
little<00:03:42.030> bit<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.050> getting<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.500> air

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
little bit that you're getting the air

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.000 
little bit that you're getting the air
out<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:45.650> then<00:03:48.080> yeah<00:03:49.080> sure<00:03:49.110> that's<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
out and then yeah sure that's the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.780 
out and then yeah sure that's the
correct<00:03:50.400> dose<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:52.100> swipe<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.280> or<00:03:53.520> give<00:03:53.700> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
