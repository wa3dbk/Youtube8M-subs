00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:20.939
 again a new video to what I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 and they return with a new one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.189
 video 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.189
 I don't know what to do 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 the wash water almost comes out of it is it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.030
 All I can talk about but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.420
 I don't want to talk about it at all 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 she leaves late for 1000 live I wanted 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.710
 do that also just see if I can do 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 I also simply improve competitively 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 set so yes do your best and then now 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.809
 they also welcome the video back to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 another new video from me got it up 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.960
 today silico duty ghost game planning 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 you probably wonder what 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.829
 boxes this game that have never seen 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
 on the comics this is really maybe 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.859
 been once and paul vincent together 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.410
 coach have played 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.600
 but it is a very nice game what 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.220
 I learn it 's cup cake but it's the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 latest call of duty but did say 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 from black and i thought well if i really 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 want to respond then I need culture 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 tico's going to do because as the newest 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 call of duty so probably there 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.009
 also most the same in that it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 and that french 12 will be there so I am 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.130
 going to play a little I was not whole 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 good with that and i have to say it plays 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.250
 else goes very fast death is so 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.979
 so that is annoying but good the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 gameplay is anything from 33 to 20 or something 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.009
 it's not great 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.119
 but I didn't need an epic game play 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.540
 wants to go a few things today 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.979
 ask you the first of these 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.210
 would you like it if i'm a single 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.070
 player let's play is going to do it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.369
 channel of the Germans from at battle 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.110
 fair I have not yet requested this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.970
 of course you can find this on me 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.259
 well these are my two uploads' in week 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.729
 so I think I can decide for myself 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.899
 what exactly I am going to do 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.369
 of course you have to approve 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.990
 but I think that can be fun 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.020
 want to join some sinia or 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.329
 the Netherlands just behind in the comments 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 and I seriously ask that and then I want to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.110
 also really come see you had to it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 yes don't do it and everyone does that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.460
 hierarchy if you hear something in the video 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.920
 I have that really terrible then 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.660
 then you are so of hull and up to it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.960
 multi now everywhere again so you know and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070
 also leave it in the back is i have 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.740
 it when i watch a video of it 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.510
 for example lars and he does something whole 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.130
 doms in minecrafte she doesn't know anymore 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.230
 how to make something or something 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.980
 say that about lars then you have to make it that way 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.120
 idiot and that often places him in the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 comments but you have to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.360
 do if you notice something or something 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.650
 sleep well in the comments behind me 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.620
 so like to come see it 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.450
 so yes places behind I would say 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.100
 the second thing I want to talk about today 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.390
 is something that district just whole 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.850
 is wrong for a long time and there is just ff my 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.800
 heart you submit that its that is the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.690
 Albert Heijn and I have been working for a month now 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.030
 or three as a filler at the albert 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.890
 heijn and i think it works great so you 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.450
 does relatively little for what you pay 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.710
 gets with I admit it is so 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.390
 it's neat to be the one 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.740
 I have to say easy earning 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.420
 So if it really for me but la 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.280
 I still irritate me some 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.840
 things and they are really my biggest 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.860
 irritations during work and it is 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.190
 not normal 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.840
 Firstly I am hungry when you are three 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.180
 working hour went break when ours was like 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.650
 four hours of work I have a break and if you do 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.950
 three hours in a row and you work 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.790
 starts at 5 pm and you have to 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 your food at 4 o'clock 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.050
 because i need about half an hour and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 45 minutes cycling there then get 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.860
 I forced half past six at six and then 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.820
 therefore still needs an hour and a half so that will 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.190
 real pussy 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.770
 the second where i really this is really not 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.610
 normally hate thereto which have been 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.990
 terribly high 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.510
 I don't know if it's a known term 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.490
 heavy for your first in first out 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.900
 understands that you mean everything 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.820
 with an expiration date that really 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.960
 maybe only a maximum of two to three weeks 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.550
 is 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.030
 vivo has to fill and so you have to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.620
 everything was there in the first draw 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.200
 then you need everything that is new 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.030
 put on the back of the shelf and then you have to 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.680
 everything you have not taken out 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.720
 put it back so that is real 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.230
 a terrible thing and the mother of bee 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.150
 dairy with cheese with juices with meat that 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.650
 she signs there you have to fill fifo and 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.930
 that's as story as I can really do 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.700
 not at all and I watched I move too 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.200
 always thinking of why should i be so 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.180
 clumsy why don't you just make it 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.440
 and then people don't get in the way like 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 they fill the boxes while people 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.640
 are shopping and it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 is going much easier is the shelves of 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.079
 open the back 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.729
 you can just blame everything on the 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.139
 is so much easier but it will 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.240
 probably too expensive but so 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.710
 so I guess that's why not 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.590
 being done but well that's something 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.939
 which really makes me worse 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.259
 my further look I have nothing against 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.219
 foreigners seems like you 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.020
 very first say 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.490
 but then you are in a then working in the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.919
 shop and I am in a neighborhood where normal 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.349
 many foreign people live alone 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.810
 why do they have to go abroad? 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.460
 walk speak in the store 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.139
 I mean you are speaking in the Netherlands 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.520
 also please dutch te 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.810
 then they start looking for a loop 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.699
 to something and then they already talk enough 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.259
 we can scroll messy or so know 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.990
 I much what they all say 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.599
 and how do I want to help them if I don't know 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.610
 what language they speak and what they mean 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.710
 I can also be someone again or again after 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.509
 which we were I think at home or something or 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.159
 I know a lot where they came from me 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.900
 who had on a telephone 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.250
 caught everything in google and translate 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.620
 they had shown with the sentence of what 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.150
 they needed it and that it does 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.990
 again nice that I think then it is 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.430
 good pass but and so on and there are 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.229
 of those people too 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.729
 and you only have one full body that 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.169
 thing on which you set a crate once 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.029
 get stuff out so you get easier 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.430
 can fill and then you stand at your brace 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.949
 you put things in it to push even chips 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.740
 or something and then suddenly there is a bag on it 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.599
 your full body and the person who is then too 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.490
 lazy to carry the bag and who thinks of it 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.620
 oh well let me just take that picture 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.849
 putting what you hd is someone with it 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.919
 busy or so it is anyway 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.629
 employees of the albert end is growing 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.339
 nothing or so I know a lot about them all 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.979
 think it is where steam had occasionally 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.719
 okay so they have some 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.039
 meditations that I really work with 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.300
 to the al at the albert heijn but good 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.160
 further tick it is very nice to 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.710
 and it is just 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.060
 same here with youtube i like it 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.920
 very nice to do 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.470
 only that motivation is so great 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.600
 problem occasionally dum dum bam bam such 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.100
 make video on can click this fun 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.740
 can watch a movie or this new one 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.600
 delivery of arrow or the bottle I know 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.120
 you that's fine 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.800
 that is my own motivation problem 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.570
 and that is something i called myself 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.520
 work but also with school time, I 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.500
 I have to make a workbook now and I have 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.360
 already 35 pages 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.160
 design thereof and with assignments 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.720
 done and I am not there alone yet 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.360
 ready and I have my Wednesday 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.830
 presentations from the same subject where it 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.140
 also 10 different products 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.700
 create shapes and also for another 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.200
 box the day after 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.310
 and I really think that 's what the fuck does 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.080
 I stand what is the point 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.570
 why am I actually doing this what am I 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.400
 philosophy is rising and it is 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.320
 very annoying because it makes me be 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.310
 but in such a rut of despondency 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.840
 of it 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.610
 what the fuck am i names and then me 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.630
 hit my ear out more so hear that 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.730
 that you might fall 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.490
 sorry for that I just pick it up like that 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.380
 is it back in my ear in the ear 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.520
 is a nice boy 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.990
 anyway that's where i am today 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.400
 liked about this file 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.990
 to of course take a look at my 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.980
 channel I had asked for it at home 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.480
 longest I know it's as good as 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.650
 is impossible but they are super fat 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.970
 its like make it and leave it 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.110
 of course in the comments if 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.940
 you want to see more of this kind 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.650
 commentaries with that nice start 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.210
 pieces and then I can't wait for 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.530
 the black ferner but a week and 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.669
 then I can start to let them 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.410
 also behind what you think of the 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.820
 let's play the single player on this 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.260
 channel want that you do not want to leave 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.250
 we know and massive the signs again and again 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.250
 let it be heard 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.740
 and now
