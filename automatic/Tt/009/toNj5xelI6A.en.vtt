Eureka zone easy smart tool track system
I<00:00:06.089> picked<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.170> system<00:00:07.589> up<00:00:07.770> with<00:00:08.220> 108<00:00:09.179> inches

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I picked this system up with 108 inches

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.360 
I picked this system up with 108 inches
of<00:00:09.900> track<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:11.790> clamps<00:00:12.300> here

Makita magnesium saw the plywood blade I
picked<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> all<00:00:20.369> up<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:21.000> half<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
picked that all up for about half the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.980 
picked that all up for about half the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
systems to that this comes with the base

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.360 
systems to that this comes with the base
there<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.660> mount<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.100> own<00:00:35.219> saw

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
there that you mount on to your own saw

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.369 
there that you mount on to your own saw
so<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.570> couldn't<00:00:39.899> justify

so for the work I do I couldn't justify

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
so for the work I do I couldn't justify
the<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.309> expensive<00:00:41.640> systems<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.510> got

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the more expensive systems and this got

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.529 
the more expensive systems and this got
very<00:00:43.079> good<00:00:43.170> reviews<00:00:43.710> online<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> decided<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
very good reviews online so I decided to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
online is that with this specific saw

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410 
online is that with this specific saw
comes<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> nice<00:00:52.170> hard<00:00:52.649> case<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.879> once

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
comes with a nice hard case but once

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.950 
comes with a nice hard case but once
you've<00:00:55.010> mounted<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> larger<00:00:56.550> base<00:00:56.960> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you've mounted the larger base that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.709 
you've mounted the larger base that
comes<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> system<00:00:58.680> onto<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.309> saw<00:00:59.719> no

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
comes with the system onto your saw no

comes with the system onto your saw no
longer<00:01:01.020> fits<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> case<00:01:02.719> however<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
longer fits in the case however if you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
longer fits in the case however if you
get<00:01:04.769> yourself<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.339> oscillating<00:01:05.820> tool<00:01:06.439> such<00:01:07.439> as

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
get yourself an oscillating tool such as

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.590 
get yourself an oscillating tool such as
this<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.000> easily<00:01:09.830> cut<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.360> some<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
this you can easily cut out some of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.850 
this you can easily cut out some of the
case<00:01:13.130> these<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.430> pieces<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.860> various

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
case these are my pieces here various

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
case these are my pieces here various
pieces<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> cut<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> case<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
pieces that I cut out of the case and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.980 
pieces that I cut out of the case and
then<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> saw<00:01:23.240> fits<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.840> fine<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
then the saw fits in there just fine and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.920 
then the saw fits in there just fine and
your<00:01:27.990> various<00:01:29.090> accessories<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
your various accessories actually you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
your various accessories actually you
can<00:01:31.140> fit<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> top<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> case<00:01:33.090> quite

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
can fit up in the top of the case quite

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
can fit up in the top of the case quite
nicely<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.640> if<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> had<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> cord<00:01:36.270> wrapped<00:01:36.509> up

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
nicely and if I had the cord wrapped up

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.740 
nicely and if I had the cord wrapped up
yet<00:01:37.110> close<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.860> fine<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.600> could

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
yet close is just fine you could

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
yet close is just fine you could
probably<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.799> yourself<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.340> foam

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
probably get to get yourself some foam

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.170 
probably get to get yourself some foam
and<00:01:42.350> I<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.619> fit<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.310> nicer<00:01:44.729> for

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and I would fit that a little nicer for

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.740 
and I would fit that a little nicer for
my<00:01:45.299> purposes<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.079> works<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.040> fine<00:01:47.750> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
my purposes this works just fine and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
my purposes this works just fine and
this<00:01:48.869> goes<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.380> any<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:49.890> tool

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this goes for any of your other tool

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.389 
this goes for any of your other tool
cases<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.030> some<00:01:51.240> tools<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:52.130> due<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
cases I have some tools that due to the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
cases I have some tools that due to the
nature<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:54.060> never<00:01:54.390> get<00:01:54.600> put<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:54.869> in

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
nature of them never get put back in

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.590 
nature of them never get put back in
their<00:01:55.350> case<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> those<00:01:56.820> cases<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.130> easily

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
their case so those cases you can easily

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
their case so those cases you can easily
hack<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.170> fit<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:01.860> other<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.399> tools

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
and used some epoxy to fit it on there

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.880 
and used some epoxy to fit it on there
and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:40.360> got<00:02:40.660> myself<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:42.150> sump<00:02:43.150> pump

the cost of a shopvac hose and the
various<00:02:51.459> fittings<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.970> needed<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.410> have

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
various fittings I needed here we have

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.470 
various fittings I needed here we have
this<00:02:53.709> fitting<00:02:56.730> friction<00:02:57.730> fits<00:02:57.970> onto<00:02:58.180> there

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480

you've got yourself a dust collection

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.910 
you've got yourself a dust collection
system<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.660> other<00:03:19.810> thing<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.200> did<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.650> built

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
system the other thing I did is built

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.500 
system the other thing I did is built
this<00:03:22.769> simple<00:03:25.739> workbench<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:27.160> by<00:03:27.970> notching

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this simple workbench just by notching

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.849 
this simple workbench just by notching
some<00:03:28.720> two<00:03:28.870> by<00:03:29.019> fours<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.590> fitting<00:03:29.829> them

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
some two by fours and fitting them

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.599 
some two by fours and fitting them
together<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.840> then<00:03:32.019> I<00:03:32.049> also<00:03:32.260> used<00:03:32.680> some<00:03:32.920> L

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
together and then I also used some L

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.050 
together and then I also used some L
brackets<00:03:34.269> in<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.480> corners<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:35.049> stiffen<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.530> up

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
brackets in the corners to stiffen it up

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.770 
brackets in the corners to stiffen it up
so<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.090> whole<00:03:37.840> arrangement<00:03:39.510> cost<00:03:40.510> me

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
so that whole arrangement cost me

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.910 
so that whole arrangement cost me
probably<00:03:40.989> about<00:03:41.319> twelve<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.430> fifteen<00:03:42.579> dollars

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
probably about twelve to fifteen dollars

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.099 
probably about twelve to fifteen dollars
so<00:03:47.370> yeah<00:03:48.370> seems<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.180> be<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> good<00:03:49.510> system<00:03:49.959> I've

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
so yeah seems to be a good system I've

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.039 
so yeah seems to be a good system I've
only<00:03:50.290> made<00:03:50.470> my<00:03:50.680> initial<00:03:51.069> cuts<00:03:51.310> right<00:03:51.519> now<00:03:52.049> to

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
only made my initial cuts right now to

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.870 
only made my initial cuts right now to
trim<00:03:53.349> off<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:55.470> chip<00:03:56.470> resistant<00:03:57.160> edges

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
they're made my initial cuts on some

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.699 
they're made my initial cuts on some

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
waste wood seem to work really nice and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.460 
waste wood seem to work really nice and
smooth<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.340> I'm<00:04:03.459> looking<00:04:03.700> forward<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.470> doing
