farming i will show you how to make one
alright<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.300> idea<00:00:18.390> behind<00:00:18.600> us<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.609> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
alright so the idea behind us as you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.080 
alright so the idea behind us as you
have<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.090> block<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.570> cactus<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.760> then<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
have one block of cactus and then a

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.429 
have one block of cactus and then a
block<00:00:25.369> diagonally<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.730> from<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:28.170> reason

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
block diagonally one up from the reason

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
block diagonally one up from the reason
for<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.510> character<00:00:30.810> screws

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
for that is so when the character screws

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.979 
for that is so when the character screws
and<00:00:31.800> instantly<00:00:32.250> gets<00:00:32.460> brushed<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.270> block

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and instantly gets brushed by this block

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.270 
and instantly gets brushed by this block
next<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.120> drops<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.510> clothes<00:00:36.780> into<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
next to and drops and clothes into the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.130 
next to and drops and clothes into the
war<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> goes<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> collection<00:00:39.809> point

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
war and goes into the collection point

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
war and goes into the collection point
in<00:00:41.270> why<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.329> works<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.070> down

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
in why this works is if you put down

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.750 
in why this works is if you put down
cactus<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.850> needs<00:00:45.800> one<00:00:46.800> block<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.219> space<00:00:47.460> on

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
cactus and needs one block of space on

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
cactus and needs one block of space on
each<00:00:48.270> sides<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> place<00:00:49.559> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
each sides see like you can place it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
each sides see like you can place it
there<00:00:49.800> back<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> place<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.660> into

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
there back in place it here because into

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.380 
there back in place it here because into
a<00:00:52.079> block<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> space<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.160> each<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.120> its<00:00:54.239> four

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
a block of space on each of its four

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.639 
a block of space on each of its four
sides<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.230> essence<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.620> to

port in between I so as soon as the clan
I<00:02:40.750> crow<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:42.250> instantly<00:02:42.700> parsed<00:02:43.000> fall<00:02:43.360> into<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
I crow do instantly parsed fall into the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.240 
I crow do instantly parsed fall into the
war<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:45.340> down<00:02:45.520> here<00:02:46.650> also<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.950> would<00:02:48.070> have

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
war and go down here also you would have

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.640 
war and go down here also you would have
more<00:02:48.489> war<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:49.420> each<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.930> these<00:02:50.050> sites<00:02:50.320> than

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
more war on each of these sites than

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.900 
more war on each of these sites than
here<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:52.030> obviously<00:02:52.720> more<00:02:53.110> cacti<00:02:53.620> by<00:02:53.910> that's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
here and obviously more cacti by that's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.220 
here and obviously more cacti by that's
basically<00:02:55.180> how<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.330> works<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.810> can<00:02:55.930> make<00:02:56.080> it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
basically how it works you can make it

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.210 
basically how it works you can make it
more<00:02:56.380> complex<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:57.250> minds<00:02:57.580> I've<00:02:58.150> got<00:02:59.100> made<00:03:00.100> up

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
more complex like minds I've got made up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.300 
more complex like minds I've got made up
a<00:03:00.310> deeper<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.680> passed<00:03:02.680> on<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> site<00:03:03.160> just

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
a deeper and passed on the site just

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.660 
a deeper and passed on the site just
make<00:03:03.580> sure<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.120> get<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.250> cacti<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
make sure I get all of the cacti the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.790 
make sure I get all of the cacti the
drop<00:03:06.970> because<00:03:07.239> sometimes<00:03:07.600> they<00:03:07.780> fall<00:03:07.959> only

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
drop because sometimes they fall only

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.310 
drop because sometimes they fall only
