is watch and in this video I'll be doing

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.019 
is watch and in this video I'll be doing
a<00:00:02.820> flight<00:00:03.179> test<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.600> new<00:00:03.950> DJI<00:00:04.950> phantom<00:00:05.790> 3

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
a flight test of the new DJI phantom 3

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.970 
a flight test of the new DJI phantom 3
professional<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.290> have<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> 4k<00:00:07.680> version

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
professional so we have the 4k version

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.740 
professional so we have the 4k version
of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> new<00:00:08.460> phantom<00:00:08.820> 3<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.330> we're<00:00:09.510> just

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
of the new phantom 3 and we're just

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.570 
of the new phantom 3 and we're just
going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.990> do<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> flight<00:00:10.620> test<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.250> big

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to do a flight test in this big

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
going to do a flight test in this big
open<00:00:12.090> field<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.870> we'll<00:00:13.320> see<00:00:13.469> how<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.769> thing

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
open field so we'll see how this thing

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.650 
open field so we'll see how this thing
handles<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.519> terms<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.000> when<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
handles in terms of when it's up in the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480 
handles in terms of when it's up in the
air<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:16.230> full<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.619> batteries<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.190> should

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
air we're full on batteries so we should

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.220 
air we're full on batteries so we should
be<00:00:17.520> good<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.029> terms<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.630> most<00:00:18.779> things<00:00:18.990> but

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
be good in terms of most things but

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.779 
be good in terms of most things but
without<00:00:19.470> any<00:00:19.560> further<00:00:19.770> ado<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.460> get<00:00:20.609> this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
without any further ado let's get this

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
without any further ado let's get this
thing<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> air<00:00:24.350> okay<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.529> before<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
thing up in the air okay just before you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.050 
thing up in the air okay just before you
take<00:00:26.099> off<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.400> want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.640> sure<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.939> have

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
take off you want to make sure you have

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
take off you want to make sure you have
GPS<00:00:27.480> lock<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.199> drone<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.740> well<00:00:29.220> as

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
GPS lock on your drone as well as

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
GPS lock on your drone as well as
calibrate<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> drone<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.420> you're<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.929> an

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
calibrate the drone if you're in an

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.110 
calibrate the drone if you're in an
unfamiliar<00:00:31.619> area<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> typically<00:00:32.910> don't

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
unfamiliar area that you typically don't

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.060 
unfamiliar area that you typically don't
fly<00:00:33.450> around<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.440> we've<00:00:34.590> done<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
fly around in but we've done that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
fly around in but we've done that
already<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.700> let's<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.000> ahead<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> power<00:00:36.480> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
already so let's go ahead and power this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
already so let's go ahead and power this
thing<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:38.450> okay<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.870> we'll<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.820> lift

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
thing up okay and then we'll just lift

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.320 
thing up okay and then we'll just lift
it<00:00:41.940> up

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.350 

and<00:00:51.330> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.630> see<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.320> there

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
and you can see me right there

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.930 
and you can see me right there
and<00:00:54.360> let's<00:00:54.510> go<00:00:54.690> straight<00:00:55.020> up<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.790> cool

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and let's go straight up so the cool

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.310 
and let's go straight up so the cool
thing<00:01:02.970> about<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.390> new<00:01:03.510> phantom<00:01:03.870> three

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
thing about the new phantom three

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.700 
thing about the new phantom three
professionals<00:01:05.010> were<00:01:05.220> recording<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.110> 4k<00:01:07.110> which

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
professionals were recording in 4k which

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100 
professionals were recording in 4k which
is<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.130> similar<00:01:08.490> video<00:01:08.880> quality<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is very similar video quality to the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160 
is very similar video quality to the
inspire<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.840> careful

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
inspire one and I want to be careful

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
inspire one and I want to be careful
over<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> decent

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
over here because there is a decent

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.140 
over here because there is a decent
amount<00:01:14.730> of<00:01:14.850> crosswinds<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.610> day<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.940> not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
amount of crosswinds but the day is not

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
amount of crosswinds but the day is not
too<00:01:18.450> bad<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.690> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.110> cloudy<00:01:19.410> as<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
too bad a little bit cloudy as you can

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
too bad a little bit cloudy as you can
see<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.960> Southern<00:01:21.960> BC<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
see here in Southern BC this is just a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.280 
see here in Southern BC this is just a
big<00:01:26.100> giant<00:01:26.340> park<00:01:26.760> that<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.780> over<00:01:28.050> here

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
big giant park that we have over here

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.880 
big giant park that we have over here
it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.570> pretty<00:01:30.750> expansive<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's a you can see pretty expansive so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's a you can see pretty expansive so
this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> great<00:01:32.520> place<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.850> fly<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.510> not

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this is a great place to fly there's not

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.859 
this is a great place to fly there's not
a<00:01:33.660> lot<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> people<00:01:34.229> around<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.509> let's<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.720> out

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
a lot of people around and let's go out

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:46.430 
a lot of people around and let's go out
exploring<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> drone<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.020> terms<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> how

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
exploring so the drone in terms of how

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.580 
exploring so the drone in terms of how
it<00:01:46.560> flies<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:47.040> very<00:01:47.250> responsive<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:51.590> really

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it flies it very responsive and really

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
it flies it very responsive and really
really<00:01:52.830> easy<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.250> fly<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.550> you've<00:01:53.730> ever<00:01:53.909> flown

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
really easy to fly if you've ever flown

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.899 
really easy to fly if you've ever flown
like<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.950> phantom<00:01:55.950> drone<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.370> flies<00:01:56.670> very

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
like a phantom drone it flies very

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
like a phantom drone it flies very
similar<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.540> any<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.080> those<00:01:58.170> ones<00:01:58.620> that<00:01:58.800> you've

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
similar to any of those ones that you've

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
similar to any of those ones that you've
experienced<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.820> it's<00:01:59.970> really<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
experienced but it's really really

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.180 
experienced but it's really really
smooth<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.350> designed<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.830> be<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
smooth it's really designed to be like a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.550 
smooth it's really designed to be like a
camera<00:02:02.670> carrying<00:02:03.090> platform<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.170> gimbal

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
camera carrying platform so the gimbal

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340 
camera carrying platform so the gimbal
is<00:02:04.590> extremely<00:02:05.220> nice<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.670> controls<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.350> super

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is extremely nice the controls are super

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
is extremely nice the controls are super
refined<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.209> obviously<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> camera<00:02:09.570> quality

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
refined and obviously the camera quality

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.160 
refined and obviously the camera quality
has<00:02:10.410> been<00:02:10.970> significantly<00:02:11.970> upgraded<00:02:12.239> from<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
has been significantly upgraded from the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:23.430 
has been significantly upgraded from the
phantom<00:02:13.590> 2<00:02:13.620> Vision+<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.360> saw<00:02:15.570> last<00:02:15.840> year

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.350 

now<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.500> range<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.310> phantom<00:02:25.910> three<00:02:26.180> is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
now the range on the phantom three is

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.770 
now the range on the phantom three is
about<00:02:26.660> two<00:02:27.170> kilometers<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.420> that's<00:02:29.420> plenty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
about two kilometers and that's plenty

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.200 
about two kilometers and that's plenty
for<00:02:30.140> most<00:02:30.590> people<00:02:30.890> obviously<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.760> can<00:02:31.910> modify

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
for most people obviously you can modify

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.820 
for most people obviously you can modify
it<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.510> get<00:02:32.660> more<00:02:32.840> range<00:02:33.170> out<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.560> but<00:02:33.680> out

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
it to get more range out of it but out

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.260 
it to get more range out of it but out
of<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.010> box<00:02:34.160> that's<00:02:34.550> more<00:02:34.790> than<00:02:34.940> uh<00:02:35.000> for<00:02:35.180> me

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
of the box that's more than uh for me

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.580 
of the box that's more than uh for me
obviously<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.140> want<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.380> be<00:02:36.470> in

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
obviously you want to be in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.100 
obviously you want to be in
line-of-sight<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:38.660> always<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.020> of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
line-of-sight and you always kind of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.570 
line-of-sight and you always kind of
want<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> look<00:02:39.620> at<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.890> drone<00:02:40.160> while<00:02:40.340> you're

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
want to look at the drone while you're

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
want to look at the drone while you're
flying<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.930> really<00:02:42.140> great<00:02:42.380> thing<00:02:42.620> about

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
flying then the really great thing about

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.350 
flying then the really great thing about
the<00:02:42.950> new<00:02:43.070> phantom<00:02:43.400> 3<00:02:43.580> it's<00:02:43.700> using<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> light

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
the new phantom 3 it's using the light

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.220 
the new phantom 3 it's using the light
bridge<00:02:44.540> technology<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.900> video<00:02:47.900> quality

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
bridge technology so the video quality

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.020 
bridge technology so the video quality
they<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.530> from<00:02:48.770> your<00:02:48.920> smartphone<00:02:49.790> or<00:02:49.820> tablet

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
they get from your smartphone or tablet

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.650 
they get from your smartphone or tablet
is<00:02:50.830> extremely<00:02:51.830> nice<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.220> pretty<00:02:53.030> minimal<00:02:53.480> in

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
is extremely nice and pretty minimal in

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.840 
is extremely nice and pretty minimal in
terms<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:54.080> any<00:02:54.230> kind<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.530> latency<00:02:54.890> I'm<00:02:55.220> getting

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
terms of any kind of latency I'm getting

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.650 
terms of any kind of latency I'm getting
about<00:02:56.050> 720p<00:02:57.050> video<00:02:57.410> at<00:02:57.760> 60fps<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.390> obviously

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
about 720p video at 60fps and obviously

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.700 
about 720p video at 60fps and obviously
the<00:02:59.780> further<00:03:00.020> you<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.470> more<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:03.500> worse

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
the further you go the more the worse

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.610 
the further you go the more the worse
the<00:03:04.100> quality<00:03:04.310> gets<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.930> thing<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.260> always

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the quality gets the thing that I always

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.770 
the quality gets the thing that I always
struggle<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.430> I'm<00:03:07.940> using<00:03:08.120> my<00:03:08.360> Samsung

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
struggle with is I'm using my Samsung

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.080 
struggle with is I'm using my Samsung
phone<00:03:09.020> which<00:03:09.260> has<00:03:09.500> an<00:03:10.190> OLED<00:03:10.490> screen<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
phone which has an OLED screen and

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.970 
phone which has an OLED screen and
they're<00:03:11.450> always<00:03:11.960> not<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.290> best<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.680> terms<00:03:12.830> of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
they're always not the best in terms of

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.490 
they're always not the best in terms of
brightness<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.520> I'd<00:03:17.450> probably<00:03:18.020> have<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.320> get

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
brightness so I'd probably have to get

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.580 
brightness so I'd probably have to get
some<00:03:18.620> kind<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.830> sunshade<00:03:19.310> for<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.870> or<00:03:20.870> use<00:03:21.440> an

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
some kind of sunshade for it or use an

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.770 
some kind of sunshade for it or use an
iPhone<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.040> course<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:26.239> hopefully<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.690> can

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
iPhone of course but hopefully you can

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.150 
iPhone of course but hopefully you can
see<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.050> video<00:03:27.260> quality<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.590> really<00:03:27.770> good<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
see the video quality is really good the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.300 
see the video quality is really good the
video<00:03:28.400> will<00:03:28.580> be<00:03:28.760> uploaded<00:03:28.970> in<00:03:29.239> 4k<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:31.160> can

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
video will be uploaded in 4k so you can

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.920 
video will be uploaded in 4k so you can
see<00:03:31.520> all<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.850> little<00:03:31.970> details<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.780> things

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
see all the little details and things

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.890 
see all the little details and things
like<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.230> if<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> 4k<00:03:34.190> display<00:03:34.900> it'll

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
like that if you have a 4k display it'll

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.010 
like that if you have a 4k display it'll
look<00:03:36.020> even<00:03:36.170> great<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.530> think<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:38.450> guys<00:03:38.600> can<00:03:38.780> see

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
look even great I think you guys can see

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.540 
look even great I think you guys can see
me<00:03:39.200> I'm<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.650> tiny<00:03:39.920> little<00:03:40.130> speck<00:03:40.520> right

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
me I'm that tiny little speck right

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.420 
me I'm that tiny little speck right
there<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.150> waving<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:42.250> don't<00:03:43.250> know<00:03:43.310> if<00:03:43.370> you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
there just waving I don't know if you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.090 
there just waving I don't know if you
can<00:03:43.550> see<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:47.320> it's<00:03:48.320> pretty<00:03:48.470> awesome<00:03:48.650> flying

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
can see that it's pretty awesome flying

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.400 
can see that it's pretty awesome flying
a<00:03:49.550> drone<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.180> this<00:03:50.420> around<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.290> have

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
a drone like this around you just have

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.650 
a drone like this around you just have
to<00:03:51.530> be<00:03:51.620> careful<00:03:51.980> because<00:03:52.540> it's<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:55.630> $1500<00:03:56.630> in

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
to be careful because it's like $1500 in

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.809 
to be careful because it's like $1500 in
the<00:03:56.989> air<00:03:57.140> so

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.000 

and<00:04:04.569> again<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.140> think<00:04:05.260> line-of-sight<00:04:05.860> is

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and again I think line-of-sight is

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.009 
and again I think line-of-sight is
always<00:04:06.310> important<00:04:06.790> even<00:04:07.480> though<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.719> drone

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
always important even though this drone

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.199 
always important even though this drone
can<00:04:08.200> go<00:04:08.349> far<00:04:08.590> away<00:04:09.060> doesn't<00:04:10.060> mean<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.299> should

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
can go far away doesn't mean you should

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:26.450 
can go far away doesn't mean you should
that<00:04:13.209> is<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.450> course<00:04:13.599> if<00:04:13.780> you're<00:04:13.930> novice

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.080 

as<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.210> can<00:04:27.300> see<00:04:27.949> we<00:04:28.949> got<00:04:29.130> beautiful<00:04:29.340> scenery

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
as you can see we got beautiful scenery

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.469 
as you can see we got beautiful scenery
here<00:04:30.539> over<00:04:30.780> here<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.110> Langley<00:04:32.330> Langley<00:04:33.330> BC

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
here over here in Langley Langley BC

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.999 
here over here in Langley Langley BC
actually<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.110> funny<00:04:34.289> thing<00:04:34.500> is<00:04:34.590> if<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.800> keep

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
actually the funny thing is if I keep

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.969 
actually the funny thing is if I keep
going<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.460> couple<00:04:35.759> of<00:04:35.910> more<00:04:36.800> kilometers<00:04:37.800> I'll

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
going a couple of more kilometers I'll

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.300 
going a couple of more kilometers I'll
being<00:04:38.250> in<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.819> US<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.500> let's<00:04:40.500> turn<00:04:41.039> around

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
being in the US so let's turn around

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
well as a camera that looks at the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.379 
well as a camera that looks at the
downwards<00:05:15.800> position<00:05:16.369> and<00:05:16.610> pretty<00:05:17.149> much<00:05:17.330> just

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
downwards position and pretty much just

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.200 
downwards position and pretty much just
monitors<00:05:18.020> where<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.439> is<00:05:18.589> in<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.369> if<00:05:19.879> you<00:05:20.029> want

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
monitors where it is in and if you want

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.309 
monitors where it is in and if you want
it<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.389> hover<00:05:20.539> there<00:05:20.779> it'll<00:05:20.899> be<00:05:20.960> even<00:05:21.169> more

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
it to hover there it'll be even more

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.909 
it to hover there it'll be even more
accurate<00:05:21.619> than<00:05:22.300> with<00:05:23.300> its<00:05:23.479> GPS<00:05:23.719> so<00:05:24.229> alongside

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
accurate than with its GPS so alongside

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.549 
accurate than with its GPS so alongside
the<00:05:25.309> GPS<00:05:25.879> technology<00:05:26.449> this<00:05:26.960> thing<00:05:27.229> is<00:05:27.349> rock

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:27.559 
the GPS technology this thing is rock

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.219 
the GPS technology this thing is rock
solid<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:28.129> terms<00:05:28.159> of<00:05:28.669> hovering<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:30.080> could

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
solid in terms of hovering you could

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.629 
solid in terms of hovering you could
pretty<00:05:30.379> much<00:05:30.499> keep<00:05:30.860> it<00:05:30.949> there<00:05:31.159> and<00:05:31.279> even<00:05:31.430> with

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
pretty much keep it there and even with

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.969 
pretty much keep it there and even with
violent<00:05:32.180> winds<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:33.020> still<00:05:33.469> does<00:05:33.649> a<00:05:33.680> great<00:05:33.919> job

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
violent winds it still does a great job

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.899 
violent winds it still does a great job
of<00:05:34.550> keeping<00:05:35.419> itself<00:05:35.869> in<00:05:36.080> one<00:05:36.259> area<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.099> here<00:05:37.759> we

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
of keeping itself in one area so here we

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:43.520 
of keeping itself in one area so here we
are<00:05:38.059> coming<00:05:38.300> down<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.539> myself

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.070 

and<00:05:44.040> typically<00:05:44.520> what<00:05:44.670> I<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.090> do<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:46.020> just

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
and typically what I like to do is just

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.450 
and typically what I like to do is just
catch<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.740> drone<00:05:48.170> because<00:05:49.170> I'm<00:05:50.130> not<00:05:50.280> that

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
catch the drone because I'm not that

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.410 
catch the drone because I'm not that
good<00:05:50.520> at<00:05:50.730> landing<00:05:50.940> at<00:05:51.270> this<00:05:51.420> point<00:05:56.420> so

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420
