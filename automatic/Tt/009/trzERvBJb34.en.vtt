00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.400
 I'll wait for you later ..... 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.300
 Faces, faces, faces 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.340
 always smiling 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.400
 but without a soul! 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.420
 Faces, faces, faces 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 so funny 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 but lost in the void 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.600
 that surrounds them! 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.060
 All, all, all 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.260
 compliant actors 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.100
 plastic puppets! 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.440
 A thousand, a thousand, a thousand 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.700
 winning roles 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.480
 the "Great Comedy" 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.220
 hypocrisy! 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.980
 RIT: Distorted reality 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.180
 conceived in half 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.800
 that will drown us 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
 in the World of Masks ... 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 Heads, heads, heads 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.520
 empty and overbearing 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.380
 ignore reality! 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.420
 Looks, looks, looks 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.820
 beautiful and fascinating 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.340
 but they fear the signs 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 of time passing! 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.820
 Many, many, many 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.320
 flashy stars 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.120
 the mirrors of all 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.140
 too many, too many, too many 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 persistent lies 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.100
 ... but it's all part 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.180
 of an ideal world! 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 RIT: Distorted reality 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.120
 conceived in half 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.040
 that will drown us 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.500
 in the World of Masks ... 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.940
 .... is a world of masks ... 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.200
 RIT: Distorted reality 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.260
 conceived in half 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.900
 that will drown us 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.320
 in the World of Masks ... 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 (repeats refrain) 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.480
 is a world of masks ... 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.940
 WORLD OF MASKS - Simple Strangers
