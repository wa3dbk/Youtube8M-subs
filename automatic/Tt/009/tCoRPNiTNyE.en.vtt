hi<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.190> I'm<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.850> you

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.220 
hi in this video I'm going to show you
the<00:00:03.060> difference<00:00:03.449> between<00:00:03.840> three<00:00:04.200> different

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
the difference between three different

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.110 
the difference between three different
billing<00:00:04.710> systems<00:00:05.130> using<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.609> elevator

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
billing systems using this elevator

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.009 
billing systems using this elevator
growth<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:07.400> in<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.580> prototype<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
growth of a in this prototype we have a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.500 
growth of a in this prototype we have a
cabin<00:00:11.929> came<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:14.870> different<00:00:15.870> release<00:00:17.510> we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
cabin came to a different release we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.870 
cabin came to a different release we
also<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.900> three<00:00:19.490> different<00:00:20.490> lengths<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
also have three different lengths of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660 
also have three different lengths of
rope<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> long<00:00:21.869> road<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.460> medium<00:00:23.460> rope

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
rope we have a long road a medium rope

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.650 
rope we have a long road a medium rope
and<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.090> short<00:00:24.359> rope<00:00:25.160> on<00:00:26.160> si<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.359> prototype

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and a short rope on si to the prototype

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.689 
and a short rope on si to the prototype
we've<00:00:28.019> also<00:00:28.260> marked<00:00:28.769> series<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.460> five

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
we've also marked series of five

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.209 
we've also marked series of five
centimeter<00:00:30.179> increments<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.890> help<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
centimeter increments this will help to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.530 
centimeter increments this will help to
highlight<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.790> difference<00:00:33.149> between<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
highlight the difference between the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.690 
highlight the difference between the
three<00:00:33.690> Phyllis's<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.890> let's<00:00:35.070> start<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
three Phyllis's so let's start with a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.319 
three Phyllis's so let's start with a
mortgage<00:00:36.300> rule<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.489> with<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> road<00:00:38.940> we

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
mortgage rule and with this road we

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:48.350 
mortgage rule and with this road we
create<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:42.469> term<00:00:44.450> coexistence<00:00:46.610> hold<00:00:47.610> hold

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
create the term coexistence hold hold

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
create the term coexistence hold hold
the<00:00:48.450> three<00:00:48.629> term<00:00:48.840> pulley<00:00:49.050> system<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:50.219> we

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the three term pulley system because we

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.779 
the three term pulley system because we
start<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> top<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.690> mean<00:00:52.079> come<00:00:52.289> rain

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
start at the top here I mean come rain

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:02.840 
start at the top here I mean come rain
once<00:00:56.390> twice<00:01:00.350> three<00:01:01.350> chain<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.800> hiked<00:01:02.609> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
once twice three chain is hiked on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.679 
once twice three chain is hiked on
camera

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.070 

so<00:01:06.689> each<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.350> filling<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> cabin<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:10.020> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
so each I'm filling the cabin is how you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.130 
so each I'm filling the cabin is how you
move<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> vein<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.390> because<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> force

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
move up a vein this is because the force

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
move up a vein this is because the force
required<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> lift<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> cabin<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.790> divided<00:01:15.180> by

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
required to lift the cabin is divided by

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.429 
required to lift the cabin is divided by
five<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.170> between<00:01:19.170> these

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
five and this is because between these

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
five and this is because between these
two<00:01:19.650> police<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.939> five<00:01:21.180> lengths<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
two police there are five lengths of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
two police there are five lengths of
rope<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.740> weight<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> cabin<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
rope and the weight of the cabin is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.980 
rope and the weight of the cabin is
spread<00:01:23.939> equally<00:01:24.390> among<00:01:26.540> attained<00:01:27.540> same<00:01:27.810> with

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
spread equally among attained same with

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
spread equally among attained same with
the<00:01:28.080> three<00:01:28.229> tranquilly<00:01:28.710> system<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the three tranquilly system is that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.719 
the three tranquilly system is that
almost<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.270> easy<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.720> move<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.729> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
almost very easy to move up and down the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
almost very easy to move up and down the
cabin<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> samba<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.869> fine<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.770> actually

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
cabin the samba very fine they actually

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460 
cabin the samba very fine they actually
moves<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.640> bit<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> distance<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
moves a bit of the distance of the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.580 
moves a bit of the distance of the
catering<00:01:38.240> okay<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.720> system<00:01:39.990> when

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
catering okay so with this system when

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100 
catering okay so with this system when
we<00:01:40.710> start<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.060> cotton<00:01:42.570> wheat<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.840> zero

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
we start with the cotton wheat at zero

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.880 
we start with the cotton wheat at zero
on<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> cabin<00:01:43.950> signal<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.420> move<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
on the cabin signal and if we move this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.660 
on the cabin signal and if we move this
all<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> way<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.869> 50<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
all the way down to 50 you can see that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.359 
all the way down to 50 you can see that
the<00:01:50.729> cabin<00:01:51.060> has<00:01:51.210> only<00:01:51.360> moved<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> ten<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:56.189> let's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the cabin has only moved to ten so let's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.980 
the cabin has only moved to ten so let's
move<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> turn<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> system

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
move on to the to turn for the system

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
move on to the to turn for the system
and<00:01:58.409> we'll<00:01:58.649> create<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> using<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> medium

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and we'll create this using the medium

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.490 
and we'll create this using the medium
length<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.689> rope<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> here<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.810> start<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
length of rope so here we start at the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690 
length of rope so here we start at the
pair<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> wait<00:02:05.450> yes

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.339 

it's<00:02:09.879> for<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.090> tutorial<00:02:10.629> system<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.200> we're

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
it's for the tutorial system is we're

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.390 
it's for the tutorial system is we're
going<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.500> come<00:02:11.650> right<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.310> counting<00:02:12.700> once

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.940 

place<00:02:20.489> okay<00:02:21.489> so<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.000> thing<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
place okay so this thing with the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.979 
place okay so this thing with the
two-tone<00:02:24.280> billing<00:02:24.580> system<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.480> cabinet<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.959> a

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
two-tone billing system the cabinet is a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.160 
two-tone billing system the cabinet is a
little<00:02:26.319> bit<00:02:26.410> higher<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.860> noon<00:02:27.870> invest<00:02:28.870> because

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
little bit higher to noon invest because

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.339 
little bit higher to noon invest because
force<00:02:29.860> required<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.280> movie<00:02:30.610> cabin<00:02:30.819> is<00:02:31.269> only<00:02:31.870> to

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
a passenger lift and that's why we use a

exception<00:03:24.359> this<00:03:25.359> is<00:03:25.420> because<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.109> force

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
exception this is because the force

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.809 
exception this is because the force
required<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.769> leave<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> cabin<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.549> only

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
required to leave the cabin is only

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.340 
required to leave the cabin is only
divided<00:03:28.120> by<00:03:28.359> one<00:03:28.630> length<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:29.019> rule<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
divided by one length of rule and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.150 
divided by one length of rule and
therefore<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.370> same<00:03:30.609> force<00:03:32.100> okay<00:03:33.100> so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
therefore it is the same force okay so

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.460 
therefore it is the same force okay so
