 Do you know I understand Led? 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.510
 When I was on the market novelty is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.520
 great when the first video 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 the console has been shown in the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 still the name of the revolution 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.059
 No one understood correctly what I 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 I do not understand what I meant with that and why 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.050
 more than the following months were 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.390
 filled with videos and more videos 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 explanatory some game needed 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 show what exactly that control 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.489
 Did this game have a name is the sport in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 innovations are not so great. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.750
 concluded for example that because I 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 knows tablet already knows control but the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.830
 people know all the possibilities 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.049
 combinations next to the tablet 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.930
 second screen with the other controls 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.720
 the nintendo knows that it is not and if in the wii 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.630
 We had many sports will be here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.460

 lens is the debut title that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.540
 accompanies the video game in the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.729
 linux a black color and if you watch 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.439
 our analysis of the apparatus knows that this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.299
 version you have to run behind 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.790
 the idea is more or less so your name 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.640
 is placed in a gigantic arena where 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.920
 can visit different toys is that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 We can talk, so imagine you in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.229
 Hopi will do anything like this and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.909
 instead of screaming you're done 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.100
 playing a little video game

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.439
 great nintendo franchises and you already 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.530
 can play than with gmar metroids is the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.210
 deficit and much much more 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.009
 besides having a general climate are 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 of the games it is clear that the style itself 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.960
 them based on some present idea 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 original titles that inspire each 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.229
 one of those games so legend of zelda 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.030

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.459
 west puts the player will destroy a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.590
 series of opponents with the bow and arrow 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.480
 while in multiplayer the others 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.319
 accompanying using motion with 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.840
 sword 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.480
 already in capital and falcon conquista de race 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.370
 the tablet should be held vertically 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 the same way you control and 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 steering wheel why not a mario kart game 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 wii you need to spin fast 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.190
 control the main character of the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.079
 franchise is easy by a number of 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.090
 obstacles to reach the end of the race 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.860
 and all of them what left us the most 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.379
 addicted and getting arrested 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.329
 where you can party with five people 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.010
 where I joined asked me and the other four 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 and I love to talk about it, the animal 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.840
 crossing city ​​day where these games where 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.890
 everyone competes for the candy house 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.079

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 Who keeps cleaned up while the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.859
 other was not death are the animals in the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.690
 good sense, right? 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.000
 he is saying that more of his 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.579
 agent and tal donkey kong crash course 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.980
 could well be in the ipad of life and the 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.200
 its perfect execution the player must 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.639
 Claudia prevents in different directions 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.799
 to reach the end of a race 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.359
 obstacles where anything can 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.430
 destroy your cart 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.769
 he was just a fun person 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.169
 happens to more people watching the 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.150
 performance on TV and trying to beat the 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.690
 his personal record that in recent years 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.019
 levels becomes a movement challenge. 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.639
 accurate 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.709
 It's hard for us not to categorize him. 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.130
 eat young because in fact are two 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.560
 games that have multiple games in one 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.819
 but they are well 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.319
 that we find for example in 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.799
 tablets and cell phones 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.630
 only that some of them are large and bring 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.250
 a lot you do as per 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.109
 example of the metroid series 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.359
 but it is still clear that neither 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.310
 land is an introductory title that will be 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.079
 forgotten by the gift of the game so 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.569
 quickly like what happened with 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.879

 enough and get that done 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.299
 and will stay in memory for a while. 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.299
 time 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.900
