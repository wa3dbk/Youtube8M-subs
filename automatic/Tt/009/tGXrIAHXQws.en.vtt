00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.279
 once again to my channel I am kripper and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.019
 we are back in the black ops 2 today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.850
 I bring you a new nuclear in this case 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.530
 using the metal one I come to talk 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.790
 today of a very important subject but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.740
 Well, first of all, we're going to take off 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 in the middle the gameplay theme is worth many 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
 marte you gave variety at the time of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 upload nuclear weapons with weapons 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 different I see it completely normal 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.840
 of order and well I think I am 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.150
 fulfilling enough to the letter I have not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.710
 climbed 2 nuclear with the n 94 one with 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 the yesterday type rise nuclear with the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 scarlett and well then if you have nuclear 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 with the m so good guys the theme of the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.979
 that I have come to talk about today is the topic of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.629
 clan rydex this clan that we created my 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.940
 girlfriend and I a competitive clan that 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.620
 well we are willing to try 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.690
 be between the top and reach what 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.339
 bigger and good as we are looking for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.799
 players guys we are still looking 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.299
 players for this clan reach us 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:49.920
 many requests but for a 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.359
 reason or another we have to discard the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.039
 I will spend a few hours discussing the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.629
 requirements and good then we are 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.179
 quite excited about this topic and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.619
 We would like to get to compete now 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.629
 we still lack people for the staff and 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.579
 we can not compete therefore guys 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.040
 I'm going to pass you I'll move to comment 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
 above the subject of the requirements 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.380
 feeling it a lot and I feel so 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.180
 direct but 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.939
 those who are the players that are not 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.649
 from Spain and have less than 16 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.869
 I can not enter the clan for years 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.240
 go on to comment on why it is not even a topic 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.549
 of racism not much less are we going to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 see people who are not from Spain 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.289
 example or someone who is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 colombia-venezuela south america in general 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.000
 If I ask you to leave, I am Spanish 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.810
 I am far from the departure of the host 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.100
 that person is going to go the connection goes 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.869
 to have a fucking connection going to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.460
 have a point two stripes as very much 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.349
 and that person the fatal vais connection 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.509
 then there is the theme of the 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.159
 events and so on that person can not 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.990
 move to Spain at least so 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.060
 I do not think that for every event 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 Catalan will pay a ticket 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 and leave the pasta to come to a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 advance but I tell you the subject 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 The main one is the country 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.159
 the fatal bayer connection if the fiction 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.869
 it's Spanish because obviously everyone 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.209
 the players of the keys they usually 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.489
 be Spanish at least in the lv and good 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.770
 because the connection theme is very noticeable 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.479
 when we play so 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.829
 that deny those requests not the people 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 that is not from Spain 'feeling it a lot 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.950
 they can not enter isolating then the subject 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.680
 of 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.950
 16 years or younger people who do not have 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.330
 a minimum age of 16 years feeling it 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 a lot also can not enter the clan 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.489
 because I explain it to you is not because if there 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.470
 without mature or we think that to have 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.540
 that age do not know how to play, much less 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.910
 it's more I have one more year I have 17 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.640
 years this year I'm 18 but good 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.769
 the issue is when attending the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 big events and so on if you do not have a 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.970
 minimum age of 16 you can not 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 compete you can not play if you can 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.000
 attend the events you can be by 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.830
 there etcetera but at the time of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 participate, you can not sit down 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.150
 to play at a table for a championship in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.610
 where there is a prize you can not be the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.349
 minimum age that they ask for at events and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.150
 feeling it a lot because those people do not 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.410
 can participate so good if 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 someone thinks that he has some 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.010
 competitive knowledge skill 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.200
 can you contact me via twitter? 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.200

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.720
 I'll leave the twitter of the mine rachel 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.370
 of the clan and skype and so on and well 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.200
 everyone who thinks he has possibilities 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 to enter that he is going to take it seriously 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.819
 as mexico, a man I can throw myself 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.530
 quick so that the bullets do not reach me 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.659
 and well, the truth is that they were 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.040
 quite tense moments and nothing I hope
