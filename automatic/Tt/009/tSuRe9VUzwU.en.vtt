 According to the motto, women are allowed to work up or search yearbook or tofu 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 People also like Trains for Women or Simply 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.719
 it should not really talk about it at all No that 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.210
 is not even 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.310
 to raise the subject at all 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.930
 So who does not know what to put together? 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.720
 Of course more 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.059
 Defago 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.099
 because there is a life after 40 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.279
 and what our mothers and different on the ball all the bestsellers and the beautiful 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.299
 There is always something new about books and readership 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.560
 I am always complaining if you write well enough 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.610
 It remains important for a large readership that young Kamber Koc new 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.470
 in it even my good Schumacher, yes, but only the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.620
 People the rtl show documents the people are ears bookstore i know 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.649
 I do not dare to doubt it 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.369
 but at least that's the way people can not be one 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.150
 noticeable much 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.549
 next to it my books bought at the HAW and if they are 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.009
 different worlds so the theater audience 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.989
 at least that's what brought me the people who came to my place 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.729
 theatre 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:10.839
 these are completely different people he heated the rtl-viewer on the other hand 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.659
 rtl-viewers 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.009
 but then of course my chance »admitted 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.859
 enjoy the media coverage and buy 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:19.949
 the books 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.859
 So my audience comes from all sides and pulls through all 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.030
 Populations at the stern 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.579
 he has in already running movie shows which Magnin can prevail 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.299
 I think in the end you already know how people really are weird 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.790
 can not change the Mannheim Chamber for so long 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.630
 Linger 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.270
 the ladies start and I will easily actress on the July too 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.430
 The stage in which local pieces in the next few years is short and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.889
 easily starts 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.070
 yes that's a real person I represent 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.860

 American artist Fund Foster Jenkins 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.279
 this is not an easy woman who wanted in the mentioned countries, however 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.160
 had no talent at all 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.950
 but because of percent of the night of their money all possibilities 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.780
 have done 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.320
 and then facts big opera houses filtered and on the Carnegie Hold and 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.360
 Their biggest trends, however, are surprisingly made by Caruso Cole 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.160
 porter 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.220
 Mayo West and the Aga Khan 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.680
 because she is such a charismatic person 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.029
 was an eccentric an arrogant is thinking 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.369
 and she was an inspiration to many and a forerunner of the modern as well 

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:30.310
 Art, then, without being the end of the world of the bourgeois 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.500
 Art understanding is a torn one 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.490
 Philip Boy is Cool &amp; Sound Percent Jeff Koons 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.090
 or Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.220

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.569
 thankful he is and that is up 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.099
 choose this is one 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.150
 There are extraordinary performances that make you want to perform 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:04.340

 The country experienced says can call 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.300
 So that there are people who do themselves as an underperformer without the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.629
 To be a master of a certain instrument and that's absolutely her 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.099
 not mastered and unique idea

 January started taking singing lessons 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.039
 that requires a very specific one 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.889
 because extension of voice and vocal technique 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.509
 and finally you should bring the piece for four to six weeks what 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.240
 but very difficult today was in the free scene to the people every 30 years 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.870
 Commitment should not be for majority of the so
