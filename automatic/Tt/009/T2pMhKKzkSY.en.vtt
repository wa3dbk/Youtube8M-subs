00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 hi all, often the body cheeks 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:33.660
 you have to drill rivets that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.250
 some body parts are riveted 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.890
 let's say bumper clips are basically there 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.989
 us volvo bills even protection like this 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.019
 one time when rivet alina rivet on 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.079
 here on the boards they have a maniac such 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.540
 Here at any bumper even 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.460
 there are problems on them from drilling this 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.769
 rivet because when begin 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.699
 drill starts to turn 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.859
 spinning along with the drill kind of it 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.140
 happens because some rivets 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.229
 placed in a plastic sleeve 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.830
 which when heated naturally melts 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.110
 and it starts to turn itself rivet 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.659
 sometimes there is even no sleeve and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.270
 rivet nevertheless turns 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.090
 under in this case here is a rivet here 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.830
 it can be seen hanging out with the bumper and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.950
 it must be drilled of course you can just 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.829
 snatch it but then something already chemically 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.630
 matched well best of all after all 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:34.240
 drill besides this is a rivet she 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.920
 the metal is not aluminum so its 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.229
 drill much harder than usual 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.200
 aluminum which is permissible 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.689
 proposed here here bumper out here he 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.420
 rivet is aluminum it's all nonsense 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.119
 easily and just takes aim as 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 evict this rivet 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.899
 now I'll show you take the usual 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.689
 drill screwdriver no matter what the main thing 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.329
 to drill was more than expected 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.109
 rivet diameter and more somewhere on 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:09.190
 millimeter by 2 even the principle is not 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.709
 so important and start drilling see u 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.200
 us for blood to turns 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.040
 Now I will make you closer 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.040
 made sure of it 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.849
 and so here i am starting that liza is simply not 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:33.890
 spinning how to make it not 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:36.439
 spinning is very simple i just see 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.500
 changed the angle i.e. the angle was 90 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:43.599
 degrees appendicular plane 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.459
 now i took took aside drill and side 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:51.139
 now even if the rivet will be 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.769
 spin it will still be cut off 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.769
 a drill 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.830
 because the drill doesn't just twist 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.650
 rivet a because of the speed difference with 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.330
 this side with in this part of the drill and in 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.550
 this part of the drill still goes 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.230
 small means here you see i 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.890
 Drilled a little bit and already part of the rivet 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.170
 from bored to the same again I draw 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.569
 this metal rivet is very her 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.880
 hard to drill because all the same 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.709
 metal is not aluminum however process 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.709
 goes therefore continue 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.530
 the main thing is not to make a big effort and not 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.310
 allow all the same to spit 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.769
 rivet 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.409
 on its here to such an extent that the beginning 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.090
 plastic melt 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.190
 In this case, I bumper here under 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.470
 I donâ€™t pay much to replace it 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.200
 attention but if you have details of which 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.000
 you track you need to do something 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.000
 break or cool the rivet 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.819
 You see what part of the rivet 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.909
 turned out called on 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:35.990
 Yes, it is clear this time will take more than one 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:38.360
 minute let five minutes five minutes 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.590
 Howl from drill all the same and Alan not 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.590
 let it heat up 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.180
 also the situation and the need complicates the rod 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.560
 exhaust rivets in which rests 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.750
 drill and it turns out that accounts 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.409
 drill and he still he adds to everything 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.719
 on any steel rivets and on 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.960
 aluminum and metal rivets 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.680
 it is steel therefore it is still aggravating 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.550
 the situation 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.289
 but so no less a process can be so 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.400
 to tell 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:20.960
 produce to facilitate 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.960
 whole process try to knock this one out 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.330
 rod inward and it is necessary it succeeds 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.349
 and no need if you fail then 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.349
 will have to drill further 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:05.170
 you see chips dripping and melting about 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:15.810
 that all the same process is slow but 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:21.270
 surely but goes well you can also resort 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.270
 just cool with a wet cloth 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:32.890
 since i did now see everything 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.740
 the result as you say on the face 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.860
 here the rivet really stood here 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.770
 with such plastic and sleeve from which 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.490
 It left only this little thing in 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.430
 As a result, we drilled the bumper and this 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.620
 for us the most important thing 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.260
 so good luck to everyone do not rush to chop 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:57.370
 chisel sweat because you can 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:59.140
 smash hole holes for rivets so 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.520
 that then no other rivet 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.440
 it will be the same as you yet yes if suddenly 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.100
 start working chisel you can 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.490
 to harm 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:13.270
 and most likely damage and plastic itself 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.250
 which at riveting if there was metal at 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.050
 rivet it matters no you can even cut down 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.420
 aluminum rivet but it occurs 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.150
 rarely as a rule 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:26.340
 only plastic is stuck so 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.340
 good luck everyone all bye
