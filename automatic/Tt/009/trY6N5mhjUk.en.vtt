hey<00:00:00.420> what's<00:00:00.599> up<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.810> it's<00:00:00.870> Justin<00:00:01.500> from<00:00:01.650> hip

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hey what's up guys it's Justin from hip

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.990 
hey what's up guys it's Justin from hip
science<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.520> today<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> be

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
science and today we're going to be

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.050 
science and today we're going to be
talking<00:00:03.179> about<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.540> physics<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
talking about the physics of

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.460 
talking about the physics of
skateboarding<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.690> for<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> lot<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.049> people<00:00:07.350> who

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
skateboarding so for a lot of people who

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.620 
skateboarding so for a lot of people who
don't<00:00:07.680> skate<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.280> not<00:00:08.490> exactly<00:00:08.910> clear<00:00:09.480> how

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
don't skate it's not exactly clear how

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
don't skate it's not exactly clear how
skateboarders<00:00:10.500> are<00:00:10.679> able<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.070> do<00:00:11.400> tricks<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
skateboarders are able to do tricks and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.240 
skateboarders are able to do tricks and
leave<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.660> ground<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.380> their<00:00:13.530> skateboards

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
leave the ground with their skateboards

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.099 
leave the ground with their skateboards
still<00:00:14.580> under<00:00:14.910> their<00:00:15.059> feet<00:00:15.330> also<00:00:15.660> off<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
still under their feet also off the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.019 
still under their feet also off the
ground<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.920> clearly<00:00:17.190> not<00:00:17.460> attached<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.789> your

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
ground it's clearly not attached to your

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
ground it's clearly not attached to your
feet<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> snowboard<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> same

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
feet like a snowboard but at the same

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.320 
feet like a snowboard but at the same
time<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.220> can't<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.609> jump<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.240> ground

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
time you can't just jump off the ground

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
time you can't just jump off the ground
and<00:00:21.689> expect<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:22.199> skateboard<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> come<00:00:22.859> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and expect your skateboard to come with

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.359 
and expect your skateboard to come with
you

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
you

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
you
so<00:00:23.550> how<00:00:23.760> exactly<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.539> skateboarders<00:00:25.260> able<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
so how exactly our skateboarders able to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
so how exactly our skateboarders able to
get<00:00:26.099> their<00:00:26.279> skateboard<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.970> leave<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> ground

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
get their skateboard to leave the ground

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
get their skateboard to leave the ground
with<00:00:28.019> their<00:00:28.260> body<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.769> land<00:00:29.250> back<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
with their body and land back at the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
with their body and land back at the
same<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:31.109> imagine<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.769> our<00:00:31.980> reference

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
same time so imagine that our reference

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
same time so imagine that our reference
point<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> center<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.600> mass<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
point is the center of mass which is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
point is the center of mass which is
right<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.829> at<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> center<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> board

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
right here at the center of the board

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.459 
right here at the center of the board
where<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.969> balances<00:00:36.480> that's<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.200> gravity

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
where it balances that's where gravity

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
where it balances that's where gravity
acts<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> order<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> board<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
acts so in order to get the board to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
acts so in order to get the board to
leave<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> ground<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.010> apply<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
leave the ground we have to apply a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.610 
leave the ground we have to apply a
force<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> distance<00:00:42.390> otherwise<00:00:43.200> known<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
force at a distance otherwise known as a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
force at a distance otherwise known as a
torque<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.460> tail<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.329> makes<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> board

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
torque to the tail that makes the board

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.010 
torque to the tail that makes the board
rotate<00:00:46.649> around<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.399> axis<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> rotates

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
rotate around this axis so it rotates

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
rotate around this axis so it rotates
down<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.559> smacks<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> ground<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.420> normal

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
down it smacks off the ground the normal

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
down it smacks off the ground the normal
force<00:00:52.140> pushing<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> board<00:00:53.879> from

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
force pushing back up on the board from

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
force pushing back up on the board from
the<00:00:54.360> ground<00:00:54.570> sends<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> air

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the ground sends it into the air

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
the ground sends it into the air
that's<00:00:56.370> called<00:00:56.699> pop<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.079> your

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that's called pop then you use your

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
that's called pop then you use your
front<00:00:58.829> foot<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> friction<00:00:59.969> between<00:01:00.149> your

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
front foot and friction between your

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
front foot and friction between your
front<00:01:00.629> foot<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> griptape<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.949> level<00:01:02.309> out

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
front foot and the griptape to level out

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
front foot and the griptape to level out
the<00:01:02.460> board<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> air<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.409> gravity

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the board up in the air and then gravity

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
the board up in the air and then gravity
wins<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> battle<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> brings<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
wins the battle and brings the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
wins the battle and brings the
skateboarder<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.799> board<00:01:08.010> together<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
skateboarder and the board together as a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.359 
skateboarder and the board together as a
system<00:01:09.000> back<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> ground<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
system back to the ground so now that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
system back to the ground so now that
you<00:01:11.520> understand<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:11.970> skateboarder<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.570> able

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you understand how skateboarder is able

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.270 
you understand how skateboarder is able
to<00:01:12.960> jump<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.740> ollie

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to jump with an ollie

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.530 
to jump with an ollie
you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> understand<00:01:15.000> how<00:01:15.180> they're<00:01:15.299> able<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you can understand how they're able to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
you can understand how they're able to
do<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> kickflip<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> kickflip<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> lot

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
do a kickflip so a kickflip is a lot

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
do a kickflip so a kickflip is a lot
like<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:17.939> ollie<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.049> back

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
like an ollie in that with your back

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.100 
like an ollie in that with your back
foot<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> same<00:01:20.759> torque<00:01:21.240> motion<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
foot you use the same torque motion to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.899 
foot you use the same torque motion to
create<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> pop<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.520> front<00:01:23.759> foot

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
create the pop but with your front foot

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
create the pop but with your front foot
instead<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> sliding<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.950> level<00:01:26.159> out

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
instead of sliding it up to level out

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.969 
instead of sliding it up to level out
the<00:01:26.430> board<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.119> slide<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.170> side<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the board you slide it off the side to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
the board you slide it off the side to
flip<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> board<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> case<00:01:30.600> you're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
flip the board so in this case you're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.770 
flip the board so in this case you're
applying<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.560> torque<00:01:31.890> rotating<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> board<00:01:33.060> 360

like this another trick that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.630 
like this another trick that
skateboarders<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.560> involves<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> 360

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640

is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.310> 360<00:01:44.909> shuvit<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.079> case

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
is the 360 shuvit so in this case

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
is the 360 shuvit so in this case
instead<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.009> rotating<00:01:47.490> around<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.939> axis

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
instead of rotating around this axis

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
instead of rotating around this axis
like<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> kickflip<00:01:49.200> you're<00:01:49.619> rotating<00:01:49.799> around

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like the kickflip you're rotating around

like the kickflip you're rotating around
this<00:01:50.759> axis<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> board<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.409> spinning
