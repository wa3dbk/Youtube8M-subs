different<00:01:41.460> areas<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.329> by<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:42.689> going

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
different areas we are by the way going

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
different areas we are by the way going
to<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.020> putting<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> vehicle<00:01:44.159> which

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to be putting it on a vehicle which

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.270 
to be putting it on a vehicle which
you'll<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.790> shortly<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.649> about<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
you'll see shortly out and about on the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580 
you'll see shortly out and about on the
roadways<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.750> night<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.350> again

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
roadways as well as at night so again

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.840 
roadways as well as at night so again
you<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> chance<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> from<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you get a chance to see it from a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.940 
you get a chance to see it from a
nighttime<00:01:51.149> application<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.960> well<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.770> will

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
nighttime application as well so we will

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
nighttime application as well so we will
be<00:01:53.040> doing<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> too<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.759> that'll<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.030> coming

be doing that too and that'll be coming

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.230 
be doing that too and that'll be coming
up<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:55.079> video<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:56.250> too<00:01:56.430> far<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.030> road

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
up in a video not too far down the road

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
up in a video not too far down the road
but<00:01:57.750> let's<00:01:57.930> take<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> close<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> light

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
but let's take a close look at the light

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
but let's take a close look at the light
and<00:01:59.520> get<00:01:59.729> some<00:01:59.939> tech<00:02:00.119> information<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and get some tech information on it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
and get some tech information on it
right<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.490> as<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> mentioned<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> moment<00:02:02.969> ago

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
right now as I mentioned a moment ago

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.450 
right now as I mentioned a moment ago
you<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> total<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> three<00:02:04.950> diodes<00:02:05.369> you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you it has the total of three diodes you

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.709 
you it has the total of three diodes you
can't<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:06.060> those<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
can't really see those in there in a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.529 
can't really see those in there in a
very<00:02:06.899> nice<00:02:07.110> deep<00:02:08.039> dish<00:02:08.310> reflector<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.360> kind

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
very nice deep dish reflector I'm kind

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.410 
very nice deep dish reflector I'm kind
of<00:02:09.569> moving<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
of moving around there

of moving around there
the<00:02:12.380> output<00:02:12.740> of<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.950> light<00:02:13.160> is<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.760> 1,100

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
the output of this light is at 1,100

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.080 
the output of this light is at 1,100
lumens<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:14.990> it's<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:15.740> darn<00:02:16.069> intense<00:02:16.640> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
lumens so it's pretty darn intense and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.780 
lumens so it's pretty darn intense and
it's<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.990> very<00:02:18.020> well-constructed<00:02:18.920> rugged

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
it's in a very well-constructed rugged

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's in a very well-constructed rugged
housing<00:02:20.630> which<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:20.900> also<00:02:21.170> nice<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:21.560> well<00:02:21.680> this

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
housing which is also nice as well this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.160 
housing which is also nice as well this
is<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:22.040> die<00:02:22.310> cast<00:02:22.670> aluminum<00:02:22.850> housing<00:02:23.540> which<00:02:24.020> by

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
is a die cast aluminum housing which by

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.930 
is a die cast aluminum housing which by
the<00:02:24.230> way<00:02:24.319> Weiland<00:02:24.800> makes<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.280> house<00:02:25.550> I've

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the way Weiland makes in house I've

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.309 
the way Weiland makes in house I've
actually<00:02:26.180> been<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.630> factory<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.110> seen

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
actually been to the factory and seen

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.400 
actually been to the factory and seen
this<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:28.340> also<00:02:28.520> comes<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.630> bail<00:02:30.050> bracket

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
this it also comes with a bail bracket

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.240 
this it also comes with a bail bracket
I've<00:02:30.500> attended<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.890> where<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.070> it's

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
I've attended this where I think it's

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.100 
I've attended this where I think it's
easy<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.580> camera<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.090> there's<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
easy for the camera to see there's the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.660 
easy for the camera to see there's the
bail<00:02:33.290> bracket<00:02:33.709> now<00:02:33.830> again<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.459> mount

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
bail bracket now again you can mount

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
bail bracket now again you can mount
this<00:02:34.850> in<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> variety<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.420> different<00:02:35.600> positions

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
this in a variety of different positions

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100 
this in a variety of different positions
by<00:02:37.070> using<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.580> bail<00:02:37.790> again<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:38.989> to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
by using the bail again you get to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.530 
by using the bail again you get to
decide<00:02:39.410> which<00:02:39.709> way<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.190> mount<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> we<00:02:41.390> will

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
decide which way to mount it and we will

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540 
decide which way to mount it and we will
be<00:02:41.630> putting<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> vehicle<00:02:42.770> as<00:02:42.890> well<00:02:43.040> in

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
be putting this on a vehicle as well in

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.070 
be putting this on a vehicle as well in
the<00:02:43.640> not<00:02:43.790> too<00:02:43.940> distant<00:02:43.970> future<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.690> showing

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
the not too distant future and showing

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.130 
the not too distant future and showing
it<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:46.190> nighttime<00:02:46.520> application<00:02:47.239> too<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
it in a nighttime application too so

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.050 
it in a nighttime application too so
that's<00:02:48.320> nice<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.650> know<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:49.550> from<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> lens

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's nice to know now from the lens

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.880 
that's nice to know now from the lens
perspective<00:02:50.600> which<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.810> mentioned<00:02:51.140> earlier<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
perspective which I mentioned earlier it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.390 
perspective which I mentioned earlier it
actually<00:02:52.310> has<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.930> standard<00:02:53.930> 8<00:02:54.650> degree<00:02:55.070> spot

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
actually has a standard 8 degree spot

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.100 
actually has a standard 8 degree spot
pattern<00:02:55.790> lens<00:02:56.000> which<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.269> currently<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.810> it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
pattern lens which is currently on it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.170 
pattern lens which is currently on it
right<00:02:57.350> now<00:02:57.380> now<00:02:58.250> should<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.519> decide<00:02:58.820> not<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
right now now should you decide not to

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.360 
right now now should you decide not to
use<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.750> spot<00:03:00.050> pattern<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.890> basically

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
use the spot pattern you can basically

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.640 
use the spot pattern you can basically
remove<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.850> by<00:03:01.970> taking<00:03:02.180> off<00:03:02.510> these<00:03:03.200> four

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
remove it by taking off these four

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.520 
remove it by taking off these four
screws<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.250> removing<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.360> front<00:03:05.780> cover<00:03:06.140> area

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
screws and removing the front cover area

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.520 
screws and removing the front cover area
that's<00:03:06.709> shown<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:08.150> taking<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.260> lens

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that's shown and then taking this lens

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.479 
that's shown and then taking this lens
cover<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.750> mounting<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.200> place<00:03:12.769> thereof

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
cover and mounting that in place thereof

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.710 
cover and mounting that in place thereof
and<00:03:13.670> obviously<00:03:13.910> I'm<00:03:14.000> doing<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.269> somewhat

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
and obviously I'm doing this somewhat

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.780 
and obviously I'm doing this somewhat
crudely<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.650> get<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.370> gist

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
crudely but you get the the gist

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.470 
crudely but you get the the gist
there<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.230> will<00:03:18.350> give<00:03:18.500> you<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> 40<00:03:19.160> by<00:03:19.310> 20

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
there and that will give you a 40 by 20

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.330 
there and that will give you a 40 by 20
flood<00:03:20.480> as<00:03:20.690> opposed<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.709> spot<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.220> yeah

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
flood as opposed to the spot so yeah

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.490 
flood as opposed to the spot so yeah
that's<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.610> nice<00:03:22.820> feature<00:03:23.239> with<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.140> light

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
that's a nice feature with this light

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.590 
that's a nice feature with this light
that<00:03:24.829> you've<00:03:25.280> got<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.610> ability<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.209> choose

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
that you've got the ability to choose

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.830 
that you've got the ability to choose
what<00:03:27.049> type<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.290> lens<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.310> want<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.610> have<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:29.570> it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
what type of lens you want to have on it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.270 
what type of lens you want to have on it
it's<00:03:30.680> also<00:03:30.980> rated<00:03:31.670> at<00:03:31.880> an<00:03:32.120> ip67<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.799> for<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.070> dust

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
it's also rated at an ip67 so for a dust

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's also rated at an ip67 so for a dust
and<00:03:34.549> water<00:03:34.760> resistance<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.390> again<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.810> going

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
and water resistance so again it's going

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.710 
and water resistance so again it's going
to<00:03:35.989> take<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> power<00:03:36.769> wash<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.519> rugged<00:03:38.209> driving

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
to take a power wash and rugged driving

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.080 
to take a power wash and rugged driving
not<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> problem<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:40.340> personally<00:03:40.820> think<00:03:40.940> you

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
not a problem and I personally think you

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.400 
not a problem and I personally think you
know<00:03:41.180> from<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.390> scene<00:03:41.570> light<00:03:41.720> point<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.019> view<00:03:42.170> on

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
know from a scene light point of view on

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.870 
know from a scene light point of view on
a<00:03:42.470> battalion<00:03:42.890> chief<00:03:43.040> vehicle<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.730> is

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
a battalion chief vehicle this is

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.009 
a battalion chief vehicle this is
definitely<00:03:44.150> something<00:03:44.540> which<00:03:44.630> might<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.840> of

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
definitely something which might be of

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.870 
definitely something which might be of
interest<00:03:45.170> but<00:03:45.829> also<00:03:45.890> from<00:03:46.340> an<00:03:46.459> off-road

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
interest but also from an off-road

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.759 
interest but also from an off-road
enthusiast<00:03:46.910> perspective<00:03:47.870> this<00:03:48.170> is<00:03:48.320> a<00:03:48.350> really

neat light there's no question about

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.810 
neat light there's no question about
that<00:03:50.860> from<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:51.980> voltage<00:03:52.310> you're<00:03:52.459> looking<00:03:52.670> at

that from the voltage you're looking at
12<00:03:53.120> volts<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:54.170> current<00:03:54.620> draw<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:55.040> around<00:03:55.670> 1

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
12 volts the current draw is around 1
