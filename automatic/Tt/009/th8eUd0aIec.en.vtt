for<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.630> even<00:00:36.870> half<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.440> second<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
for like not even half a second and you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
for like not even half a second and you
just<00:00:38.250> boost<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> certain<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.600> like

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
