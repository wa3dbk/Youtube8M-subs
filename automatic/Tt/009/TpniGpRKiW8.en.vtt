00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
overall it's going to be pretty good for

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.440 
overall it's going to be pretty good for
me<00:02:32.650> also<00:02:33.280> decide<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.879> engineer<00:02:34.269> class

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
me also decide to use the engineer class

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.420 
me also decide to use the engineer class
because<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.620> probably<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.250> most

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
because this is probably the most

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.640 
because this is probably the most
important<00:02:36.819> decision<00:02:37.030> first<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.989> all<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.379> knew

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
important decision first of all I knew

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.020 
important decision first of all I knew
that<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.980> tracer<00:02:39.340> dart<00:02:39.489> was<00:02:39.670> something<00:02:39.940> i

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that the tracer dart was something i

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.289 
that the tracer dart was something i
could<00:02:40.060> use<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:40.930> every<00:02:41.109> single<00:02:41.379> class<00:02:41.530> so

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
could use for every single class so

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.030 
could use for every single class so
Theresa<00:02:43.299> dart<00:02:43.510> was<00:02:43.629> important<00:02:44.079> so<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.409> decide

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
Theresa dart was important so I decide

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.699 
Theresa dart was important so I decide
to<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.280> know<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.269> you<00:02:47.049> know<00:02:47.140> vehicle<00:02:47.560> map

and<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.310> also<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.970> decided<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.540> use<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
and then also I decided to use the

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.059 
and then also I decided to use the
engineer<00:02:50.049> because<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:50.409> like<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.920> know<00:02:50.950> what

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
gives me points I know that capturing

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.420 
gives me points I know that capturing
flags<00:02:53.200> gives<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.620> points<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.069> do<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
flags gives you points so I can do that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.780 
flags gives you points so I can do that
every<00:02:54.760> single<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.870> know<00:02:55.900> class<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.920> I'm<00:02:57.609> like

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
every single you know class and I'm like

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.890 
every single you know class and I'm like
you<00:02:57.970> know<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.090> should<00:02:58.359> go<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.629> medic

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
you know I should go with the medic

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.660 
you know I should go with the medic
because<00:02:59.109> I<00:02:59.200> can<00:02:59.349> heal<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.859> then<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.129> can<00:03:00.310> revive

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the problem with that is that every

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.780 
the problem with that is that every

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.650 
punkbuster all of that stuff GGC and the
only<00:04:43.340> problem<00:04:43.639> is<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.910> kick<00:04:44.120> people<00:04:44.480> for

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
only problem is that the kick people for

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.900 
only problem is that the kick people for
hyping<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.350> you'll<00:04:46.070> see<00:04:46.310> in<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.730> game

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
hyping so you'll see in this game

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.330 
hyping so you'll see in this game
playing<00:04:47.120> people<00:04:47.510> randomly<00:04:47.870> get<00:04:48.050> kicked<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:48.470> it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
playing people randomly get kicked so it

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.800 
playing people randomly get kicked so it
was<00:04:49.460> still<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.700> full<00:04:49.940> server<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.270> think<00:04:50.510> each

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
was still a full server I think each

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.690 
was still a full server I think each
side<00:04:51.169> had<00:04:51.380> 15<00:04:51.770> people<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.370> would<00:04:52.460> be<00:04:52.580> like

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
side had 15 people so it would be like

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.240 
side had 15 people so it would be like
