guy and you're gonna rotate them and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.270 
guy and you're gonna rotate them and
this<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> supposed<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.660> his<00:01:00.840> lips<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.829> once

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this is supposed to be his lips so once

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
this is supposed to be his lips so once
you<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.879> position<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.960> doesn't

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you get a little position it doesn't

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.240 
you get a little position it doesn't
have<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.379> perfect<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.159> gonna

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
have to be perfect because you're gonna

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
have to be perfect because you're gonna
play<00:01:05.549> around<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> lot<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
play around with this a lot I think this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
play around with this a lot I think this
is<00:01:06.720> probably<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> tougher<00:01:07.950> parts<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is probably one of the tougher parts of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
is probably one of the tougher parts of
making<00:01:08.640> Joker<00:01:09.110> just<00:01:10.110> duplicate<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> change<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
making Joker just duplicate it change it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.440 
making Joker just duplicate it change it
to<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.280> color<00:01:11.490> white<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to the color white and then have it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.080 
to the color white and then have it
overlap<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.470> red<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.220> basically<00:01:14.970> you're<00:01:15.060> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
overlap the red so basically you're just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
overlap the red so basically you're just
trying<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> make<00:01:15.479> his<00:01:15.689> lips<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.650> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
trying to make his lips and you want to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.960 
trying to make his lips and you want to
be<00:01:16.890> kind<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> messy<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
be kind of messy because you know

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.690 
be kind of messy because you know
Joker's<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.689> puts<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.560> crazy<00:01:19.890> lipstick<00:01:20.520> or

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Joker's just puts on crazy lipstick or

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
Joker's just puts on crazy lipstick or
whatever<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.689> once<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.710> you're

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
whatever so once you do that you're

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
whatever so once you do that you're
gonna<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.640> find<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> splat<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.080> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
gonna go find the splat now this is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
gonna go find the splat now this is
where<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> eyes<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.189> Joker<00:01:26.610> you're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
where you make the eyes of Joker you're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
where you make the eyes of Joker you're
going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.479> end<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.810> using<00:01:27.990> three<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
going to actually end up using three of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
going to actually end up using three of
these<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.939> eyes

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
these two of these will be for the eyes

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.810 
these two of these will be for the eyes
and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> third<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.110> will<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.579> top

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and then the third one will be the top

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
and then the third one will be the top

and right i want the left one to be
slightly<00:01:43.590> cut<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> third

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
slightly cut off and now with the third

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
slightly cut off and now with the third
one<00:01:45.420> you're<00:01:45.659> gonna<00:01:45.750> make<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.170> white<00:01:46.439> you're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
one you're gonna make this white you're

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
going to put it right in the middle so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660 
going to put it right in the middle so
this<00:01:48.750> gives<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:49.110> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.770> evil<00:01:50.220> eye<00:01:50.340> look

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
this gives them kind of an evil eye look

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270 
this gives them kind of an evil eye look
rather<00:01:50.970> than<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.450> circular<00:01:51.990> type<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> eye<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
rather than a circular type of eye and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
rather than a circular type of eye and
just<00:01:53.970> play<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.720> position<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just play around with that position in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.350 
just play around with that position in
right<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.829> middle<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> you'll<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.000> those

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
right in the middle and you'll get those

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.520 
right in the middle and you'll get those
slanted<00:01:57.780> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> eyes

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
slanted kind of eyes

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.710 
slanted kind of eyes

the right and once you get a good angle

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.960 
the right and once you get a good angle
on<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.819> is
