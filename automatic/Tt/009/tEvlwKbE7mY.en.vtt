00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 why some children are good students 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.210
 and others not as they are 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.219
 first day before her new fifth 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 class she told her students 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.340
 the untruth 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 Like most teachers, she also looked 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.390
 their students and explained to them that they 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 she would like to have everyone in her 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
 But that was not true because 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 in the first row sat in itself 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 slumped a little boy 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.210
 called teddy store and she liked that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.219
 not at all he was miss 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 thomson scho noticed in the year before 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.730
 and she had noticed that he rarely came along 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 his other children played his part 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.290
 clothes was grubby and he usually like that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.730
 unappetizing also that one on the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 Dearest immediately in the bathtub 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.789
 it would have added that teddy 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 sometimes it could get very uncomfortable 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.300
 it came to so far that miss thomson 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 actually it began to enjoy its 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 work with a thick red 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.410
 correct pen and end 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 to write a big five under it 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.590
 the school at the miss thomson 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 It was a duty to teach that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.100
 Teacher reviews of colleagues 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.590
 from the earlier years about the students 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 Read and report on teddy the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.460
 she had pushed all the way back 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.780
 but she finally did 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.590
 they forced a surprise 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.229
 tennis teacher in the first grade 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.509
 wrote the following teddy is one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.070
 smart child it laughs a lot he does his 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.939
 Homework very neat and has 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.939
 good manners a pleasant student the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.409
 colleagues from the second class noted 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 Teddy is a very good student and at 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 popular with his classmates 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.090
 However, he also has a few 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.549
 Difficulties because his mother is under 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 an incurable disease suffers and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 life at home seems to be difficult 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.060
 is the teacher in the third grade 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.340
 wrote the death of his mother has teddy 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 obviously very upset he makes an effort 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.799
 but his father does not seem to care much 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 to take care of him 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.710
 and if not certain steps soon 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.649
 it will be undertaken 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.090
 probably follow 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 from the fourth class fight following 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.590
 assessment teddy is withdrawn and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.869
 shows no interest in the school 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.350
 he has hardly any friends and sometimes sleeps 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.700
 In class, this thompson began 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.739
 to see each other a bit 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.599
 and she feels even worse than 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.519
 the children before you on the last day of school 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.750
 small gifts for the christmas holidays 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.310
 All presented handsomely 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 were wrapped up and with 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.599
 decorated festive grind 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.739
 except for teddy that was one 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.410
 dingy brown kraft paper 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.239
 Wrapped and miss thomson felt 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.190
 unwell his packet in front of everyone else 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.870
 unpack 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.030
 the other kids started to laugh 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.340
 as a small rhinestone bracelet for 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.349
 A series of stones came to light 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.620
 were missing and a half empty bottle 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.180
 dad but the laughter of the children he died 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.400
 as miss thomson the bracelet 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.400
 turned down and a little bit of the par full 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 on the wrist dripping beautifully 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.110
 Thank you She said the city is waiting for him 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.540
 this day until all other children 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.040
 gone and said it is gone 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.180
 Thompson they have the same today 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.069
 smelled like my mother used to 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.079
 after it had gone also work caught the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.840
 Dancing and crying could do almost one 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.670
 not stop for an hour 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.709
 This was the last day you read 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.810
 write and calculate taught by 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.329
 that day she started instead 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.030
 to teach children and especially 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.889
 teddy got more attention from then on and 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.569
 Genese cares about him the more 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.910
 to become alive 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.040
 the more she encouraged him the better 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.720
 he was in his achievements towards the end 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.660
 of the school year, he was one of the best 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.310
 students of the class and in contrast to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.739
 their lie in the beginning that they all 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.370
 teddy liked children very much 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.019
 one of her favorite students 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.579
 a year later she found a small one 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.950
 note from teddy under the door 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.600
 miss thomson you are still the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.319
 best teacher I ever had 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.209
 Instead of six years passed before 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.670
 The next little letter from Teddy 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.530
 got in that he told that he now 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.989
 to have graduated from high school as 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.880
 third best of his class and that she 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.549
 still the best teacher of all 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.370
 was after four more years came the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.169
 next letter though sometimes very 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.760
 he would have been difficult 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.220
 maintained and would be close now 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.750
 his uni exam if i went wrong 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.970
 would run with top marks 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.470
 He also wanted to tell her that 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.340
 she still has the best teaching 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.049
 was he ever had and 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.270
 another four years later arrived 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.370
 Another letter from Teddy this time 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.380
 He told her that he would be after him 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.420
 state examination would have done one more 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.070
 had studied a bit further and that 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.080
 thompson is still the best 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.900
 teacher of all times was for him and 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.140
 this letter was signed with dr 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.220
 theodor f instead 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.380
 but this story is not over yet 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.130
 end because there still came a letter in 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.080
 this year 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.850
 Teddy wrote that he is a young woman 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.040
 got to know and marry her 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.360
 wanted to be under his father before some 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.400
 Time always wanted to die 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.740
 ask if miss thomson maybe 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.550
 even wedding ceremony in the square 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.350
 would sit 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.680
 usually for the mother of the 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.200
 must be reserved groom said 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.700
 of course, and not only that she wore 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.430
 also the bracelet with the many the 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.930
 Stones and the PV that at that time 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.840
 the last Christmas party with his 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.880
 mother had remembered she hugged herself 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.630
 and doctors.at whispered miss thomson 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.790
 into the ear 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.350
 thanks to the system and that at that time 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.060
 i have believed i am really 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.590
 thankful that they gave me that back then 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.610
 I felt that I was important 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.410
 am and can actually achieve something 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.930
 it was dancing had tears in his eyes 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.970
 When she answered Teddy it was exactly 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.020
 vice versa you showed me what 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.850
 was really important 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.060
 I did not know what to teach 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.430
 before i met you teddys 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.979
 start today is the doctor on the bed 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.630
 hospital in the one and works in the 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.950
 kita planning which is named after him 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.810
 this story is already circulating 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.310
 long in the english speaking internet and 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.590
 although she is not really true 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.450
 but to the so-called urban legends 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.430
 I have heard one thing 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.260
 sunday morning times in the living room before 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.090
 our wood stove with a cup of tea 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.810
 sat down and this story for you 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.240
 translated 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.830
 because true or not true not everyone 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.600
 is as lucky as teddy and ours 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.640
 task here is learning it is 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.979
 yes, to help those who learn better 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.050
 and lead a self-determined life 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.610
 their story is not so cheap 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.610
 but that is still the case 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.140
 want to move forward in their life about 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.520
 if you like this story then 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.840
 they just do not make sense with others 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.099
 which they believe is theirs 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.210
