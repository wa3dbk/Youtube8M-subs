ething very very nice indeed and now

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
ething very very nice indeed and now
although<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.520> played<00:01:38.790> him<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.150> forward

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
although I played him at right forward

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.640 
although I played him at right forward
and<00:01:39.600> he's<00:01:39.690> got<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> left<00:01:40.170> foot<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.440> means

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and he's got a left foot which means

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
and he's got a left foot which means
he's<00:01:40.770> perfect<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.220> cutting<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.729> he<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
he's perfect for cutting in he is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.820 
he's perfect for cutting in he is
actually<00:01:42.450> better<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.960> distributing<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> ball

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
actually better at distributing the ball

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.370 
actually better at distributing the ball
so<00:01:44.070> he<00:01:44.400> managed<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> get<00:01:44.790> me<00:01:44.909> 11<00:01:45.299> goals<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.750> 27

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
so he managed to get me 11 goals in 27

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
so he managed to get me 11 goals in 27
games<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:47.280> assisted<00:01:47.700> far<00:01:47.970> far<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.299> he

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
games but he assisted far far more he

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.510 
games but he assisted far far more he
probably<00:01:48.659> assisted<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.409> 20<00:01:49.860> goals<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.400> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
probably assisted about 20 goals in that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.380 
probably assisted about 20 goals in that
time<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.850> well<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.150> absolutely

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
time as well which is absolutely

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.000 
time as well which is absolutely
fantastic<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:52.830> as

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
fantastic I'm really good to have as

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.880 
fantastic I'm really good to have as
much<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.930> emphasis<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.080> attack<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.530> possible

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
much like emphasis on attack as possible

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.859 
much like emphasis on attack as possible
even<00:01:56.010> if<00:01:56.280> he<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:57.000> assisting<00:01:57.540> every

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
even if he is just assisting every

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
even if he is just assisting every
single<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:58.290> that's<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.650> very<00:01:59.010> useful<00:01:59.159> he

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
single one so that's very very useful he

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.039 
single one so that's very very useful he
also<00:01:59.850> has<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> believe<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.510> like<00:02:00.600> 92

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
also has I believe it's like 92

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
also has I believe it's like 92
reactions<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:01.920> usually<00:02:02.070> include<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
reactions I don't usually include the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.520 
reactions I don't usually include the
mental<00:02:03.180> skills<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.080> didn't<00:02:04.350> include

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
mental skills in so I didn't include

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.749 
mental skills in so I didn't include
that<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.400> helps

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that one but that really helps

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.460 
that one but that really helps
forgetting<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.210> rebounds<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.259> seems

forgetting the rebounds from what seems

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.289
