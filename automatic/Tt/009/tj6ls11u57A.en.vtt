00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
so for it its maximum lumens are 50

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.430 
so for it its maximum lumens are 50
there<00:00:19.369> you<00:00:19.460> go<00:00:19.610> really<00:00:20.540> bright<00:00:20.750> I<00:00:20.779> know<00:00:20.990> sorry

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
to you guys then we've got the maximum

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.060 
to you guys then we've got the maximum
distance<00:00:25.880> for<00:00:26.360> the<00:00:26.450> beams<00:00:26.779> is<00:00:26.960> 35<00:00:27.470> meters

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
distance for the beams is 35 meters

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.619 
distance for the beams is 35 meters
brightness<00:00:31.070> levels<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:31.730> have<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.360> course

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
brightness levels we have the of course

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.040 
brightness levels we have the of course
the<00:00:32.900> all<00:00:33.230> on<00:00:33.530> bright<00:00:34.360> turns<00:00:35.360> off<00:00:35.540> after<00:00:35.600> one

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
the all on bright turns off after one

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.290 
the all on bright turns off after one
click<00:00:36.739> it<00:00:36.860> twice<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.730> know<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:37.970> looks<00:00:38.090> like

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
click it twice and I know it looks like

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.939 
click it twice and I know it looks like
it's<00:00:38.449> strobing<00:00:38.900> kind<00:00:39.199> of<00:00:39.260> for<00:00:39.440> some<00:00:39.620> reason

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
it's strobing kind of for some reason

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.619 
it's strobing kind of for some reason
sorry<00:00:40.820> about<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:40.970> but<00:00:41.239> it's<00:00:41.360> just<00:00:41.480> like<00:00:41.600> a

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
sorry about that but it's just like a

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.299 
sorry about that but it's just like a
lower<00:00:41.870> light<00:00:42.170> level<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.949> maximum<00:00:43.129> off

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
lower light level and the maximum off

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.670 
lower light level and the maximum off
after<00:00:46.309> 38<00:00:46.610> strobes<00:00:46.989> so<00:00:47.989> there<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.170> go<00:00:48.350> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
after 38 strobes so there you go and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.610 
after 38 strobes so there you go and
then<00:00:49.430> if<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.760> hold<00:00:50.030> down<00:00:50.149> on<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:50.750> I'll<00:00:51.410> switch

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
then if you hold down on it I'll switch

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.750 
then if you hold down on it I'll switch
to<00:00:51.800> red<00:00:52.780> and<00:00:53.780> again<00:00:54.079> I'll<00:00:54.200> turn<00:00:54.379> off<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:55.430> twice

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
to red and again I'll turn off it twice

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.420 
to red and again I'll turn off it twice
and<00:00:56.090> then<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.300> have<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.450> red<00:00:56.600> stroke<00:00:57.309> hold<00:00:58.309> it

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
and then you have a red stroke hold it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.430 
and then you have a red stroke hold it
again<00:00:58.640> goes<00:00:59.570> back<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.610> there's<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.480> different

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
again goes back so there's the different

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.859 
again goes back so there's the different
settings<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.640> average<00:01:04.850> run<00:01:05.360> time<00:01:05.600> on

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
settings on it the average run time on

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.710 
settings on it the average run time on
the<00:01:05.990> high<00:01:06.170> brightness<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.979> 55<00:01:07.789> hours<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.630> on

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
the high brightness is 55 hours and on

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.029 
the high brightness is 55 hours and on
low<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.140> 140<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.850> that's<00:01:11.000> a<00:01:11.090> lot<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.840> time<00:01:12.050> for<00:01:12.979> a

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
low is 140 so that's a lot of time for a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.930 
low is 140 so that's a lot of time for a
headlamp<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:15.009> think<00:01:16.009> it's<00:01:16.160> just<00:01:16.250> incredible

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
headlamp I think it's just incredible

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.080 
headlamp I think it's just incredible
for<00:01:17.240> being<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.570> long<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.020> mean<00:01:18.110> that's<00:01:18.229> crazy

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
for being that long I mean that's crazy

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.950 
for being that long I mean that's crazy
I've<00:01:20.090> never<00:01:20.240> really<00:01:20.479> owned<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.720> head<00:01:20.840> night

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
I've never really owned a head night

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.780 
I've never really owned a head night
before<00:01:21.229> this<00:01:21.290> is<00:01:21.380> my<00:01:21.470> first<00:01:21.680> headlamp<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.189> I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
before this is my first headlamp and I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.190 
before this is my first headlamp and I
just<00:01:23.210> picked<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.510> one<00:01:23.689> because<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.930> how<00:01:23.990> long

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
just picked this one because of how long

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.109 
just picked this one because of how long
it<00:01:24.260> lasts<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:25.040> don't<00:01:25.610> really<00:01:25.790> need<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.030> be

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it lasts so I don't really need to be

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.250 
it lasts so I don't really need to be
too<00:01:26.299> concerned<00:01:26.630> about<00:01:26.750> carrying<00:01:27.140> around

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
too concerned about carrying around

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.800 
too concerned about carrying around
batteries<00:01:27.680> all<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.950> time<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.420> still<00:01:29.630> will

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
batteries all the time but I still will

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.560 
batteries all the time but I still will
probably<00:01:30.610> takes<00:01:31.610> three<00:01:31.850> triple<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.210> batteries

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
probably takes three triple a batteries

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.820 
probably takes three triple a batteries
just<00:01:33.009> in<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.070> top<00:01:34.280> here<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:34.909> kind<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.119> them

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
just in the top here so you kind of them

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.950 
just in the top here so you kind of them
just<00:01:36.830> kind<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.369> flips<00:01:37.759> open<00:01:37.960> batteries

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
just kind of flips open batteries

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440 
just kind of flips open batteries
go<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.259> there<00:01:39.409> kind<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.430> flips<00:01:40.970> back<00:01:41.180> together

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
go in there kind of flips back together

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.140 
go in there kind of flips back together
so<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:41.780> kind<00:01:41.900> of<00:01:41.990> pull<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:43.150> pops

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
so you just kind of pull on that pops

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.350 
so you just kind of pull on that pops
open<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:46.280> weighs<00:01:46.430> two<00:01:46.670> point<00:01:46.909> nine<00:01:46.970> ounces

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
open and it weighs two point nine ounces

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.440 
open and it weighs two point nine ounces
so<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.869> not<00:01:48.049> exactly<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:49.729> know<00:01:49.820> light<00:01:50.299> or

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so it's not exactly you know light or

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.850 
so it's not exactly you know light or
anything<00:01:50.780> like<00:01:50.810> super<00:01:51.290> light<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
anything like super light but it is

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.800 
anything like super light but it is
fairly<00:01:52.130> light<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:52.700> headlamp<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.240> size<00:01:53.450> you

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
fairly light for headlamp this size you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.539 
fairly light for headlamp this size you
know<00:01:53.930> ray<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.070> bit<00:01:55.250> more<00:01:55.369> than

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
know ray is just a little bit more than

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.330 
know ray is just a little bit more than
my<00:01:55.670> knife<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.240> that's<00:01:56.420> kind<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.659> cool<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.340> buy

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
my knife so that's kind of cool to buy

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.160 
my knife so that's kind of cool to buy
like<00:01:58.549> keeping<00:01:58.939> things<00:01:59.090> fairly<00:01:59.479> light<00:01:59.780> because

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
like keeping things fairly light because

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.990 
like keeping things fairly light because
I<00:02:00.290> throw<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.009> lot<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.340> weight<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.579> place<00:02:01.759> I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
I throw in a lot of weight in place I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.280
