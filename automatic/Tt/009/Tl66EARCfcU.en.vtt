scion fr-s drifting I just got this car

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.640 
scion fr-s drifting I just got this car
from<00:00:16.650> turn<00:00:17.130> 10<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.730> sent<00:00:18.000> me<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.539> design<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
from turn 10 they sent me the design the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.200 
from turn 10 they sent me the design the
cars<00:00:19.859> been<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> while<00:00:20.460> I've<00:00:20.730> had

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
cars been there for a while I've had

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.849 
cars been there for a while I've had
access<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.380> I'm<00:00:22.470> talking<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
access to that but I'm talking with the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.650 
access to that but I'm talking with the
design<00:00:23.130> itself<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.789> don't<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.240> everyone

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
design itself I don't know if everyone

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
design itself I don't know if everyone
got<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.109> or<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.470> specific<00:00:25.859> people<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
got it or just specific people but it's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580 
got it or just specific people but it's
still<00:00:27.210> pretty<00:00:27.269> cool<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.199> thought<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.439> should

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
still pretty cool and I thought I should

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
still pretty cool and I thought I should
do<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> drift<00:00:29.099> tuned<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> guys<00:00:30.019> just

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
do a drift tuned for you guys just

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.950 
do a drift tuned for you guys just
because<00:00:31.230> I've<00:00:31.380> never<00:00:31.410> done<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:32.700> scion<00:00:33.510> drifting

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
because I've never done a scion drifting

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
because I've never done a scion drifting
before<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.950> thought<00:00:35.100> it'd<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.250> interesting

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
before and I thought it'd be interesting

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.790 
before and I thought it'd be interesting
and<00:00:35.880> they're<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:36.930> good<00:00:37.410> drift

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and they're actually really good drift

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.610 
and they're actually really good drift
cars<00:00:38.040> I've<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.059> never<00:00:39.510> driven<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.200> scion

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
cars I've actually never driven a scion

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.150 
cars I've actually never driven a scion
in<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> game<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.239> Forza<00:00:42.600> 4<00:00:42.980> which<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
in this game like in Forza 4 which is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
in this game like in Forza 4 which is
crazy<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:46.170> never<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
crazy but I'm not I was never really a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.130 
crazy but I'm not I was never really a
big<00:00:46.800> fan<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.039> those<00:00:47.309> cars<00:00:47.719> I'm<00:00:48.719> starting<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
big fan of those cars I'm starting to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.439 
big fan of those cars I'm starting to
like<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> longest<00:00:51.120> time<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
like them now but for the longest time I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.479 
like them now but for the longest time I
never<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.020> liked<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
never really liked them and I think the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.779 
never really liked them and I think the
first<00:00:53.699> time<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.059> saw<00:00:54.390> him<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
first time I saw him one was back in the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.330 
first time I saw him one was back in the
Fast<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.300> Furious<00:00:57.360> game<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.770> when

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
Fast and the Furious game that was when

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549 
Fast and the Furious game that was when
Tokyo<00:00:59.789> Drift<00:01:00.000> came<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.260> first

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
Tokyo Drift came out that was the first

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.070 
Tokyo Drift came out that was the first
time<00:01:01.800> ever<00:01:02.010> saw<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.840> 10

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
time ever saw and I was about I think 10

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
time ever saw and I was about I think 10
years<00:01:04.320> old<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.670> wasn't<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.150> interested

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
years old and I wasn't really interested

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
years old and I wasn't really interested
in<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.930> car<00:01:07.430> but<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.729> starting<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
in that car but I'm starting to have a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.530 
in that car but I'm starting to have a
liking<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.570> them<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.080> bad<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.540> yes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
liking for them they're not bad and yes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480 
liking for them they're not bad and yes
this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:14.070> good<00:01:14.250> drift

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this is it it's a pretty good drift

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.859 
this is it it's a pretty good drift
drift<00:01:15.270> car<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> drifts<00:01:16.049> pretty<00:01:16.830> good

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
drift car like it drifts pretty good

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
drift car like it drifts pretty good
overall<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.380> great<00:01:19.830> car<00:01:20.100> i'm<00:01:20.280> running<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.640> think

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
overall a great car i'm running I think

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.410 
overall a great car i'm running I think
604<00:01:21.570> horsepower<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.850> 2,400<00:01:23.850> pounds<00:01:24.210> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
604 horsepower with 2,400 pounds that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.310 
604 horsepower with 2,400 pounds that's
pretty<00:01:24.689> balanced<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.869> I've<00:01:27.869> actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
pretty balanced out and I've actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
pretty balanced out and I've actually
been<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.280> used<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> guys

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
been not I used to go on to you guys

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
been not I used to go on to you guys
saying<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.799> over<00:01:32.250> 600<00:01:32.520> horsepower<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
saying how well over 600 horsepower is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
saying how well over 600 horsepower is
in<00:01:34.170> good<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> crap<00:01:34.650> i<00:01:35.210> think<00:01:36.210> i<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
in good and crap i think i have a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
in good and crap i think i have a
different<00:01:36.720> outlook<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.189> i've

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
different outlook on that now that i've

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.069 
different outlook on that now that i've
been<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.759> drifting<00:01:39.210> over<00:01:39.720> six<00:01:40.020> hours

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
been actually drifting over six hours

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
been actually drifting over six hours
power<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.430> problem<00:01:41.790> with

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
power I don't really have a problem with

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.590 
power I don't really have a problem with
it<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.479> thought<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:44.189> uh<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.390> tune

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it I thought I would but uh if you tune

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.510 
it I thought I would but uh if you tune
it<00:01:45.780> right<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.490> matters

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it right I don't really think it matters

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
it right I don't really think it matters
as<00:01:47.970> much<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> gearing<00:01:49.439> set<00:01:49.770> up

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
as much because I got the gearing set up

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.160 
as much because I got the gearing set up
so<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.729> end<00:01:50.880> speed<00:01:51.030> tops<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> i<00:01:52.110> think

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so the top end speed tops of it i think

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.100 
so the top end speed tops of it i think
i<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.070> car<00:01:53.280> tops<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.700> 160<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.990> it's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
i think this car tops are 160 but it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110 
i think this car tops are 160 but it's
running<00:01:55.439> over

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
running over

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.110 
running over
600<00:01:56.510> horsepower<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.190> still<00:01:58.550> has<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.880> power

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
600 horsepower so it still has the power

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.000 
600 horsepower so it still has the power
in<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> car<00:01:59.660> but<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.080> doesn't<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> top<00:02:00.740> end

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.270 
in the car but it doesn't have a top end
speed<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.400> will<00:02:01.550> screw<00:02:02.300> up<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:03.140> gears<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:04.250> I

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
speed that will screw up the gears so I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.920 
speed that will screw up the gears so I
can<00:02:04.520> still<00:02:04.760> get<00:02:04.940> some<00:02:05.090> good<00:02:05.270> trick<00:02:05.780> thing

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
can still get some good trick thing

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.670
