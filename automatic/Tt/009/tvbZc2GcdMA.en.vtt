 that really catches it and makes the ball 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.320
 of math is so I can think of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.739
 good unit to see for a new 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.739
 function 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.630

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.040
 I will find he is a producer 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.370

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.830
 in the handling of the ball we go for this 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.830
 function 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 and we do 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.790
 Hello

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 estudio daniel is a music producer 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.310
 good daniel and tell us what projects 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.530
 they have right now in mind a little bit of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.240
 everything I'm a music producer so they're 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.420
 coming different projects always 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.630
 every football class if the game but 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.700
 bliss or player not only play fans 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.909
 of the selection and your position we like 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.430
 two in the cascarita I'm eight years old 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.000
 dedicated 100% to juggling like 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.290
 value knew the glass 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.380
 so what do you think if you show us 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.380
 here 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.939
 good 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.959
 what good then so you brought me 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.159
 here there is no fusion merger right 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.959
 of music and football then nothing to me is 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.849
 it happens to me that we can give and see a little 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.670
 the sounds and rhythms that are creating 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.440
 liked and find the connection 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.830
 musical and then we can start to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.170
 record something and go 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.750
 the movement made by a body 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.730
 generates waves similar to those that have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.070
 the sound if to that movement what 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.930
 we capture and digitize what we can 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.420
 turn into wave patterns for 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.550
 build a musical track or let's go 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.550
 to make music using movements 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.879
 ah 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.310
 the world 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.310
 ah 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.500
 for me 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.550
 ah 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.329
 red as they were was super chÃ©veres de 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.530
 an idea totally different from what I 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.060
 have done 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.900
 I've always had fun picking up sounds 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.329
 different elements in this case with the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.889
 skin sound the clothes moving the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.840
 ball 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.289
 I am very interesting commercial and play a 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.720
 little between sport and music 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.620
 which is good fun 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.620
 and it is already 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.550
 and these people 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.740

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.069
