00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.740
 hello guys I bring you a new video and 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.630
 well I bring you the following here what 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.639
 you are seeing, you have asked me many 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.559
 to do a mini tnt tutorial that 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.750
 they explode and well I answered you 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.119
 I said I would do it during this week or 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 the next one so good is the one I'm going 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.749
 to do the tutorial is worth 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 well let's start with what would be 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.070
 the basic command let's see here that 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 we have that no agreement is worth this not 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 has nothing to do is very simple but 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 first of all I wanted to comment on some 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 cosillas is worth now I will explain everything 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 this you will see that it is very easy 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 It is not very easy but good 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 I'll explain, okay, before anything, I wanted to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.649
 tell you that the series on how to improve your 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.379
 house for all those who are me 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.390
 saying that I've done it already and this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.159
 I'm going to leave it for Christmas, it's worth it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 it costs me a lot to record this series 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.690
 takes a long time to rise and the truth is that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
 well I prefer to leave it for Christmas 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.040
 I have more time now I am exams 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 and I'm not, I can not, so the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.150
 I'll leave for Christmas and you'll see when 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.990
 upload the penultimate episode and I will warn you 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.009
 and everything and well let's go there we continue 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.990
 yesterday that I have already uploaded a video but 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.509
 I could not but well I did not have time let's go 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 to the command to get the house the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.729
 little box is that it would be a head worth 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.259
 we do so is a head is the version 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.259
 it is not true that he lowered the volume 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.590
 OK 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.590
 we see that it is readable 397 that 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.280
 it would be the idea of ​​the head 13 that would be 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.520
 the 397 3 and the amount that is 1 school 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.310
 auner good the head of this character 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.310
 ok if we take now and do well 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.650
 wait for me to throw this thing that does not work anymore 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.960
 ok gives us the head of the tnt 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.250
 well, that's how we got it 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.870
 I will leave all the commands in the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.660
 description and let's now with what 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.940
 they would be the chungo here we have a clock 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.000
 I wanted it to be a fast clock so 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.890
 this does not work but it's not worth it 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.040
 it was a fast clock so I've done 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 This is very simple, you see if you want it 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.110
 copy I leave it 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 we go with the good command I think 6 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.420
 in a very very attentive thing worth watching 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.850
 on the scoreboard if he is here in the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.730
 0 is I worth when I put the flip you have 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.640
 seen that a 1 comes out and returns to 0 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.250
 so this is the next 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 it is a command I had never used it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.510
 I 've generated it, I've seen it from a 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120
 video I said good so I'm going to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.099
 explain in Spanish to them it would be worth 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.730
 a score board player set that we already know 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.810
 that this is to place 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.739
 a number of points to a player in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.989
 a goal is worth it but with one you have to 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.280
 have a good this here has to 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.890
 have a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.990
 Well, good as it is now 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.020
 there has to be something for this to happen 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.880
 ok if it's not going to work and it would be the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.670
 next conditional it's worth has to 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.520
 have a condition for him to put the is 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.440
 the end is 0 ok there must be this 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.620
 condition the following condition that in 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.310
 the coordinates minus 590 and 56 733 and with 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.670
 a radius of 4 the flint score go to 1 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.590
 this means that if in a 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.800
 radio of 4 in those coordinates we 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.350
 we use the flynt it will go up to 1 like there 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.670
 You see you have seen it has gone up to 1 and 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.660
 will execute the next when carlos 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.280
 I will explain 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.340
 but now you will say and because if I'm not 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.950
 in those coordinates good low 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.450
 equally to zero it's because I do not 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.610
 I was interested in adding this up 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.989
 because if it would not have to be good, you have to 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.150
 do it this way because if we do not 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.030
 it will work I have put the following here 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.610
 it's core board player set it detects when 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.890
 the end be of one and in the whole world 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.750
 this was going to place the flynt at zero or 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.330
 is it going to return it to zero or is it worth 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.040
 you see like this and return it to zero 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.890
 I do not know if you have understood this 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.870
 command to see this is a condition the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.550
 command will be executed only if this 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.770
 condition that means that in these 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.580
 coordinates in a radius of 4 if used 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.400
 The lighter 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.760
 will not reset and this will signal to 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.980
 this command like the score board is worth 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.950
 it is very simple the score wars 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.540
 I have 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.880
 here it's worth not here 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.970
 the score bars is very simple, it adds a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.770
 point every time you use the lighter 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.020
 then well bathed a point and as I have 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.020
 put this here it's worth then let's go to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.850
 the next thing is to teach the effect it gives 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.220
 there will not be sounds because I'm in the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.020
 pirate minecraft even good this what 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.410
 will do is his manna clipper in the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.060
 coordinates there the one that is taught with 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.040
 issue one this means that the 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.380
 criteria will be on when it 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.450
 exposes vouchers and it's as if we 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.860
 let's go with the lighter without giving it 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.050
 it will be on, ready to explode 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.040
 I'm going to put a fuse of zero that the rifle 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.690
 means the time it will take 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.280
 to exploit the more you put more 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.630
 it will take me I have put zero so that 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.160
 appear and I exploded goes after we go to 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.160
 do the test here 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.290
 we come here and we do well we see that 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.970
 exploits do so again I have been 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.460
 gone wrong now we have to explode 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.130
 good this the little box goes a little 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.860
 bad because it's not very good we see 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.900
 that exploits good now what exploited 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.240
 ok you saw the clipper there you see 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.290
 a little bit but well this is already worth going to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.290
 make a game room 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:35.199
 ok let's do like this you'll see like this and 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.319
 now yes that tight because he had 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.209
 got the game room but this is very 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.889
 shabby because you see that in the head 

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:44.439
 it has to be pressured I come here 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.509
 already or so it's going to explode equally 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.309
 the head is only for maps of 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.039
 adventures you already know that this is not that 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:54.339
 is a tnt that is generated so it is 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.449
 everything with command blocks and good 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.069
 guys I'll leave the commands in the 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.529
 description if you have any problem or 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.539
 something you say some suggestion of 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.159
 videos also the saying I hope that 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.289
 you have understood the commands well I do not know 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.599
 if it will have cost you is that they seem to me 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.189
 quite rare to open the truth I do not know if 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.050
 you have understood them well but good 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.819
 basically this is if you do not copy the 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.660
 commands and you're not going to have to 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.670
 change the coordinates here for that 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:22.820
 and good guys, I hope you liked the 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.820
 video and nothing until another goodbye
