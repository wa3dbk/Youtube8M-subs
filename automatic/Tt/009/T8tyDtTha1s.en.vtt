like I have right behind the camera here

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
like I have right behind the camera here
you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> learn<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.560> functions<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you can make it learn the functions of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.690 
you can make it learn the functions of
that<00:01:08.460> fan<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.780> remote<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.700> even

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that fan off the remote for it and even

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
if it doesn't have the code for it in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
if it doesn't have the code for it in
the<00:01:14.070> remote<00:01:14.340> itself<00:01:14.670> it'll<00:01:15.090> still<00:01:15.360> learn

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the remote itself it'll still learn

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
the remote itself it'll still learn
codes<00:01:15.990> even<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> doesn't<00:01:17.220> support<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
codes even if it doesn't support that

universal remotes that are basic the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.550 
universal remotes that are basic the
most<00:02:11.190> basic<00:02:11.610> things<00:02:11.790> you'll<00:02:12.000> ever<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> mean

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
most basic things you'll ever see I mean

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.730 
most basic things you'll ever see I mean
they<00:02:14.560> basically<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.300> TVs<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:17.530> can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
they basically do like TVs they can

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.090 
they basically do like TVs they can
basically<00:02:18.130> control<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.820> TV<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.920> maybe<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
basically control a TV and maybe a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.680 
basically control a TV and maybe a
stereo<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.760> that's<00:02:21.940> about<00:02:22.090> it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
stereo and that's about it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.860 
stereo and that's about it
but<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.770> much<00:02:24.430> much<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:25.060> now

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
but this one can do much much more now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110 
but this one can do much much more now
as<00:02:26.020> far<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.320> length<00:02:26.740> goes<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.520> kind<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.820> big

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
as far as length goes it is kind of big

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.620 
as far as length goes it is kind of big
if<00:02:28.660> your<00:02:28.900> hand<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.590> see<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.130> my<00:02:30.640> hand

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
if your hand as you can see here my hand

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.660 
if your hand as you can see here my hand
is<00:02:31.840> at<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.080> very<00:02:32.290> bottom<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.280> kind<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
is at the very bottom so it is kind of a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.750 
is at the very bottom so it is kind of a
big<00:02:33.850> remote<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.010> said<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.370> has<00:02:36.400> all

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
big remote but as I said it has all

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.560 
big remote but as I said it has all
major<00:02:37.030> functions<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.270> see<00:02:40.450> on

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
major functions on it and you can see on

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.490 
major functions on it and you can see on
the<00:02:40.690> front<00:02:40.870> here<00:02:42.240> see<00:02:43.240> if<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> will<00:02:43.630> uh<00:02:43.780> focus

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the front here see if it will uh focus

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.100 
the front here see if it will uh focus
in<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:44.800> probably<00:02:45.040> not<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.910> got<00:02:46.210> on<00:02:46.450> three

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
in here probably not it's got on three

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.840 
in here probably not it's got on three
senses<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.130> that's<00:02:48.250> probably<00:02:48.430> for<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
senses on it and that's probably for the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.500 
senses on it and that's probably for the
learning<00:02:49.180> function<00:02:49.630> as<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> explained<00:02:50.350> it
