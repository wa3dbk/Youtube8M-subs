00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.859
One of the longest-running names in Citroen’s
current lineup, the C4 range has seen its

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.739
fair share of both hits and misses since it
was first introduced all the way back in 2004.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.739
With the introduction of a new facelift for
2015, Citroen has turned its attention back

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.870
towards the C4 in an effort to keep it relevant
in one of the fastest-growing market segments.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.609
Is it any good? Let’s take a look
The facelifted C4 features an updated front

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.100
end, with the signature Citroen chevrons now
incorporated into the bonnet for a slicker,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.549
more modern look.
It’s certainly less frumpy looking than

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:49.579
its predecessors, with a slimmed down design,
a new LED lighting signature and the choice

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.439
of new alloy wheels in various sizes, but
what about the rest of it?

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:58.500
Three trim levels are available and standard
kit is decent, with even the entry-level Touch

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.360
model getting cruise control with a speed
limiter, air conditioning and a CD player

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.239
with an aux-in connection.
The range-topping Flair trim, which is the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.649
one we’ve got, comes with tinted rear windows,
chrome door mirrors and a host of other kit

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.580
like rear parking sensors, a 12v socket for
your phone and automatic lights.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.050
Sitting in the cabin, the updated C4 now features
a sweeping one-piece dashboard with a smartly-placed

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.400
centre console. All the fittings are sturdy
and decent, while this model also features

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.969
a new seven-inch touchscreen with DAB digital
radio, navigation and hands-free phone functionality.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.079
Seats are comfortable and supportive, while
buyers can also choose to upgrade theirs with

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:37.060
a massaging function and electric lumbar adjustment
if they so choose.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.009
Getting into the rear, there’s a decent
amount of legroom though the transmission

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.869
tunnel in the middle is quite intrusive. In
this particular car, headroom might also be

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.799
a little cramped for taller passengers, though
we suspect the optional panoramic sunroof

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.749
eats into the space on offer.
The 408-litre boot, one of the largest in

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.419
the C4’s market segment is spacious and
easy enough to load, while the rear seats

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:02.529
fold down with a simple pull of the handle
to further increase storage space, though

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:06.770
they don’t fold entirely flat and there’s
an ever-so-slightly annoying bump at the bottom

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.849
that might make loading flat packs a little
tricky.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.020
On the go, the C4 offers a relaxed drive,
though it could be considered a little unenthusiastic.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.270
The steering tends to be a little vague at
speed, while the suspension’s just a little

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.069
spongy, particularly in the corners and under
braking.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.370
That said, if you’re in the market for something
a little sportier, the C4 is never really

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.750
going to pop up on your radar. As a commuter
car, however, it’s composed, comfortable

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.420
and refined, with a smooth drive and very
little road noise inside.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.620
Engine options include a choice of two petrol
engines and three diesels, along with the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.209
option of both manual and automatic gearboxes.
This car comes outfitted with a turbocharged

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.819
1.2-litre PureTech engine, which Citroen claims
offers the same performance as a much larger

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.230
unit, despite its small size.
In that respect, it’s hard to argue; punchy

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.269
even at low revs, it offers 130hp of strong
performance with a delightful helping of torque

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.390
that catapults the car forward when you put
your foot down.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.159
It’s also dead quiet for a three-pot engine
and doesn’t make too much fuss, even at

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.459
motorway speeds, and can deliver around 60mpg;
our only complaint is that the throw on the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:19.720
manual gearbox is a little long.
Although it doesn’t offer the most compelling

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.849
drive around, if you’re in the market for
a stylish and capable family hatchback, the

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.489
Citroen C4 does a pretty equitable job of
it.

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.489
Some of its rivals might beat it to the punch
in terms of sportiness, driveability and stand-out

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.100
features, but with plenty of kit, an impressively
sized boot and frugal but entertaining engines,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.400
the C4 offers a great all-round option.
