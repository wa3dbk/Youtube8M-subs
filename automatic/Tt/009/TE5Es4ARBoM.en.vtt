00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.000
 we have the taste and of course the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.730
 thanks for power from ezeiza 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.629
 nothing less than the Chinese maidana frames 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.029
 after this historical conquest this 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.460
 7th ottawa and quiet china we were 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.390
 calm and happy also to have 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.230
 won this fight so cute and so hard and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.669
 long-awaited I was referring to quiet by 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.530
 him for the journalistic siege that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.390
 you had after such a fight and 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.560
 but you can tell that you took everything 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.720
 as calmly as that 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.050
 from the hebron charges in front of 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.050
 the fight 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.320
 I did not know there was going to be so many 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.280
 So many journalists and nobody expected 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.940
 to come and we did but we had 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.950
 many journalists of our fight do not 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.970
 It seems I do not care I do my job 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.150
 and good 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.850
 I do not have drama 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.330
 besides the boxing that was the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 preparation with 9 garcía thinking about the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.440
 frame thinking about the charged ones of broner 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.620
 that you are going to want to get out of the fight 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.090
 this was what psychologically 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.430
 I pass through your head that no time 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.680
 got out of the fight but all the time 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.400
 superb loving me but it did not help me 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.500
 I grew up in those things, I'm not interested 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.320
 because I'm raised in other things in 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 some worse things that I've gone through and that 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.030
 I'm not interested in one or nothing but 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.050
 and also Robert always told me 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.600
 is saying calm down because I 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.210
 and they are they are like this says it is of all blacks 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.780
 they are like that but when you clean your hand 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.940
 and there they begin to shrink the opinion 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.979
 widespread was the Chinese has to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.319
 win before the fifth of the sixth or 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.510
 of the seventh lap when he flew what 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.910
 you threw yourself so fast and he passed the third or 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.100
 fourth round it was noticed that little 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.319
 you started to graduate the physicists you gave him 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.530
 account that the fight was going to be long and 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.780
 that you had to keep well but 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.150
 because I put his hand in the first the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.610
 second because he trusted but after 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.580
 in the black and I go and lay floor 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:40.040
 exhibited alive did not stop playing handles 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.760
 so if robert told me to calm down 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.220
 and already called box reads and when you can 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.530
 put your hand this l do not stay there 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.800
 because he's going to be his job and it's 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.290
 fast then this what it says what 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.630
 I iron him I did not go on anything and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.580
 when you could and half over and now you see 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.350
 here friends maybe what it gave you 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.970
 tranquility was that in the past 15 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 seconds the best hand without districts 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.790
 votes 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.170
 if it's in the last 15 seconds my 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.290
 coach tells me to close the last 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.840
 15 seconds close it because he goes wants 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.120
 close lingán to the round with that then 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.569
 beat closed logo and well I say and what 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.579
 closed brings quiet all round and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.859
 the last 15 seconds I tried to 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.269
 close it with everything in the moments 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.819
 Critics for any boxer 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.250
 Argentinian that I fight outside they are 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.620
 the last rounds the dale was heard 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.260
 Chinese to Chinese outside but it was seen by 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.810
 example in the 11th rum that maybe in the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.180
 I will not know if you noticed or tiredness 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.220
 well that you wanted to finish it off as 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.829
 you did in the twelfth how did you live 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.500
 that final part of the fight the part 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.720
 final had strong he also came out to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.189
 define the fight because there is no other 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.599

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.709

 keep going because if not no 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.770
 I think that putting out strength and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.600
 the heart and egg as we say but 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.290
