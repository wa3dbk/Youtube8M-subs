00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Ayd Asraf Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.539
 Have you ever been to a swimming pool, 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.089
 Comfortable and warm, thinker, 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.247
 "Man, it's great to be an astronaut! 

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:21.706
 You can float in outer space, 

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:23.366
 Looking towards the earth and everything. 

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.699
 That would be great! " 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.355
 But this is not the case at all. 

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:27.674
 If you are in outer space, 

00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:28.934
 Then you will revolve around the earth, 

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:31.170
 In the so-called free fall. 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.468
 In fact you land on the ground. 

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.890
 Well, think about this for a moment. 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.488
 This is the feeling you get 

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:37.450
 When you are at the top of the roller coaster, 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.286
 You will be, like, 

00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:41.602
 The only difference is that you do this all the time 

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:42.871
 Which revolves around the earth 

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.490
 For two 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.021
 three 

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:44.619
 Four 

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:45.147
 Hours, 

00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:45.610
 days, 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.658
 Or as much as it takes, right? 

00:00:46.658 --> 00:00:48.371
 So how is the orbit in orbit? 

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.320
 Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.369
 He had this idea, 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:52.441
 A little mental experience. 

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:53.905
 To take a cannon, 

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:54.994
 And put it on top of a hill. 

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:56.283
 If you shoot the cannonball, 

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:57.980
 You will move away a bit. 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.774
 But if it is launched more forcefully, 

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:01.620
 You will move far enough to land 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.837
 A little further than the curvature of the earth. 

00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:04.620
 Well, you can imagine 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.596
 If triggered by much greater force 

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.916
 They will go their way around the earth 

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:10.047
 Come back, Boom! 

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.886
 And hit you on your ass or something like that. 

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:13.109
 Let's highlight the way back 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.632
 We put you in a small satellite 

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:16.215
 Above the north pole of the earth 

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:17.591
 And consider that the north is above you. 

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:19.465
 You are about to fall and hit the ground. 

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:23.795
 But you're actually moving sideways really fast. 

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:24.962
 So, when you fall down, 

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:26.339
 You will make a mistake. 

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:28.207
 You will end up on the side of the earth, 

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:29.560
 Fallen, 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.558
 Now the earth pulls you back to the sides. 

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.819
 Well, the earth pulls you away 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:34.714
 And you fall again, 

00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:36.625
 And make the earth again, 

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.153
 And now you are underground. 

00:01:38.153 --> 00:01:39.375
 And the earth will pull you up, 

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:40.907
 And you're still moving sideways. 

00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:42.463
 So you will miss the ground again. 

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:43.961
 Now, you are on the other side of the earth, 

00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.686
 Move up and the ground pulls you to its sides. 

00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:48.765
 Well, you'll fall by the side, 

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.210
 But you will move up and err. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.024
 And here you are renewed above the globe, 

00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:54.333
 Above the North Pole, 

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.582
 Floating sideways and falling, 

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:57.728
 And yes, I was caught. 

00:01:57.728 --> 00:02:01.059
 You will continue to fail to reach the ground, because you are moving very quickly. 

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:03.483
 In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. 

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:05.642
 They always fall to the ground, 

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.312
 And always make mistakes, 

00:02:07.312 --> 00:02:09.574
 Thus, they fall all the time. 

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:10.485
 They feel they are falling, 

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:12.261
 So you'll have to skip it. 

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.395
 So, technically speaking, if you run fast enough and stumble, 

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:18.907
 It is possible to be absent from the ground. 

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.169
 But there is a big problem. 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:24.006
 First, you have to move at 8 kilometers per second. 

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:26.262
 That's 18,000 miles per hour, 

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.881
 Just over 23 Mach! 

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:29.836
 The second problem: 

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.263
 If you move so fast, 

00:02:31.263 --> 00:02:32.931
 Yes, you will revolve around the Earth 

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.426
 And return from where it started, 

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:36.560
 But there is a huge amount of air in the way, 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.978
 Well, less than people and stuff. 

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:40.099
 So, you will burn as a result of atmospheric friction. 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.704
 So, I do not recommend it.
