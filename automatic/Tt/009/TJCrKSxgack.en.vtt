00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.899
 Speech, I'm Rodrigo, and today we 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.639
 Let's talk a little more about one of the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.050
 subjects of the moment that are the new ones in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.969
 asus headphones 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
 the company has released some devices 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.470
 different is what is legal because 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.330
 diversify the line but it is something that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 may cause confusion in some users 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 or doubt about which to buy 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.199
 so this video from my simple version 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 on each of these devices already clear 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.859
 I am considering that the person in that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 so I'm not going 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.279
 compare with devices from other 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 companies are seeing on the screen in order 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.690
 increasing the devices that Asus will 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 have a market from now on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 note that symphony 5 is down there 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 yes it will continue to be sold already 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 was confirmed and at the top are two 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 devices with a different color because 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 I consider them to be a separate case but 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 We talk about each one of us. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 first clear model is symphony sim 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 which was launched last year and which 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 now kind of serves as a model for 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 entry it was released as 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 intermediary but now stands there as the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.439
 cheaper than asus and I would say that it is 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 for those who want to have a first 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.970
 smartphone or for those who have a phone 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 very bad and that is an experience I went 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.780
 of the light android without caring 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.490
 things like 4g for a lot of people not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 It really matters, that's when we go. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 produce phones 2 laws is in the middle 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.619
 who despite having that fancy laser name 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 is the simplest among the new ones 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.880
 were shown 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.040
 it has 2 gb of ram and one chip per 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.110
 example of new engine g 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.900
 only that the asus prepared two trumps that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.509
 They can be very good for many people. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.909
 the first is the 55-inch screen for 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.009
 who wants to immerse themselves in the wave of big screens and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 the second the laser focus on the camera 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 back is as if he was saying there 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.189
 Look this one is a little cheaper than 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.799
 that the motor g that has 2 gb of ram 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.259
 only he has a bead and has a laser focus 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.570
 that are of the features that must be 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.670
 for a lot of people and I think it 's 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 a smartphone that will serve to those who 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.009
 want to have an up to date 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.500
 world of the handset and with cameras 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.570
 better than the light 4g there we have 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.320
 two models in the house of fifteen hundred 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.739
 real 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.190
 the zen fone self and the symphony 2 in model 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.140
 of 16 gb 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.240
 the internal training and in this case you 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.030
 have to make a choice for you to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.060
 front camera is very important to you. 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.710
 power even to have 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.270
 a front camera that is above the 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.610
 because the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.400
 symphony self is what we could 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.100
 call an advanced intermediary if you 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.260
 You even want a smartphone 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.990
 own cameras with camera flash 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.330
 front and high resolution the rest of the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.160
 specifications will not make it ugly 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 not very good but if you prioritize 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.920
 even the power beauty aiea without phone 2 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.140
 on the 16 gigabyte model because it is already a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.780
 advanced phone with processor 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.000
 with four gigabytes of ram 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.610
 and that it still has a front camera 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.170
 cool 5 megapixels which is a new standard 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.630
 This year for heaven I did 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.380
 although not having the flash is a decision 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.750
 that will do between power or 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.470
 storage and the front camera that is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.180
 that you want 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.760
 in the next phase we have the same without 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.930
 phone 2 now only with 32 gb of 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.880
 internal storage 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.410
 it costs a little more expensive and is simple 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.630
 for those who want more space to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.489
 install applications without worry 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.170
 I say apps because it's good to stress 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.270
 all the phones I've spoken to 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.820
 micro sd now to expand the 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.790
 memory will only be a help and media 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.500
 no photos and music and video and on top 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.290
 we have the symphony two flights and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.080
 Usem was 2 deluxe special edition which 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.520
 are those who have let's say win 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.930
 less palpable 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.670
 You'll pay more to have one. 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.260
 storage that is absurd 128 gigas and 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.650
 256 gb respectively 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.360
 a visual that is more it is then to 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.790
 a lot of people this is going to be important 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.640
 who wants to pay more for it and in the case 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.440
 symphony 2 deluxe is a special fan it 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.410
 has a processor with a frequency of one 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.260
 bit higher as I said are better 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.760
 so I guess it does not matter 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.500
 both for most people is 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.140
 curious that all these new gadgets 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.080
 already enter head on the wave of the screens 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.220
 large all of them have 5.5 affiliated one 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.019
 very similar size and many people 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.570
 who do not like this size 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.770
 prefer 4 with 74 with 5 maximum 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.449
 five people are going to have to swallow right? 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.030
 and testing the house of a book to see 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.220
 if it is going to adapt, although many 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.159
 times the best impression we have only 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.229
 after using in person a 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.900
 after a while not well 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.159
 fast one day a friend but anyway this is 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.960
 a reality and I think we have to 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.720
 to adapt to it even to that they 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.389
 they saw that only the iphone flash that is the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.370
 advanced intermediary so to speak 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.949
 only it has the front camera flash 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.310
 more goodbye also released an accessory 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.470
 119 flash that cost 50 tale and it 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.610
 basically additional scrotal to all 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.319
 the devices 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.440
 so let's see that this is an additional 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.909
 already seen embedded in the celf but will be a 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.650
 big problem for those who want to have 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.289
 light on the front 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.060
 this accessory is cheap and so the 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.039
 Reviewing wins is good too an end 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.050
 Of course I did not mention symphony 6 but 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.690
 Asus did not say anything about it is likely 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.240
 let him leave me because he's kind of 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.190
 1199 which is displaced by the costing 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.430
 version of 32 gigas you almost already 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.030
 buy a self version or until the symphony 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.009
 2 Reverse gigas 16 which causes 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.270
 the six is ​​not the best of business 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.490
 but I imagine he's still there 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.840
 sold while supplies last and 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.460
 the people on the video hope 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.599
 I like it if you liked it click liked it 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.310
 its the first time that the click channel 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.469
 sign that the next track 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.650
 videos on youtube are social pleasing 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.650
 today I'm staying here in Brazil 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.650
