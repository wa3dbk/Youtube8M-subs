00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.370
 introductory video at destiny to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 railwayman 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.370
 I thought I'm still here 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.870
 an introductory video which is important at 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.340
 most warner to note 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.710
 what do you have to look for because I have 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.170
 always on my channel new entrances 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.530
 who do not know exactly what is going on 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.270
 That's why I explain that 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.059
 ironworker that stands here if the gate 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 then an event is open 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.030
 in between times I appear show 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.030
 directly where you can walk in there 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 Normally the door is locked 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 then you can be here but then 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.519
 the railroad is active and you can too 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 lord sour because important go here 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:03.510
 is to say that railroaders are here 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.790
 Welcome if you are concerned 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 depending on the armor and the weapons 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.380
 that you take with you that means armor 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.720
 the maximum value as I here now 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.300
 have maximum value on it then cashed 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 Overall less harm if you are now 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.110
 but when he arrives this is not 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 quite so tragic because the armor the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.820
 Do not do such a massive job 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 difference but important are the weapons 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.230
 if you go in with the weapons into the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.300
 Eisenbahner then looks that everyone 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.320
 really have the maximum of the weapon 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.750
 that is currently 331 that takes everything 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.990
 prefer the weapons with a 31 damage 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.220
 with instead of the deep 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 Of course there are exceptions like that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.820
 It's growing so it's still you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.490
 very strong in the pvp and also in the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.930
 Eisenbahner but that looks that you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.300
 maximum take away so now to the apps 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.350
 You can see you can then diverse 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.690
 Buy items railroader level 3 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.770
 Level 4 to level 5 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.299
 and yes, buy things you climb the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.790
 wrestling in which the game is completed 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.400
 a game you win gives 50 points 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.010
 and a game that you can imagine 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.319
 there are no points but there are 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.290
 emblem that you then exchanged if you 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.989
 again a game wins that means that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.959
 then gives 40 points of experience again 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.700
 in addition to the victory that is if that there 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.359
 loses and loses several times does that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.379
 nothing you just collect the coins 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.400
 and if you win again 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.290
 will automatically be direct 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.870
 you do not change quite like that 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.150
 many experience points but 40 is 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.230
 better than nothing 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.090
 then there are little things you can do 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.930
 must pay attention 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.780
 the badge parapet and the badge 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.150
 Wool grab or stop the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.129
 Class objects if you keep the persistence 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.799
 give the ten per class item 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.829
 points experience bonus that is looking 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.560
 that you claim the buys and until the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.930
 next railroad expected and then 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.430
 Also take back and see if it 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.069
 It is important to have it with you 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:19.579
 the ten percent really do something 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:22.160
 then we would have bought even harder 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.139
 every time that lasts twelve hours 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.470
 and gives another experience 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.900
 However, bonus it differently the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.650
 is on tuesday when it starts at 10 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.440
 percent 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.099
 on wednesday the following day 15 percent 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.099
 the next day 25 40 60 100 and 150 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.329
 So on Monday the last day 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.489
 I throw the numbers down in the 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.810
 description 1 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.400
 so you know on what day how much 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.069
 percent bonus gets call bonus where 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.810
 you then get more in the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.790
 description I threw it 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.889
 then a little hint someone looks 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.459
 that she takes the mounties with her 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:04.549
 the foreshortenings of the railroader and the 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.790
 met because the call to 100 probate 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.199
 train and also look forward to being in the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.239
 twilight when you have that off 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.729
 because with the dawn you get 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.209
 again a winning and loot trains 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.669
 then do not give 100 but about 124 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.260
 call and that's one 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.360
 essential ingredient if you are six 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.620
 from the total cup so look that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.620
 Above all, it has made the twilight 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.190
 the weapons that are there I will 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.680
 gradually a playlist also in the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 this video is now in there 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.300
 I will use the weapon gradually 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.220
 look and they are good 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.920
 they are not good as they come to dice 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.480
 that they are getting better 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.860
 you'll see that in the playlist 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.170
 after which arms I now 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.270
 to get soon and me too 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.760
 can snap and upset are 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.930
 accordingly many videos turn that 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.820
 of course I will gradually 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.260
 fill in now for the dice for 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.690
 all who do not know that you can 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.980
 Weapons down here only forge 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.650
 ironman weapons you can turn around 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.770
 forge 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.270
 but that's worth a lot 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.970
 will now see here directly at one 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.340
 mg there are other skills everywhere 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.510
 on it is always the same mg and that 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.610
 I have now with the railroader 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.860
 bought with this step so again 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.540
 completely different and I just have that 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.100
 repeatedly diced for two lights 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.420
 Particle and you always get back 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.380
 new sat on new bonuses and can 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.380
 So pick the best 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.450
 I think that was it in the big and 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.770
 All about the introduction of the railway 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.850
 or there is not much to say 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.840
 also want to keep as short as possible 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.980
 if you have any questions, it seems 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.620
 Just in the comments I will 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.120
 like to answer 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.090
 In that sense that 's it 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.220
 Thank you for listening and video 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.410
 watch if the video caught you 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.650
 also leave a lighter or an abo me 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.490
