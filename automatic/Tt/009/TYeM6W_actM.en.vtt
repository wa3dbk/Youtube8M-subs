00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
recoil but I'm starting to wonder if

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
recoil but I'm starting to wonder if
it's<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> recoil<00:01:02.519> or<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.449> feedback<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
it's the recoil or it's the feedback you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's the recoil or it's the feedback you
get<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.410> recoil<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.980> a<00:01:05.010> lot<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.220> us

what I want you to think about there

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.480 
what I want you to think about there
what<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.990> saw<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.680> was<00:02:44.830> spraying<00:02:45.190> that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
what you saw as I was spraying that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.220 
what you saw as I was spraying that
ak-47<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.510> my<00:02:46.600> own<00:02:46.720> server

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
ak-47 in my own server

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
ak-47 in my own server
you<00:02:47.500> saw<00:02:47.740> how<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:47.980> entire<00:02:48.340> screen<00:02:48.820> reacted<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
you saw how the entire screen reacted to

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.080 
you saw how the entire screen reacted to
it<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.440> crosshair<00:02:50.950> reacted<00:02:51.430> everything<00:02:51.910> was

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it the crosshair reacted everything was

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.730 
it the crosshair reacted everything was
kind<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.570> jittery<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.260> every<00:02:53.470> time<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
kind of like jittery like every time you

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.260 
kind of like jittery like every time you
fire<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.100> shot<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.400> kind<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.580> feel<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.209> I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
fire that shot you kind of feel it and I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.699 
fire that shot you kind of feel it and I
think<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.690> big<00:02:55.840> part<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.260> game<00:02:56.500> and

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
think it's a big part of the game and

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.050 
think it's a big part of the game and
that's<00:02:57.160> something<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.640> feels<00:02:57.730> really

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
that's something it feels really

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.729 
that's something it feels really
rewarding<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.780> makes<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.110> shot<00:02:59.350> even<00:02:59.620> more

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
rewarding it makes that shot even more

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.780 
rewarding it makes that shot even more
rewarding<00:02:59.890> that's<00:03:00.400> it

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
rewarding that's it

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.130 
rewarding that's it
I<00:03:00.820> believe<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.300> ties<00:03:01.450> into<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.690> lot<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.959> things

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
I believe it ties into a lot of things

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.229 
I believe it ties into a lot of things
that<00:03:02.260> people<00:03:02.320> complain<00:03:02.830> about<00:03:02.970> one<00:03:03.970> being<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
that people complain about one being the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.729 
that people complain about one being the
consistency<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:04.930> think<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.470> hard<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
consistency I think it's just hard to

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.250 
consistency I think it's just hard to
tell<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.300> doesn't<00:03:07.300> make<00:03:07.390> any<00:03:07.540> sense<00:03:07.660> let<00:03:08.170> me

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
tell that doesn't make any sense let me

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.960 
tell that doesn't make any sense let me
just<00:03:08.440> jump<00:03:08.530> over<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.800> csgo<00:03:09.070> clip<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.610> you'll

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
just jump over the csgo clip and you'll

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.890 
just jump over the csgo clip and you'll
kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.150> see<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.360> difference<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.810> then

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
kind of see the difference and then

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:42.240 
kind of see the difference and then
we'll<00:03:10.989> do<00:03:11.080> both<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.410> same<00:03:11.560> time

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.350 

all<00:03:43.250> right<00:03:43.400> last<00:03:43.610> but<00:03:43.700> not<00:03:43.880> least<00:03:44.120> we're<00:03:44.240> going

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
all right last but not least we're going

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.670 
all right last but not least we're going
to<00:03:44.420> do<00:03:44.480> both<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.780> same<00:03:44.990> time<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.470> want<00:03:45.620> you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
to pay attention to not only the spray

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.220

patterns there but I want you look at

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.680 
patterns there but I want you look at
the<00:03:48.290> single<00:03:48.650> shots<00:03:48.950> I've<00:03:49.130> fire<00:03:49.690> side-by-side

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
understand that the goal is not to make

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.130 
understand that the goal is not to make
another<00:04:34.790> counter-strike<00:04:35.210> 1.6<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.080> know

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
another counter-strike 1.6 and I know

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.650 
another counter-strike 1.6 and I know
that<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.620> developers<00:04:37.430> hidden<00:04:37.970> paths<00:04:38.150> involve

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
it's really important that not just the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.310 
it's really important that not just the
gun<00:04:52.340> reacts<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:53.210> notice<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.660> gun<00:04:53.900> if<00:04:54.170> you're

1.6<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.850> just<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:14.390> much<00:05:14.540> more<00:05:14.840> just<00:05:15.020> analog

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
1.6 it's just so much more just analog

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.560 
1.6 it's just so much more just analog
in<00:05:15.950> disconnecting<00:05:16.550> this<00:05:16.670> is<00:05:16.790> bam-bam-bam<00:05:17.420> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
whole screen shakes and i know it sounds

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.190 
whole screen shakes and i know it sounds
really<00:05:19.910> weird<00:05:20.060> but<00:05:20.330> i<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.630> has<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.780> lot<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.140> do

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
really weird but i that has a lot to do

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.900 
really weird but i that has a lot to do
with<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.410> recoil<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.920> not<00:05:22.040> only<00:05:22.160> that<00:05:22.460> with

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
with the recoil and not only that with

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.600 
with the recoil and not only that with
csgo<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.420> notice<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:24.380> as<00:05:24.650> you<00:05:24.680> spray<00:05:25.250> if<00:05:25.490> it

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
csgo you notice that as you spray if it

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.820 
csgo you notice that as you spray if it
goes<00:05:25.730> left<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.150> right<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:27.110> bullets<00:05:27.470> just<00:05:27.530> go

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
goes left and right the bullets just go

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.930 
goes left and right the bullets just go
left<00:05:28.040> and<00:05:28.160> right<00:05:28.220> your<00:05:28.460> screen<00:05:28.790> doesn't

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
left and right your screen doesn't

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.760 
left and right your screen doesn't
really<00:05:29.180> sway<00:05:29.600> if<00:05:29.960> once<00:05:30.200> again<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.560> look<00:05:30.590> at

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
really sway if once again you look at

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.560 
really sway if once again you look at
the<00:05:30.860> 1.6<00:05:31.400> patterns<00:05:31.790> as<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.000> spray<00:05:32.420> you'll

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
the 1.6 patterns as you spray you'll

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.940 
the 1.6 patterns as you spray you'll
notice<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.870> screen<00:05:33.020> kind<00:05:33.260> of<00:05:33.320> jerks<00:05:33.620> one<00:05:33.830> way

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
notice the screen kind of jerks one way

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.770 
notice the screen kind of jerks one way
or<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.040> other<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.430> kind<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.610> helps<00:05:35.000> decide

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
or the other so it kind of helps decide

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.080 
or the other so it kind of helps decide
or<00:05:36.230> helps<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.920> realize<00:05:37.340> where<00:05:37.670> your<00:05:37.880> spray

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
or helps you realize where your spray

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.210 
or helps you realize where your spray
patterns<00:05:38.420> going<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.200> I<00:05:39.620> know<00:05:39.680> we<00:05:39.860> all<00:05:40.040> learn

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
patterns going and I know we all learn

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.560 
patterns going and I know we all learn
the<00:05:40.280> spray<00:05:40.580> pattern<00:05:40.760> something<00:05:41.210> we<00:05:41.300> can<00:05:41.420> just

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
the spray pattern something we can just

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.080 
the spray pattern something we can just
learn<00:05:41.780> but<00:05:42.410> it's<00:05:42.890> kind<00:05:43.220> of<00:05:43.310> subconscious<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.060> a

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
learn but it's kind of subconscious to a

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.520 
learn but it's kind of subconscious to a
lot<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.330> us<00:05:44.450> one<00:05:44.600> point<00:05:44.810> six<00:05:45.050> players<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.440> we

lot of us one point six players that we

lot of us one point six players that we

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
information the wrong way because I mean

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.270 
information the wrong way because I mean
it's<00:06:03.020> our<00:06:03.110> fault<00:06:03.410> to<00:06:03.590> be<00:06:03.680> honest<00:06:04.010> what<00:06:04.160> we're

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
it's our fault to be honest what we're

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.800 
it's our fault to be honest what we're
doing<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:04.670> we're<00:06:04.850> saying<00:06:05.090> three<00:06:05.300> coils<00:06:05.510> wrong

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
doing is we're saying three coils wrong

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.510 
doing is we're saying three coils wrong
well<00:06:06.050> I<00:06:06.260> think<00:06:06.380> it's<00:06:06.710> something<00:06:06.980> else

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
well I think it's something else

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.640 
well I think it's something else
I<00:06:07.550> noticed<00:06:08.150> there<00:06:08.300> is<00:06:08.330> a<00:06:08.450> blog<00:06:08.720> just<00:06:09.410> today

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
I noticed there is a blog just today

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.000 
I noticed there is a blog just today
actually<00:06:09.830> talking<00:06:10.610> about<00:06:10.850> how<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:12.650> recoil<00:06:12.950> is

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.080 
actually talking about how the recoil is
going<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.190> be<00:06:13.250> tweaked<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.580> think<00:06:13.820> we<00:06:13.940> may<00:06:14.060> need

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
going to be tweaked I think we may need

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.430 
going to be tweaked I think we may need
to<00:06:14.240> look<00:06:14.300> at<00:06:14.480> another<00:06:14.630> little<00:06:14.840> bit<00:06:14.900> area<00:06:15.140> that

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440
