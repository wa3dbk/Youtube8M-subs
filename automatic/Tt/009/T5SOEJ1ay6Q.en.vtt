00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.960
 Good day fighters with you and 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.090
 five and in this video I would like 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.160
 bring to your attention a new mini 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.070
 Warface based game 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.910
 but before I am front of the main part I 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.310
 I'll start with the history in antiquity people are very 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.070
 scrupulous treated the name is considered 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.319
 that having learned the true name of the person you are 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.280
 automatically finds over it some 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.559
 kind of power 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.710
 when you know someone else's sound 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.600
 entities any word you have addressed to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.510
 that person becomes a word to him 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.729
 forces and so the one who knew the true name 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.929
 the rival became the winner without a fight 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.829
 let's imagine our 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.559
 progress 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.199
 This is our true name and that 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.079
 You can change this icon at any time. 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.780
 first name badge middle name and last name is a stripe 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 let's say some in particular and i 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.550
 I think that choosing the right 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.680
 achievements you get some kind of bonus and 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.430
 play becomes much easier and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.370
 nicer 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.080
 maybe it's a self-suggestion but you can 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.750
 gain partial power over 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.500
 foe and get him hidden 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.410
 bonuses and as you might have guessed 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 from the title my game is called me 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.600
 repeat and what and she wears immediately 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.000
 three useful development features 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.610
 short term memory dithering 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 opponent and good mood for you 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.900
 and for your teammates and forests of clans and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.850
 so what is the essence of a mini game like 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.520
 nor strange but to repeat 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.740
 purification opponent or teammate wherein 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 do it this way quickly 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.000
 check the combination of achievements and this 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 about three seconds and then right there 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.159
 make the desired combination in 15-20 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.050
 seconds not returning and not peeping 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.670
 our main purpose is 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.890
 really help you learn 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.470
 understand the best achievements and what 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 herself 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.979
 she will make your short-term memory 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 many times stronger in this mini game 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.420
 play only if you think that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.580
 the amount of your achievements is enough 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.310
 vast and you are sure you can 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.220
 repeat the achievements of other players in 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.380
 This game has three difficulty modes. 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.020
 simple achievements hard achievements and 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.480
 personal achievements are naturally simple 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.220
 achievements are based on what can 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.980
 get any player on this or that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.290
 rank or during certain events 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.780
 for receiving and copying chord 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.880
 achievements you need to sweat like I 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
 I mean grenadiers mozholomov and so 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.740
 Further, but to personal achievement you can 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
 include any stuffing stuffing on 5 10 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.300
 thousand with one or another weapon and 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 really powerful achievements such 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.070
 as an equalizer 2 and a half pieces 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.920
 brains or 10,000 grenadiers therefore 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.900
 I usually omit level 3 difficulty 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.990
 how can one player already have us 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.940
 bit saved and another saiga ubih achivki 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.630
 equivalent but in essence the assignment is not 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.920
 done 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.269
 and if you can not copy 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 achievements and lost 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.040
 you can play this game together 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.900
 three or even the whole room with 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.239
 points or some other 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.550
 discuss conditions first 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.739
 Achievements do not bet because I'm sure 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.190
 that everyone in the room that still exists Th 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.590
 inject 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.230
 who stuffed and gathered all that already 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.380
 you can only collect and start betting 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.019
 one at a time puts his combinations 2 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.650
 repeats in case of failure wins 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.750
 achivki 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.160
 case ideally repeated chaff 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 wins 3 peter 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.870
 I hope someone has a role to explain to you 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.790
 You will not need for such a regime I 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.890
 I advise you to turn to a token 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.360
 since they are usually 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.730
 cause of loss 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.430
 for example, I now put a token on 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.970
 thousand karon and closed it with 10 place in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.190
 ranking 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.040
 since my rivals are pretty high 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.560
 ranks, then everyone thought that I put 10 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.959
 thousand cows and naturally lost 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.750
 as you can see there is an opportunity to develop 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.290
 also strategic thinking and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.420
 attentiveness and the most wonderful in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.090
 pvp matches this diys orientation 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.880
 the enemy when you copy his achivki 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.669
 you know his true name you have over 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.530
 him power especially if the enemy sees 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.380
 that the Persian kills him with his 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.060
 achievements especially terrible on anyone 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.490
 when you can repeat 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.530
 total clan achivku enemy then you 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.139
 take all advantages from 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.240
 the adversary as if saying I'm the same as 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:44.030
 you but i can even better so i told 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.700
 you about the mini-game and repeat what in that 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.410
 my friends and I have been playing for half a year already 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.650
 I hope that she will cheer you up 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.740
 and develop your mental skills and 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.750
 you were hey five and remember the climax 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.820
 repeat what ntov is achieved only 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.050
 then when you write in chat 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.050
 Player's nickname and Yaschenko's victory alert 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.050
 copied
