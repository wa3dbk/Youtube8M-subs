 not having square fish of oysters 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.030
 for example if it is something cyclical that would go very well 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.390
 or in a dessert of in chocolate our pearls that we are going to make now 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.940
 good as I always say the imagination 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.220
 is the one that has to take us to do different things, especially 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.830
 to practice 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 well, once 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.610
 we want the strawberries and we go to creatures

 it is very important that it is very well crushed 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.030

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.140
 you want a little sugar, did not send him to lima 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.250

 eye 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.780
 the agency adds no 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690
 a little water 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.020
 until we have the desired texture 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.220
 muddy has weighed then I'm going to remove it for and I'm going to throw 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.299
 see how we have been 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.139
 immediately give yourself a little liquid 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.849
 loas to put on fire 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.049

 keep in mind that your courage both with droppers and with a syringe 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.959
 although we have work but hamilton the truth is that with the bottle I find 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.570

 fruit of the most complicated procedures 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.879
 then little by little we go catching 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.069
 the pulse 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.540
 a year when they are done 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.309
