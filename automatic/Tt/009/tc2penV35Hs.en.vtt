characteristics about this sharpener is
you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> set<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.270> sharpening<00:00:39.989> angle

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you have to set the sharpening angle

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.420 
you have to set the sharpening angle
using<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> carbide<00:00:41.670> slot<00:00:42.559> here<00:00:43.559> before<00:00:44.190> ever

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
using the carbide slot here before ever

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020 
using the carbide slot here before ever
going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> electric<00:00:46.010> slot<00:00:47.010> which<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
going to the electric slot which has the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
going to the electric slot which has the
ceramic<00:00:48.480> air<00:00:48.600> locking<00:00:48.960> wheels<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> reason

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
ceramic air locking wheels the reason

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
ceramic air locking wheels the reason
that<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.079> ceramic<00:00:52.469> air

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that is is because the ceramic air

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
that is is because the ceramic air
locking<00:00:52.890> wheels<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.969> abrasive<00:00:54.690> enough

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
locking wheels are not abrasive enough

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.500 
locking wheels are not abrasive enough
to<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.920> remove<00:00:56.699> enough<00:00:56.940> metal<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to get the remove enough metal from the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.959 
to get the remove enough metal from the
edge<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.969> proper

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
edge to get down to the proper

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.510 
edge to get down to the proper
sharpening<00:01:00.300> angle<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> start

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
sharpening angle so we want to start

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.539
