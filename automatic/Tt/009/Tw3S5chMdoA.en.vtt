00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.920
 the world in recent years has had 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 a very fast change consumers 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.090
 today they decide to see these 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 trends we saw that it is super important 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 to continue building the brand in the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 mind of consumers migrate and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 give them what they want content 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 relevant if we add that the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.199
 poker values are closely linked to the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480
 friendship and humor makes perfect the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.640
 risk that we take with creating a one 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.640
 new web series called entrepans 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.760
 youtube allows us to reach our 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.620
 audience with infinite possibilities 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 as is entertainment 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.360
 information in this case we use humor 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.000
 be a millionaire that implies a great 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.070
 responsibility 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 you know what one does when a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.890
 millionaire class wrong 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.390
 between panels of a series of websites 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
 talk about popular situations 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.110
 Colombian that happens to a group of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.880
 friends that meets every Thursday in 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.309
 the house of one of them and start a 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.350
 diet to get the visa know someone 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.330
 by a social network that is the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 situations that happen to you that happen here 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 in Colombia and what happens to any 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 group of friends for us youtube is 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.220
 a fundamental ally in what we 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 we want to do and those contents that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.670
 we put there what they do is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.480
 sell experiences that are not always 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.730
 they have a friend a roe or the lazy 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.040
 the friend who holds arrest does not 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.159
 ident laughs and also poker 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 do you study or work 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.359
 and the different devices like 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 tablets or computers these are the 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.869
 Internet cafes make the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 Connectivity in Colombia is very high 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 Today we are walking because very well for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 the bus but there we took out the cell phone and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.689
 we want to watch a video on the networks 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.359
 social that takes us to youtube so 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.549
 Next year's trends of 85% 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.349
 of the content is going to be video then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.450
 a platform like youtube is 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.369
 supremely important to develop 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 the contents of any brand creates 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.880
 the great advantages that youtube grants 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.770
 besides being the second search engine 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 after google is that it allows us 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.019
 accurately measure the actual impact that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.610
 have these campaigns or this content 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.739
 how many people subscribed to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.540
 channel how many people saw it how many 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.940
 people got like how many people 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.290
 they shared the content and have those 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 data is fundamental for us 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.910
 because it allows us to measure success I think 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.890
 that in this campaign the most beautiful thing to see 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.629
 how people have more if they are going to take 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.549
 the second season but because just 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.079
 eight episodes but between the banner 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.819
 We are very happy because 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.489
 we could say that the content has 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.390
 approximately 8 million visits and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.400
 the channel now has 19 thousand 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.650
 flowers that can have access to this 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080
 content not only about the brand of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.690
 greater engagement in all colombia in the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.850
 last six months but at the level 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.590
 worldwide we are the brand of greatest ingame 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.000
 in the whole sabmiller group thanks to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.300
 youtube we can get there let's say with 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.220
 relatively smaller investment than in the 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.410
 traditional media and have a 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.310
 greater relevance in consumers who 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.310
 today they are there 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.950
 testing crowns
