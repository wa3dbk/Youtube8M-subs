of I think prevents me from trying
different<00:00:58.990> things<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.560> new<00:00:59.680> things<00:00:59.920> as<00:01:00.070> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
different things and new things as a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.530 
different things and new things as a
have<00:01:00.310> to<00:01:00.460> watch<00:01:00.640> them<00:01:00.790> style<00:01:01.060> it<00:01:01.180> every<00:01:01.390> day
