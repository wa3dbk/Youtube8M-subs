00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
seen a first-generation Sylvia the first

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.190 
seen a first-generation Sylvia the first
one<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.040> red<00:00:56.550> blob<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.240> a<00:00:57.330> car<00:00:57.570> sort<00:00:58.110> of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
one was a red blob of a car sort of

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.430 
one was a red blob of a car sort of
rough<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> rusty<00:00:59.780> which<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.900> got<00:01:01.050> I've<00:01:01.200> got<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
rough and rusty which I got I've got to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.570 
rough and rusty which I got I've got to
see<00:01:01.560> under<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.830> hood<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.220> one<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.550> that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
see under the hood of that one so that

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.660 
see under the hood of that one so that
was<00:01:02.820> great<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.450> was<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.980> 1600<00:01:04.980> CC<00:01:05.190> engine

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
was great and there was a 1600 CC engine

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.960 
was great and there was a 1600 CC engine
had<00:01:05.940> twin<00:01:06.240> su<00:01:06.900> carburetors<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.460> great<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
had twin su carburetors it was great to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.930 
had twin su carburetors it was great to
be<00:01:09.000> able<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.740> these<00:01:11.100> cars<00:01:11.490> were

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
be able to see that now these cars were

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.450 
be able to see that now these cars were
hand-built<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.050> hand<00:01:13.350> formed<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.280> guess

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
hand-built and hand formed and I guess

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
hand-built and hand formed and I guess
it's<00:01:14.610> sort<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.790> hard<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.120> convey<00:01:15.480> that<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's sort of hard to convey that to you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's sort of hard to convey that to you
but<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:17.159> experience<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.210> lifting

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but the experience that I had lifting

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
but the experience that I had lifting
the<00:01:18.930> hood<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> rough<00:01:19.800> one<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.490> weighed<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the hood of that rough one it weighed a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
the hood of that rough one it weighed a
ton<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.260> heavy<00:01:22.590> heavy<00:01:22.890> gauge

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
ton it was just so heavy heavy gauge

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.610 
ton it was just so heavy heavy gauge
steel<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.909> something<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:24.960> stuck<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
steel and something that really stuck in

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.280 
steel and something that really stuck in
my<00:01:25.650> mind<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.370> did<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.330> me<00:01:27.480> wonder<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
my mind I did just make me wonder how a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.590 
my mind I did just make me wonder how a
four-cylinder<00:01:29.250> engine<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.120> know<00:01:30.240> produced

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
four-cylinder engine you know produced

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.020 
four-cylinder engine you know produced
enough<00:01:30.810> power<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.260> propel<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.070> car<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
enough power to propel this car down the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.580 
enough power to propel this car down the
road<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.840> certainly<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> brakes

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
road and you know certainly the brakes

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
road and you know certainly the brakes
would<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> scratch

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
would have to be up to scratch

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.880 
would have to be up to scratch
to<00:01:36.120> stop<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.720> car<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.920> um<00:01:38.420> anyway

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
to stop this car the way that um anyway

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
to stop this car the way that um anyway
pretty<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.610> engineering<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
pretty cool engineering for back in the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
pretty cool engineering for back in the
day<00:01:42.799> now<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.830> think<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> platform<00:01:44.820> yeah<00:01:45.120> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
day now I think the platform yeah this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.820 
day now I think the platform yeah this
has<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:46.170> platform<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.640
