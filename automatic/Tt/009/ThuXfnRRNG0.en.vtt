00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
tubing will do that's what's going to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.970 
tubing will do that's what's going to
hinge<00:03:12.879> off<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.540> bike<00:03:14.160> solid<00:03:16.709> tube<00:03:17.709> right

here<00:03:18.660> they're<00:03:19.660> not<00:03:19.690> tube<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.950> whatever<00:03:21.730> shaft

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
here they're not tube but whatever shaft

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.229 
here they're not tube but whatever shaft
whatever<00:03:24.120> goes<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> square<00:03:27.819> tubing

whatever goes in to the square tubing

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.740 
whatever goes in to the square tubing
they're<00:03:30.359> one<00:03:31.359> bolt<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:32.790> for<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.269> probably

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
they're one bolt and for that I probably

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.099 
they're one bolt and for that I probably
I<00:03:35.849> would<00:03:36.849> say<00:03:37.590> your<00:03:38.590> softest<00:03:39.840> softest<00:03:40.840> bolt

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
I would say your softest softest bolt

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.520 
I would say your softest softest bolt
you<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.470> find<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:42.609> act<00:03:42.760> as<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> shear<00:03:43.299> pin<00:03:43.540> for

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
you can find to act as a shear pin for

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.940 
you can find to act as a shear pin for
this<00:03:44.739> rock<00:03:45.639> and<00:03:45.819> back<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:47.549> then<00:03:49.739> rocking<00:03:50.739> up

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
this rock and back and then rocking up

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.170 
this rock and back and then rocking up
from<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.849> pressure<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.239> your<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:54.340> strap

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
from the pressure of your your strap

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.270 
from the pressure of your your strap
that<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.660> put<00:03:55.870> on<00:03:56.049> but<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.889> bolt<00:03:57.160> right

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
that you can put on but this bolt right

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.610 
that you can put on but this bolt right
here<00:03:57.930> almost<00:03:58.930> could<00:03:59.200> even<00:03:59.380> be<00:04:00.959> some<00:04:01.959> wood<00:04:02.169> wood

here almost could even be some wood wood

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.520 
here almost could even be some wood wood
dowel<00:04:02.859> like<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.549> just<00:04:04.389> a<00:04:04.510> piece<00:04:04.780> because

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
dowel like that just a piece because

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.490 
dowel like that just a piece because
you'd<00:04:06.430> rather<00:04:06.639> have<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.209> brake<00:04:07.989> on<00:04:08.260> you

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
you'd rather have that brake on you

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.270 
you'd rather have that brake on you
every<00:04:09.310> ten<00:04:10.000> times<00:04:10.359> going<00:04:10.750> out<00:04:10.900> then<00:04:11.829> have<00:04:12.069> your

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
every ten times going out then have your

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.360 
every ten times going out then have your
motor<00:04:12.489> crack<00:04:12.819> part<00:04:13.560> let's<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.739> connect<00:04:15.069> as<00:04:15.340> a

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
motor crack part let's just connect as a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.969 
motor crack part let's just connect as a
shear<00:04:15.669> pin<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:18.400> can<00:04:18.549> find<00:04:18.820> something<00:04:19.979> softer

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
shear pin you can find something softer

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.320 
shear pin you can find something softer
or<00:04:21.390> whatever<00:04:22.390> then<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.469> aluminum<00:04:23.680> or<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:25.180> a

piece of
 aluminum<00:04:26.880> even<00:04:27.060> that's<00:04:27.960> going<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.230> be

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
 aluminum even that's going to be

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.120 
 aluminum even that's going to be
softer<00:04:28.830> than<00:04:29.510> then<00:04:30.620> what<00:04:31.620> your<00:04:31.770> motor<00:04:31.980> is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
softer than then what your motor is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:43.430 
softer than then what your motor is

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
built just like this and then if you can

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.600 
built just like this and then if you can
find<00:05:19.440> something<00:05:19.650> with<00:05:19.800> threaded<00:05:20.250> all<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.490> way

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
find something with threaded all the way

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.850 
find something with threaded all the way
and<00:05:21.600> you're<00:05:21.690> good<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.110> then<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.380> can<00:05:22.530> cut<00:05:22.740> it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
and you're good and then you can cut it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.090 
and you're good and then you can cut it
out<00:05:22.950> with<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.190> hacksaw<00:05:23.700> I<00:05:24.660> put<00:05:25.470> my<00:05:25.650> bolts<00:05:25.980> in

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
out with the hacksaw I put my bolts in

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.390 
out with the hacksaw I put my bolts in
this<00:05:26.310> way<00:05:26.520> if<00:05:27.450> you<00:05:27.870> got<00:05:28.020> long<00:05:28.230> times<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:29.100> put

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
this way if you got long times just put

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.900 
this way if you got long times just put
in<00:05:29.580> long<00:05:30.420> ways<00:05:30.690> cut<00:05:31.200> them<00:05:31.320> off<00:05:31.380> flush<00:05:31.820> with<00:05:32.820> the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
in long ways cut them off flush with the

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:40.020 
in long ways cut them off flush with the
case<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.330> hose<00:05:33.480> in<00:05:33.720> there

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.720 

for<00:05:40.660> for<00:05:41.500> mounting<00:05:41.860> wise<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.100> think<00:05:42.520> that

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
for for mounting wise I think that

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.540 
for for mounting wise I think that
should<00:05:42.970> be<00:05:43.030> be<00:05:43.990> pretty<00:05:44.290> wallet<00:05:44.710> it's<00:05:45.250> just<00:05:45.430> a

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
should be be pretty wallet it's just a

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.900 
should be be pretty wallet it's just a
few<00:05:45.760> pieces<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.290> main<00:05:47.440> idea<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:50.910> to

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
few pieces the the main idea is to to

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.870 
few pieces the the main idea is to to
hinge<00:05:52.870> off<00:05:53.110> your<00:05:53.260> bike<00:05:53.470> with<00:05:54.160> a<00:05:54.190> tube<00:05:54.520> there

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
hinge off your bike with a tube there

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.960 
hinge off your bike with a tube there
and<00:05:55.980> I<00:05:57.330> guess<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.900> next<00:05:59.800> next<00:06:00.430> vids<00:06:00.640> there

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
and I guess the the next next vids there

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.560 
and I guess the the next next vids there
we<00:06:01.780> make<00:06:02.020> here<00:06:02.290> will<00:06:02.560> be<00:06:03.060> how<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.090> mount<00:06:04.420> it

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
we make here will be how to mount it

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.430 
we make here will be how to mount it
onto<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.960> bike<00:06:08.940> right<00:06:09.940> I've<00:06:10.750> been<00:06:10.930> pretty

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
onto the bike right I've been pretty

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.960 
onto the bike right I've been pretty
slow<00:06:11.620> I've<00:06:11.920> been<00:06:12.100> pretty<00:06:12.310> busy<00:06:12.400> in<00:06:12.700> life

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
slow I've been pretty busy in life

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.720 
slow I've been pretty busy in life
lately<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.780> a<00:06:14.020> lot<00:06:14.740> of<00:06:14.770> back<00:06:14.980> problems<00:06:15.490> that

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
lately and a lot of back problems that

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.360 
lately and a lot of back problems that
guy<00:06:15.940> thing<00:06:16.500> so<00:06:17.500> it's<00:06:17.680> been<00:06:17.830> hard<00:06:18.040> to<00:06:18.130> get<00:06:18.220> out
