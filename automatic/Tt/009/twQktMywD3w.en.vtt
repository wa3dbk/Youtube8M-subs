order<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> conserve<00:00:38.160> battery<00:00:38.370> life<00:00:38.579> which<00:00:38.850> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
order to conserve battery life which is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.979 
order to conserve battery life which is
great<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.570> always<00:00:39.750> been<00:00:39.930> an

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
great because that's always been an

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
great because that's always been an
issue<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.500> past<00:00:41.100> battery<00:00:41.430> packs<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:41.820> just

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
issue with past battery packs they just

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
issue with past battery packs they just
continue<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> gouge<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.750> power<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
continue to gouge out power and you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.930 
continue to gouge out power and you
don't<00:00:43.860> even<00:00:44.160> know<00:00:44.250> how<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.760> left

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
don't even know how much you have left

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
don't even know how much you have left
by<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> time<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.570> looking<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.320> your

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
by the time you're looking at your

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
by the time you're looking at your
battery<00:00:46.710> meter<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.520> overall<00:00:47.760> we're<00:00:47.879> gonna

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
battery meter so overall we're gonna

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160 
battery meter so overall we're gonna
take<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> look<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.960> looks<00:00:49.110> on

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
take a look at it see how it looks on

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709 
take a look at it see how it looks on
the<00:00:49.260> iPhone<00:00:49.559> 6<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> whether<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the iPhone 6 and whether or not it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
the iPhone 6 and whether or not it's
definitely<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.320> great<00:00:52.590> alternative<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
definitely a great alternative to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.240 
definitely a great alternative to
battery<00:00:54.120> power<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.989> iPhone<00:00:55.829> 6<00:01:01.250> starting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
battery power on your iPhone 6 starting

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.579 
battery power on your iPhone 6 starting
off<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> actual<00:01:03.059> sliding<00:01:03.570> case<00:01:03.870> we're

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
off with the actual sliding case we're

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
off with the actual sliding case we're
going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> put<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> iPhone<00:01:05.309> 6<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
going to put it on the iPhone 6 here and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.870 
going to put it on the iPhone 6 here and
see<00:01:06.299> how<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> fits<00:01:07.040> now<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> iPhone<00:01:08.369> 6<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
see how well it fits now the iPhone 6 is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
see how well it fits now the iPhone 6 is
a<00:01:08.939> very<00:01:09.119> slim<00:01:09.360> device<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> hopefully<00:01:10.860> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
a very slim device and hopefully it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
a very slim device and hopefully it
keeps<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.490> mantra<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> case<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
keeps that mantra here with the case and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.289 
keeps that mantra here with the case and
from<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.740> impressions<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> definitely<00:01:14.939> has

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
from first impressions it definitely has

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
from first impressions it definitely has
been<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> regard<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.369> see

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
been great in that regard as you can see

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.020 
been great in that regard as you can see
here<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.570> rather<00:01:18.780> thin<00:01:19.340> very<00:01:20.340> nice<00:01:20.580> profile

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
here it is rather thin very nice profile

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.660 
here it is rather thin very nice profile
almost<00:01:21.479> reminiscent<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> iPhone<00:01:22.619> 5<00:01:23.340> body

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
almost reminiscent of the iPhone 5 body

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.859 
almost reminiscent of the iPhone 5 body
because<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> gives<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.720> more

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
because it gives you a little bit more

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
because it gives you a little bit more
rounded<00:01:24.990> corners<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.650> edges<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
rounded corners and edges there which is

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
rounded corners and edges there which is
very<00:01:26.909> nice<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.630> has<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.900> nice<00:01:28.320> soft<00:01:28.619> matte

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
very nice but has a very nice soft matte

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
very nice but has a very nice soft matte
finish<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.600> does

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
finish now as you can see there it does

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.200 
finish now as you can see there it does
gain<00:01:30.990> fingerprints<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> smudges<00:01:32.549> quite<00:01:32.970> well

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
gain fingerprints and smudges quite well

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
gain fingerprints and smudges quite well
but<00:01:33.479> over<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:33.990> using<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> I've<00:01:34.590> actually

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
but over my time using it I've actually

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340 
but over my time using it I've actually
used<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.299> secondary<00:01:36.299> case<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> main<00:01:37.110> case

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
used the secondary case as a main case

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.950 
used the secondary case as a main case
in<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.329> easier<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> install

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
in my use just so it's easier to install

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
in my use just so it's easier to install
because<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.040> wanna<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> always

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
because you just wanna have to always

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
because you just wanna have to always
change<00:01:41.939> cases<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
change cases and put them back on just

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
change cases and put them back on just
to<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.829> our<00:01:43.979> battery<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.759> general<00:01:45.540> I've

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
to have our battery but in general I've

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.289 
to have our battery but in general I've
enjoyed<00:01:46.380> using<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> tilt<00:01:47.189> case<00:01:47.430> in

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
enjoyed using the tilt case in

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.940 
enjoyed using the tilt case in
correlation<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.170> actual<00:01:49.409> battery<00:01:49.590> pack

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
correlation with the actual battery pack

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
correlation with the actual battery pack
using<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.880> dual<00:01:51.270> step<00:01:51.659> process<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.470> really

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
using the dual step process is really

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
using the dual step process is really
quite<00:01:52.920> simple<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:54.149> case<00:01:54.600> itself<00:01:55.049> has

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
quite simple the case itself has

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.520 
quite simple the case itself has
registered<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.950> coincide<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.850> ridges

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
registered that coincide with the ridges

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
registered that coincide with the ridges
inside<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.890> case<00:01:59.310> itself<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.630> have

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
inside the case itself so all you have

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
inside the case itself so all you have
to<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.259> line<00:02:01.439> them<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.880> we're

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to do is line them up and what we're

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.100 
to do is line them up and what we're
going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.600> show<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
going to do here is show you how that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.160 
going to do here is show you how that
works<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.969> satisfying<00:02:06.659> almost

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
works and you know satisfying almost

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
works and you know satisfying almost
clicking<00:02:07.530> feeling<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.670> sound<00:02:08.910> once<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> do

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
clicking feeling and sound once you do

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
clicking feeling and sound once you do
that<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.989> firmly<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:11.099> there<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that and it's firmly in there and as you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.930 
that and it's firmly in there and as you
can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.030> does<00:02:12.209> add<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
can see it does add a bit of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.510 
can see it does add a bit of
but<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> back<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.140> kind<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.440> rounded<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.010> it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
but the back is kind of rounded and it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.000 
but the back is kind of rounded and it
uses<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.820> same<00:02:16.030> material<00:02:16.600> as<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.710> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
uses the same material as the the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.620 
uses the same material as the the
secondary<00:02:18.400> case<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.880> showed<00:02:19.030> earlier<00:02:19.360> so

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
secondary case that I showed earlier so

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.800 
secondary case that I showed earlier so
it<00:02:20.020> feels<00:02:20.620> good<00:02:20.890> for<00:02:21.190> some<00:02:21.730> reason<00:02:22.120> overtimes

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
it feels good for some reason overtimes

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.200 
it feels good for some reason overtimes
gotten<00:02:23.170> quite<00:02:23.410> slippery<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.880> doesn't

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
gotten quite slippery and it doesn't

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.460 
gotten quite slippery and it doesn't
attract<00:02:25.890> smudges<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:28.330> imprints<00:02:29.320> as

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
attract smudges and and imprints as

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.770 
attract smudges and and imprints as
easily<00:02:29.740> as<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> secondary<00:02:30.490> case<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.630> does

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
easily as a secondary case but it does

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.210 
easily as a secondary case but it does
do<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.350> I'll<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.650> wearing<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.100> as

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
do that so I'll just be wearing that as

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.550 
do that so I'll just be wearing that as
well<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.600> sufficient<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.260> mean<00:02:35.440> it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
well but it is sufficient I mean it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.410 
well but it is sufficient I mean it
feels<00:02:35.680> compact<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> hand<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.060> have

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
feels compact in the hand I really have

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.170 
feels compact in the hand I really have
no<00:02:37.660> complaints<00:02:37.870> about<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.430> look<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.030> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
no complaints about the look of it I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.910 
no complaints about the look of it I
mean<00:02:40.300> for<00:02:40.840> some<00:02:41.020> people<00:02:41.050> thought<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.770> was<00:02:41.890> a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
mean for some people thought this was a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.290 
mean for some people thought this was a
kickstand<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.640> might<00:02:42.760> be<00:02:42.910> something<00:02:43.120> that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
kickstand and it might be something that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.330 
kickstand and it might be something that
felt<00:02:43.510> might<00:02:43.690> want<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.900> look<00:02:44.020> towards<00:02:45.010> Doolin

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
felt might want to look towards Doolin

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.620 
felt might want to look towards Doolin
later<00:02:45.490> in<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.730> future<00:02:45.910> kind<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.300> help<00:02:46.510> with

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
later in the future kind of help with

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.570 
later in the future kind of help with
multimedia<00:02:46.960> since<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> battery<00:02:48.280> pack

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
multimedia since it is a battery pack

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.970 
multimedia since it is a battery pack
and<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.880> would<00:02:49.000> also<00:02:49.120> make<00:02:50.050> sense<00:02:50.320> but<00:02:50.710> in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and that would also make sense but in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.800 
and that would also make sense but in
general<00:02:51.580> definitely<00:02:52.120> great<00:02:52.240> design<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
general definitely great design as you

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.690 
general definitely great design as you
can<00:02:52.960> see<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.830> back<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.490> do<00:02:54.670> have

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
can see on the back there you do have

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.780 
can see on the back there you do have
your<00:02:55.120> power<00:02:55.390> button<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.460> now<00:02:57.670> this

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
your power button and like so now this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.370 
your power button and like so now this
isn't<00:02:58.000> charged<00:02:58.360> up<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:58.810> that's<00:02:59.050> pretty<00:02:59.290> much

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
isn't charged up but that's pretty much

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.290 
isn't charged up but that's pretty much
how<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.590> process<00:02:59.950> goes<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.820> charge<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.210> up

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
how the process goes you charge it up

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.180 
how the process goes you charge it up
and<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.170> switch<00:03:02.410> up<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.950> can<00:03:03.070> see

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and if you switch up there you can see

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.360 
and if you switch up there you can see
that<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> iPhone<00:03:03.790> 6<00:03:04.210> is<00:03:04.420> now<00:03:04.990> charging<00:03:05.650> now

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that the iPhone 6 is now charging now

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.560 
that the iPhone 6 is now charging now
one<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.700> great<00:03:06.820> features<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.120> mentioned

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
one of the great features that mentioned

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.270 
one of the great features that mentioned
earlier<00:03:07.840> about<00:03:08.020> this<00:03:08.440> case<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> fact<00:03:09.190> that

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
earlier about this case is the fact that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.820 
earlier about this case is the fact that
most<00:03:09.880> regions<00:03:10.210> 100%<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.020> phone<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.440> just

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
most regions 100% on the phone it just

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.830 
most regions 100% on the phone it just
cuts<00:03:12.040> off<00:03:12.190> power<00:03:12.370> completely<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.600> just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
cuts off power completely so just

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.750 
cuts off power completely so just

milliamps<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:50.740> with<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.490> being<00:03:51.730> said<00:03:51.820> it's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
milliamps so with that being said it's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.110 
milliamps so with that being said it's
pretty<00:03:52.600> much<00:03:52.750> about<00:03:53.280> almost<00:03:54.280> two<00:03:54.520> charges<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
pretty much about almost two charges and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.280 
pretty much about almost two charges and
actually<00:03:55.450> like<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.630> charge<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.110> half

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
actually like a charge and a half

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.890 
actually like a charge and a half
because<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.740> iPhone<00:03:56.860> 6<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.370> 18<00:03:57.580> 10<00:03:58.000> milliamps

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
because the iPhone 6 is 18 10 milliamps

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.850 
because the iPhone 6 is 18 10 milliamps
which<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.860> okay<00:04:00.130> I'm<00:04:01.060> ok<00:04:01.330> with<00:04:01.360> that
