00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.250 
different types of dynamic plane whether
you're<00:00:39.879> a<00:00:39.910> rock<00:00:40.150> piano<00:00:40.510> player<00:00:40.780> or<00:00:40.989> a

you're a rock piano player or a
classically<00:00:41.830> trained<00:00:42.070> pianist<00:00:42.519> you<00:00:43.030> have

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
classically trained pianist you have

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.390 
classically trained pianist you have
this<00:00:43.660> actually<00:00:44.170> can<00:00:44.290> handle<00:00:44.620> everything<00:00:44.890> okay

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
this actually can handle everything okay

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.920 
this actually can handle everything okay
also<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.180> has<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.390> new<00:00:48.300> high<00:00:49.300> resolution

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
also it has a new high resolution

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.950 
also it has a new high resolution
medieval<00:00:50.800> assa<00:00:50.949> T<00:00:51.159> out<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:51.670> you're<00:00:51.850> it<00:00:52.059> records

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
medieval assa T out so you're it records

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.079 
medieval assa T out so you're it records
your<00:00:53.019> performances<00:00:53.769> 100<00:00:54.729> times<00:00:54.970> more

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
your performances 100 times more

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.660 
your performances 100 times more
accurate<00:00:55.659> than<00:00:55.750> before<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.860> that's<00:00:57.250> really

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
accurate than before so that's really

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.479 
accurate than before so that's really
really<00:00:57.850> cool<00:00:58.409> also<00:00:59.409> it<00:00:59.530> has<00:00:59.739> everything<00:01:00.100> real

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
really cool also it has everything real

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.719 
really cool also it has everything real
time<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:00.909> the<00:01:01.000> front<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.479> have<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.949> EQ

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
time on the front so you have the EQ

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.570 
time on the front so you have the EQ
delay<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.330> for<00:01:04.900> new<00:01:05.110> assignable<00:01:05.680> knobs<00:01:05.950> we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
delay and for new assignable knobs we

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670 
delay and for new assignable knobs we
also<00:01:06.729> have<00:01:07.060> tremolo<00:01:07.570> amp<00:01:07.810> simulation<00:01:08.320> and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
also have tremolo amp simulation and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.070 
also have tremolo amp simulation and
modulation<00:01:09.310> effects<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.299> can<00:01:10.630> adjust

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
modulation effects that you can adjust

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.420 
modulation effects that you can adjust
but<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.680> main<00:01:11.830> thing<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.040> we're<00:01:12.250> talking

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
but the main thing that we're talking

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.789 
but the main thing that we're talking
about<00:01:12.729> here<00:01:12.880> with<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.420> RT<00:01:13.720> is<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.930> tone<00:01:14.440> color

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
about here with the RT is the tone color

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.330 
about here with the RT is the tone color
and<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.580> allows<00:01:15.940> us<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.570> be<00:01:17.110> able<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.560> switch

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
and that allows us to be able to switch

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.429 
and that allows us to be able to switch
from<00:01:18.729> say<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.780> mono<00:01:20.880> upright<00:01:21.880> piano<00:01:22.240> with<00:01:23.170> one

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
from say a mono upright piano with one

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.319 
from say a mono upright piano with one
turn<00:01:23.649> oven<00:01:23.829> off<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.219> turns<00:01:24.430> into<00:01:24.609> a<00:01:24.820> huge

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
turn oven off it turns into a huge

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.920 
turn oven off it turns into a huge
concert<00:01:26.170> grand<00:01:26.890> stereo<00:01:27.579> wide<00:01:27.939> pan<00:01:28.359> stereo

sudden the sound opens up real wide if I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
sudden the sound opens up real wide if I
was<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> take<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:54.000> organ<00:01:54.390> sound<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.649> does

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.160 
that it's as if somebody's grabbing the
drawbars<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.679> bunch<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.429> them<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.929> if<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
drawbars a bunch of them and then if I

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
drawbars a bunch of them and then if I
turn<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:07.799> all<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.880> I'd<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.509> cranks

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
turn it all the way then I'd also cranks

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.240 
turn it all the way then I'd also cranks
in<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> rotary<00:02:11.039> effect<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
in the rotary effect so it's a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.650 
in the rotary effect so it's a
characteristic<00:02:14.250> change<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.269> one<00:02:15.420> turn

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
characteristic change with just one turn

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
characteristic change with just one turn
