pain<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.060> my<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> area<00:00:31.740> over

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
pain in my right here in this area over

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.330 
pain in my right here in this area over
here<00:00:32.189> especially<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> left<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
here especially the one on the left and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.889 
here especially the one on the left and
it's<00:00:35.340> been<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> long<00:00:36.360> time

it's been going on for a long time

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.580 
it's been going on for a long time
partially<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
partially I think it's because I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.840 
partially I think it's because I
breakfast<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> lot<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:41.670> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
breakfast a lot and I think that's just

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
okay what between the duty is reduced to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.800 
okay what between the duty is reduced to
stress<00:04:13.850> on<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> muscles<00:04:14.330> reduce

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
stress on the muscles reduce

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.310 
stress on the muscles reduce
inflammation<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.280> things<00:04:16.519> like<00:04:16.840> maybe<00:04:17.840> jello

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
inflammation so things like maybe jello

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.890 
inflammation so things like maybe jello
