00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi all dance if I hope you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.259
 wears very well and will launch three 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.240
 new videos 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.269
 while today I could I you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 did not propose but rather a tutorial 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.670
 basically mac players who 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 play as a team so I 'm going to enter 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.470
 that's the sign I made on the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.050
 epic server the beta for now and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.210
 I will explain how to optimize 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.590
 optimize the game in sum ie 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.349
 for example you have to move everything 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 that it delays some of the times they 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 click on the floor and on the icons at 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 Gabon you can not see them but and click 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.570
 on the icons in babouches all that but 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 I think it's pretty slow so I 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 you will prove a way to be able to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.340
 switcher like that in a just fair shot 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.879
 by pressing on the arrows on 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.590
 your keyboard 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.629
 for example, you want to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 move you asked too lazy 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.270
 move your cursor we recognize that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 happens often when 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.510
 for those who do not know who do not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.949
 the same as me I'm just going to 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.120
 press press the arrow to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:09.119
 change to support it to support for 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.130
 press raffier pressed down 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.810
 good is to do that by a little bit of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.590
 lag yeah yeah finally you understood 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.060
 the system like that all your sim is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 move you can come back with 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.229
 main character while we 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 explains how we do that then everything 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.159
 first crafted to look on your 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.590
 keyboard you will have some kind of touch 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.840
 for me it's the key f3 is key 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.280
 you will see there are several squares like 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 multiple windows then you click 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.070
 on top you will see that here you and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 your office in office 2 of ropraz bla 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 blah actually you have to create plans 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.159
 Child day accounts you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 protect yourself for example from 4 years you 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.310
 help four offices 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.890
 how to find an office then you 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 go deep down so do not mind if I 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.390
 click exit if they want to open a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.850
 office what will do is more than we 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.670
 in fact we small how to build 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.610
 then you will open the preferences 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 system with new shapes and click 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.500
 on mission control 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 that's what helps manage 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 to manage all that and you go all 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.550
 first disable his rearranged 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.770
 automatically spaces based 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.390
 of your interesting use 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 why disable it just because 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.520
 that usually we go configure 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.630
 your offices according to the initiative 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.000
 of your characters 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.680
 I just want to clarify that at the level 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.930
 offices are not obliged to do 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.150
 initiative words it's not you 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.030
 can switch all this finally consciousness 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.080
 from the character initiative 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.270
 so if a character takes for example 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.560
 the beautiful rain initiative you break 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.180
 not head to start all over again 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.550
 change just shut up in front of you 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.310
 behind you see delirium like spa 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.989
 will be difficult to remove it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.510
 because otherwise it's going to change to 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.730
 every time for example business 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.630
 very last two characters like 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.640
 this is the last one you will use 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 you want to come back for your first 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:08.780
 character it's going right next it's going to be 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.180
 what he is what I recommend to you 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.010
 also it's that in your icons that are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.440
 down well bah you see them not but not 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.989
 possible they are down go 8 icon of 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.820
 could for example when I played in and 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.700
 if what I recommend you do them 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.470
 order in order of initiative also do not 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 he was not worried about moving them if 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.230
 it 's not bad I recommend you 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.640
 that because we need, for example, you need 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.120
 for example are on your last 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.500

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.160
 some but after I finally saw 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.950

 how does it live stars have the same way 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.330
 that I use and went for more practice 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.350
 even the two of the fights you launch a 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.360
 fight 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.810
 listen without reselling the change and the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.190

 Local more enticing than it is better 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.250
