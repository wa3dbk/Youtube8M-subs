who aren't billionaires it actually

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560 
who aren't billionaires it actually
affects<00:00:29.619> all<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.250> society<00:00:30.730> when<00:00:30.880> such<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.119> huge

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
affects all of society when such a huge

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.030 
affects all of society when such a huge
amount<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:31.900> money<00:00:32.019> is<00:00:32.169> kept<00:00:32.410> in<00:00:32.529> cash<00:00:32.710> well

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
amount of money is kept in cash well

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.799 
amount of money is kept in cash well
what<00:00:33.700> does<00:00:33.760> it<00:00:33.880> mean<00:00:34.059> well<00:00:34.360> on<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.600> most<00:00:34.750> basic

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
what does it mean well on the most basic

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.720 
what does it mean well on the most basic
level<00:00:35.260> it<00:00:35.739> seems<00:00:36.040> that<00:00:36.160> when<00:00:36.309> people<00:00:36.430> hold

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
level it seems that when people hold

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.030 
level it seems that when people hold
money<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.390> cash<00:00:37.960> as<00:00:38.230> opposed<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.590> putting<00:00:38.890> it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
money in cash as opposed to putting it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.310 
money in cash as opposed to putting it
into<00:00:39.160> markets<00:00:39.550> into<00:00:39.760> investments<00:00:40.270> etc<00:00:40.360> they

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
into markets into investments etc they

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.500 
into markets into investments etc they
might<00:00:41.530> be<00:00:41.649> afraid<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.160> something<00:00:42.460> yeah<00:00:43.090> it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
might be afraid of something yeah it's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.880 
might be afraid of something yeah it's
either<00:00:43.629> fear<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.350> markets<00:00:44.710> aren't

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
either fear that the markets aren't

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.950 
either fear that the markets aren't
projected<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.820> do<00:00:46.000> well<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.420> they're<00:00:46.570> afraid

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
projected to do well and they're afraid

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.540 
projected to do well and they're afraid
of<00:00:47.050> losing<00:00:47.350> their<00:00:47.469> money<00:00:47.590> in<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.770> market<00:00:47.950> or

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
of losing their money in the market or

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.950 
of losing their money in the market or
perhaps<00:00:48.730> even<00:00:49.090> if<00:00:49.420> they<00:00:49.629> decide<00:00:49.930> to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
perhaps even if they decide to

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.180 
perhaps even if they decide to
participate<00:00:50.200> in<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.590> market<00:00:50.860> they're<00:00:50.980> afraid

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
participate in the market they're afraid

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.319 
participate in the market they're afraid
that<00:00:51.280> they<00:00:51.520> might<00:00:51.550> not<00:00:51.879> know<00:00:52.059> how<00:00:52.300> to

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
that they might not know how to

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.970 
that they might not know how to
participate<00:00:52.809> in<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.230> right<00:00:53.379> though<00:00:53.530> oh<00:00:53.680> shoot

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
participate in it right though oh shoot

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.290 
participate in it right though oh shoot
I<00:00:54.070> don't<00:00:54.219> know<00:00:54.280> how<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.460> invest<00:00:54.699> it<00:00:54.879> emits<00:00:55.210> it

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
I don't know how to invest it emits it

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.910 
I don't know how to invest it emits it
here<00:00:55.510> or<00:00:55.539> there<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.350> there's<00:00:56.500> always<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.710> risk

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
here or there so there's always a risk

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.590 
here or there so there's always a risk
associated<00:00:57.309> with<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.789> but<00:00:57.969> I<00:00:58.149> think<00:00:58.329> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
associated with that but I think the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.180 
associated with that but I think the
issue<00:00:58.719> here<00:00:58.960> goes<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.199> lot<00:00:59.500> deeper<00:00:59.559> than<00:00:59.980> just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
issue here goes a lot deeper than just

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.459 
issue here goes a lot deeper than just
the<00:01:00.460> obvious<00:01:00.789> fear<00:01:01.629> deeper<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.170> it's<00:01:02.289> not<00:01:02.410> just

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
the obvious fear deeper so it's not just

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.320 
the obvious fear deeper so it's not just
oh<00:01:02.829> I<00:01:03.010> don't<00:01:03.160> think<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.370> markets<00:01:03.640> are<00:01:03.730> good<00:01:03.910> /

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
oh I don't think the markets are good /

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.030 
oh I don't think the markets are good /
I'm<00:01:04.689> afraid<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.080> lose<00:01:05.199> all<00:01:05.350> my<00:01:05.439> money<00:01:05.470> or

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
I'm afraid to lose all my money or

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.320 
I'm afraid to lose all my money or
something<00:01:06.220> like<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.520> it<00:01:07.119> might<00:01:07.270> be

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
something like that it might be

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.520 
something like that it might be
something<00:01:07.479> else<00:01:07.630> well<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.020> understand

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
something else well to understand

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.140 
something else well to understand
exactly<00:01:08.680> who<00:01:09.070> these<00:01:09.220> billionaires<00:01:09.700> are<00:01:09.880> let's

exactly who these billionaires are let's

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.940 
exactly who these billionaires are let's
take<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.330> look<00:01:10.570> at<00:01:10.990> this<00:01:11.170> chart<00:01:11.380> check<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.860> out

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
take a look at this chart check it out

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.520 
take a look at this chart check it out
the<00:01:12.520> distribution<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.510> billionaires<00:01:14.080> by<00:01:14.260> age

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the distribution of billionaires by age

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530 
the distribution of billionaires by age
shows<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.340> most<00:01:15.549> of<00:01:15.820> them<00:01:15.939> are<00:01:16.180> clumped

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
shows that most of them are clumped

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.890 
shows that most of them are clumped
between<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:17.049> ages<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.350> 45<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.310> 74<00:01:19.090> now<00:01:19.659> that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
between the ages of 45 and 74 now that

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.390 
between the ages of 45 and 74 now that
is<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.049> big<00:01:20.439> distribution<00:01:21.009> but<00:01:21.159> it<00:01:21.280> basically

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
is a big distribution but it basically

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.429 
is a big distribution but it basically
means<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.030> most<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.810> them<00:01:22.930> just<00:01:23.229> went

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
means that most of them just went

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.810 
means that most of them just went
through<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.710> last<00:01:23.890> financial<00:01:24.250> crisis

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820

Lysette right as they are preparing to
head<00:01:28.060> into<00:01:28.270> retirement<00:01:28.659> age<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.350> think<00:01:29.829> there's

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
head into retirement age I think there's

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.219 
head into retirement age I think there's
a<00:01:30.100> collective<00:01:30.579> memory<00:01:31.000> among<00:01:31.780> billionaires

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
a collective memory among billionaires

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.350 
a collective memory among billionaires
that<00:01:32.560> sticks<00:01:33.280> around<00:01:33.430> after<00:01:34.030> something<00:01:34.210> like

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
that sticks around after something like

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.240 
that sticks around after something like
that<00:01:34.659> where<00:01:34.840> they're<00:01:34.930> like<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.259> lost<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.920> huge

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
that where they're like I lost a huge

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.039 
that where they're like I lost a huge
amount<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.640> money<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:37.210> don't<00:01:37.689> know<00:01:37.780> when<00:01:37.930> that

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
amount of money I don't know when that

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.450 
amount of money I don't know when that
could<00:01:38.200> happen<00:01:38.320> again<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.799> really<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.280> didn't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
could happen again it really we didn't

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.649 
could happen again it really we didn't
see<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> last<00:01:39.700> one<00:01:39.939> coming<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.479> could

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
see the last one coming this could

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.480 
see the last one coming this could
happen<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.259> me<00:01:41.380> again<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.710> my<00:01:41.829> lifetime<00:01:42.040> I

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
happen to me again in my lifetime I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.950 
happen to me again in my lifetime I
think<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:42.939> gonna<00:01:43.030> keep<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.450> cash<00:01:43.600> yeah

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
think it's gonna keep it in cash yeah

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.850 
think it's gonna keep it in cash yeah
now<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.229> course<00:01:44.259> we're<00:01:44.560> not<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.770> talking

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
now of course we're not just talking

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.289 
now of course we're not just talking
about<00:01:45.070> keeping<00:01:45.579> it<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:45.759> cash<00:01:45.909> under<00:01:46.180> your

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
about keeping it in cash under your

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.940 
about keeping it in cash under your
mattress<00:01:46.509> billionaires<00:01:47.470> don't<00:01:47.649> do<00:01:47.770> that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
mattress billionaires don't do that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.350 
mattress billionaires don't do that
first<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.549> all<00:01:48.610> they<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:48.820> many<00:01:48.970> mattresses

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
first of all they have many mattresses

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600 
first of all they have many mattresses
so<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.720> would<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.840> very<00:01:50.619> inconvenient<00:01:51.040> but

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
so that would be very inconvenient but

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.710 
so that would be very inconvenient but
more<00:01:51.909> importantly<00:01:52.270> they're<00:01:52.450> keeping<00:01:52.689> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
more importantly they're keeping it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.450 
more importantly they're keeping it
probably<00:01:53.049> in<00:01:53.140> cash<00:01:53.290> Akash<00:01:53.560> equivalents<00:01:54.159> money

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
probably in cash Akash equivalents money

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.889 
probably in cash Akash equivalents money
market<00:01:54.670> accounts<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.149> sort<00:01:55.329> of<00:01:55.360> thing<00:01:55.450> so

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
market accounts that sort of thing so

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.270 
market accounts that sort of thing so
it's<00:01:56.049> working<00:01:56.320> but<00:01:56.619> it's<00:01:56.770> not<00:01:56.890> working<00:01:57.040> as

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
it's working but it's not working as

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.039 
it's working but it's not working as
hard<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:58.119> important<00:01:58.479> thing<00:01:58.540> about<00:01:58.689> this

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
hard the important thing about this

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.330 
hard the important thing about this
though<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.439> that<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.829> really<00:02:00.009> does<00:02:00.219> affect

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
though is that it really does affect

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.090 
though is that it really does affect

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
be pretty standard across economic

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.289 
be pretty standard across economic

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
classes of investors so so it's not like

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.009 
classes of investors so so it's not like
billionaires<00:02:39.700> are<00:02:39.879> specifically<00:02:40.569> saying<00:02:40.900> I'm

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
gonna hoard all my money although it

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.160 
gonna hoard all my money although it
does<00:02:42.610> seem<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.819> be<00:02:42.910> ticking<00:02:43.599> up<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.019> bit

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
does seem to be ticking up a little bit

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.839 
does seem to be ticking up a little bit
in<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.319> last<00:02:44.379> year<00:02:44.799> which<00:02:44.980> should<00:02:45.579> give<00:02:45.730> us

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
in the last year which should give us

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.330 
in the last year which should give us
pause<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.019> pretty<00:02:47.410> pretty<00:02:47.890> standard

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
pause but this is pretty pretty standard

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.130 
pause but this is pretty pretty standard
what's<00:02:48.549> more<00:02:48.790> disturbing<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:49.840> point<00:02:49.959> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
what's more disturbing to your point is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.690 
what's more disturbing to your point is

it's<00:03:07.360> very<00:03:07.599> easy<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.810> look<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:08.049> this<00:03:08.140> and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
it's very easy to look at this and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.630 
it's very easy to look at this and
