be back home again up there in New York
which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.250> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
which is that the way it is but I just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
which is that the way it is but I just
been<00:01:41.909> real<00:01:42.090> proud<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.540> he's<00:01:42.689> handled

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
been real proud of the way he's handled

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.260 
been real proud of the way he's handled
it<00:01:43.170> he's<00:01:43.290> never<00:01:43.560> claimed<00:01:44.369> anyone<00:01:44.820> else<00:01:45.060> he's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it he's never claimed anyone else he's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
it he's never claimed anyone else he's
always<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.840> started<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.290> himself<00:01:46.439> and

always kind of started with himself and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.289 
always kind of started with himself and
I<00:01:47.220> think<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> handle

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.560 
I think that's the right way to handle
it<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> he<00:01:49.740> any<00:01:50.009> less<00:01:50.399> deferential<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.420> his

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it is he any less deferential to his

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.620 
it is he any less deferential to his
