I'd<00:00:06.089> like<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.390> show<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.839> little<00:00:07.020> bit<00:00:07.140> of

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
I'd like to show you a little bit of

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.640 
I'd like to show you a little bit of
what<00:00:08.309> we're<00:00:08.490> doing<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.849> year<00:00:09.139> we<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.320> start

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
what we're doing this year we can start

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.039 
what we're doing this year we can start
with<00:00:10.800> new<00:00:11.309> pouring<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
with new pouring we have this is for the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.939 
with new pouring we have this is for the
5-3<00:00:13.920> bore<00:00:14.099> spacing<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.949> heavy

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
5-3 bore spacing this is for heavy

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.760 
5-3 bore spacing this is for heavy
nitrous<00:00:17.400> 800<00:00:18.330> plus<00:00:18.570> cubic<00:00:18.990> inch<00:00:19.170> motors<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
nitrous 800 plus cubic inch motors and

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.029 
nitrous 800 plus cubic inch motors and
what's<00:00:20.490> unique<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.420> piston<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> it's

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
what's unique about this piston is it's

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.009 
what's unique about this piston is it's
designed<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> stroke<00:00:24.930> basis<00:00:26.779> which<00:00:27.779> also

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
designed on a stroke basis which also

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.939 
designed on a stroke basis which also
allows<00:00:29.390> pin<00:00:30.390> buttons<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:31.380> we've<00:00:31.529> done<00:00:31.769> with

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
allows pin buttons what we've done with

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.819 
allows pin buttons what we've done with
this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.059> has<00:00:33.210> an<00:00:33.360> X<00:00:33.540> design<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.649> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this is has it has an X design which is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.389 
this is has it has an X design which is
extremely<00:00:35.250> strong<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.920> prevents<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> skirts

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
extremely strong and prevents the skirts

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
extremely strong and prevents the skirts
from<00:00:38.610> collapsing<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.270> also<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> same

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
from collapsing but also and at the same

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
from collapsing but also and at the same
time<00:00:41.010> we've<00:00:41.250> extended<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.910> pin<00:00:42.090> bosses<00:00:42.510> out

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
time we've extended the pin bosses out

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
time we've extended the pin bosses out
to<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> outer<00:00:43.140> edges<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> piston<00:00:44.129> which

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to the outer edges of the piston which

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.619 
to the outer edges of the piston which
allows<00:00:45.030> us<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.570> run<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> pin<00:00:46.620> button<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.789> also

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
allows us to run a pin button and also

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.950 
allows us to run a pin button and also
we've<00:00:49.079> another<00:00:49.649> feature<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
we've another feature we have in here is

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
we've another feature we have in here is
3d<00:00:51.960> milling<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> inside<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.160> makes<00:00:53.460> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
3d milling on the inside which makes it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.760 
3d milling on the inside which makes it
not<00:00:53.969> only<00:00:54.270> extremely<00:00:54.899> light<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.620> also

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
not only extremely light but also

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.750 
not only extremely light but also
extremely<00:00:56.219> strong<00:00:57.739> I'd<00:00:58.739> also<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.579> show

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
extremely strong I'd also like to show

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.189 
extremely strong I'd also like to show
you<00:00:59.820> our<00:01:00.420> new<00:01:01.379> LS<00:01:01.770> line<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.940> also<00:01:03.750> done

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you our new LS line which is also done

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.590 
you our new LS line which is also done
on<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:05.430> X<00:01:05.780> style<00:01:06.780> forging<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:07.830> allows<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
on an X style forging which allows the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.830 
on an X style forging which allows the
use<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:11.130> reluctor<00:01:11.909> wheel<00:01:12.090> without<00:01:12.659> any

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
use of a reluctor wheel without any

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.070 
use of a reluctor wheel without any
notches<00:01:13.909> internal<00:01:14.909> external<00:01:15.450> bracing<00:01:15.689> which

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
notches internal external bracing which

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.880 
notches internal external bracing which
is<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.619> very<00:01:17.250> strong<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.500> light<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is also very strong and light at the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
is also very strong and light at the
same<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:22.909> another<00:01:23.909> shelfing<00:01:24.600> item<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
same time and another shelfing item that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
same time and another shelfing item that
we<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.369> twisted<00:01:26.820> wedge<00:01:27.000> headed<00:01:28.130> mod

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
we have is the twisted wedge headed mod

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.270 
we have is the twisted wedge headed mod
motor<00:01:30.079> again<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
motor again this this this is on a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
motor again this this this is on a
conventional<00:01:32.820> forging<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
conventional forging with one of the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
conventional forging with one of the
options<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.840> where<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.290> option

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
options we have that where the option

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
options we have that where the option
that<00:01:37.799> comes<00:01:37.950> standard<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> offset<00:01:39.540> pins<00:01:39.840> which

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that comes standard is offset pins which

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.649 
that comes standard is offset pins which
allows<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.650> quiet<00:01:41.220> operation<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:45.299> comes

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
allows for quiet operation and it comes

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
allows for quiet operation and it comes
in<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.020> nine<00:01:46.290> ten<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.369> eleven<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.880> one
