00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.760
 doctor mcfeely 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.270
 look a little green car will 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.650
 along the road 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:17.060
 it gets very slow 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.990
 oh no, there comes black smoke 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.990
 the exhaust 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.279
 and under the bonnet also comes 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.279
 smoking ban 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.100
 now the wheel has fallen off 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.240
 dear car must necessarily to dr mcfeely 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.320
 in the trade instead of just how do you get there 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.040
 Of course we take a tow truck 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.040
 can help you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 and let's go 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.719
 hello doblo mcgee like this little one 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.719
 green car need your help 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 see you soon tow truck nanu what is 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 because it happens here 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.439
 I understand this car has never been 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.289
 at the car service 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.479
 It has never been in a workshop 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.989
 that's not good but do not worry 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 small car dr.med willi will be everything 

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:45.220
 repair 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.250
 Let's start with the engine to a motor 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 always needs enough oil so let us 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.170
 top up with some oil as well 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.030
 Now we change the air filter 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.260
 prevents that courageous air inside 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.260
 of the car 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:26.340
 but the filter is dirty we have to 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.379
 throw it away and through a new one 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.379
 replace clean filter 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:45.019
 now we can cool the water 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.019
 on 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.269
 the engine gets very hot during the ride 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.599
 Hot, that's why he needs this water 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.599
 for cooling 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.440
 Well done with it 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.989
 but we are not finished yet, the 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.640
 liquid for the wiper is 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.640
 also almost empty 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.650
 the film 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.360
 the engine room is ready 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:52.120
 we can see the dome were still running what na 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.200
 Of course we have to assemble a new wheel 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.269
 the car is ready to go again 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.959

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.959

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.489
 I hope that in the future all cars in 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.980
 a workshop a regular service 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.860

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.780
