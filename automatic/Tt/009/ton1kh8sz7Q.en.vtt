00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
before we got the spectating to menu the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.049 
before we got the spectating to menu the
first<00:00:44.100> score<00:00:44.700> blah<00:00:44.969> blah<00:00:45.710> after<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:47.190> gone<00:00:47.520> and

first score blah blah after all gone and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
first score blah blah after all gone and
if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> look<00:00:49.079> closely<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
if you look closely you can see where it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
if you look closely you can see where it
doesn't<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.730> great<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.420> I'll<00:00:51.570> get

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
doesn't look that great but I'll get

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.040 
doesn't look that great but I'll get
into<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.379> after<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.360> endo<00:00:54.719> v2<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
into that after then we got endo v2 I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.529 
into that after then we got endo v2 I
find<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.379> looks<00:00:55.530> better<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> mw2<00:00:56.360> these<00:00:57.360> are

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
find it looks better in mw2 these are

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.639 
find it looks better in mw2 these are
before<00:00:58.940> there<00:00:59.940> is<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.390> after<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> spectating

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
before there is our after the spectating

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
before there is our after the spectating
is<00:01:01.829> completely<00:01:02.699> gone<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> what's<00:01:04.409> great

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is completely gone and what's great

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
is completely gone and what's great
about<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:05.460> usually<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:06.119> you'd

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
about this is because usually what you'd

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
about this is because usually what you'd
have<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> you'd<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.470> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
have to do is you'd have to take your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.240 
have to do is you'd have to take your
clip<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.939> scale<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> try<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
clip you have to scale it in and try to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
clip you have to scale it in and try to
get<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.150> much<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> screen<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> can

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
get as much of the screen that you can

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.219 
get as much of the screen that you can
and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.250> give<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.659> low<00:01:15.930> quality

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and then give this really low quality

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
and then give this really low quality
output<00:01:17.009> after<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:17.909> pretty

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
output after that because you're pretty

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.950 
output after that because you're pretty
much<00:01:18.619> quartering<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:20.420> taking<00:01:21.420> away<00:01:21.540> about

that's been around since 8 on a certain
it's<00:01:47.430> CC<00:01:47.880> simple<00:01:48.390> wire<00:01:48.630> removal<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.619> what

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it's CC simple wire removal and what

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
it's CC simple wire removal and what
this<00:01:49.950> tool<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.310> designed<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> when

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
this tool is designed to do is when

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
this tool is designed to do is when
you've<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.020> real-life<00:01:52.770> footage<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.430> actors

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you've got real-life footage of actors

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.109 
you've got real-life footage of actors
say<00:01:54.560> jumping<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> high<00:01:56.579> building<00:01:56.610> or

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
say jumping off a high building or

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.359 
say jumping off a high building or
something<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.890> safe<00:01:59.100> about

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
something and they want to be safe about

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.010 
something and they want to be safe about
it<00:01:59.430> look<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.119> them<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.329> harness<00:02:00.540> it'll<00:02:00.930> get

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it look at them a harness it'll get

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
it look at them a harness it'll get
super<00:02:01.380> thin<00:02:01.590> wires<00:02:01.860> nuts<00:02:02.729> what's<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
super thin wires nuts what's there and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
super thin wires nuts what's there and
then<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.409> post<00:02:04.680> I'll<00:02:04.920> actually

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
then when they go in post I'll actually

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.639 
then when they go in post I'll actually
use<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> remove<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> wires<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> what

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
use this to remove the wires and what

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.150 
use this to remove the wires and what
this<00:02:07.799> effect<00:02:08.129> essentially<00:02:08.520> does<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
this effect essentially does is it's a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.980 
this effect essentially does is it's a
it<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.370> kind<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> displaces<00:02:14.390> there's<00:02:14.930> a

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it just kind of displaces there's a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.570 
it just kind of displaces there's a
couple<00:02:15.140> removal<00:02:15.650> styles<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.160> place<00:02:16.460> is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
couple removal styles this place is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.970 
couple removal styles this place is
pretty<00:02:16.790> much<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> best<00:02:17.210> but<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.480> displaces

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
pretty much the best but it displaces

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.720 
pretty much the best but it displaces
fades<00:02:18.980> offsets<00:02:19.700> or<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:20.930> horizontal<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
fades offsets or just horizontal and it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.630 
fades offsets or just horizontal and it
it<00:02:22.730> moves<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.270> pixels<00:02:23.720> around<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.350> inward<00:02:24.890> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it moves to pixels around it inward to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.870 
it moves to pixels around it inward to
cover<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.650> whatever<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.250> wire<00:02:28.490> but

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
cover up whatever if there's a wire but

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.130 
cover up whatever if there's a wire but
in<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.060> case<00:02:29.240> we're<00:02:29.390> actually<00:02:29.510> covering<00:02:29.930> up

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
in this case we're actually covering up

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.380 
in this case we're actually covering up
or<00:02:30.620> spectating<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.550> things<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:31.970> so

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
or spectating and things like that so

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.880 
or spectating and things like that so
I'm<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:32.930> gonna<00:02:33.080> quickly<00:02:33.320> show<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.620> how<00:02:33.740> we

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
I'm just gonna quickly show you how we

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.670 
I'm just gonna quickly show you how we
use<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.520> honestly<00:02:34.850> plop<00:02:35.210> it<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.560> then

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
use this we honestly plop it on and then

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.730 
use this we honestly plop it on and then
we're<00:02:36.770> gonna<00:02:36.860> take<00:02:37.070> our<00:02:37.220> point<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:38.620> put<00:02:39.620> it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
we're gonna take our point to a put it

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.540 
we're gonna take our point to a put it
right<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.520> middle<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.120> spectating

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
right in the middle on the spectating

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.770 
right in the middle on the spectating
point<00:02:43.720> B<00:02:44.720> we're<00:02:45.260> gonna<00:02:45.350> put<00:02:45.620> over<00:02:45.920> here<00:02:46.780> I'm

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
point B we're gonna put over here I'm

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.170 
point B we're gonna put over here I'm
just<00:02:47.960> gonna<00:02:48.050> make<00:02:48.260> sure<00:02:48.320> their<00:02:48.590> heights<00:02:48.890> are

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
just gonna make sure their heights are

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
just gonna make sure their heights are
identical<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.440> then<00:02:51.620> we're<00:02:51.740> just<00:02:51.770> gonna

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
identical and then we're just gonna

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.000 
identical and then we're just gonna
increase<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.210> thickness<00:02:53.560> you'll<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.800> it'll

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
increase the thickness you'll see it'll

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.000 
increase the thickness you'll see it'll
start<00:02:55.040> squishing<00:02:55.610> everything<00:02:56.300> inward<00:02:56.720> you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
start squishing everything inward you

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.400 
start squishing everything inward you
just<00:02:58.010> go<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.220> uni<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.090> then<00:02:59.320> there<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.350> go

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
just go to uni and then there you go

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.320 
just go to uni and then there you go
it's<00:03:00.950> gone<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.640> can<00:03:01.820> mess<00:03:02.030> with<00:03:02.060> these

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
it's gone and you can mess with these

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.130 
it's gone and you can mess with these
slopes

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
slopes

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.920 
slopes
sometimes<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.650> is<00:03:03.800> good<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:05.090> really<00:03:05.240> depends

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
sometimes this is good it really depends

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.860 
sometimes this is good it really depends
you<00:03:05.990> can<00:03:06.110> mess<00:03:06.260> with<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.470> mirror<00:03:06.950> I'll<00:03:07.100> set<00:03:07.870> see

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
you can mess with a mirror I'll set see

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.030 
you can mess with a mirror I'll set see
right<00:03:09.080> there<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:10.100> perfect<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.860> then<00:03:12.860> that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
right there it's perfect and then that

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.830 
right there it's perfect and then that
fades<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.520> little<00:03:13.670> bit<00:03:13.760> more<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.360> it's

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
fades in a little bit more and it's

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.710 
fades in a little bit more and it's
pretty<00:03:15.050> unrecognizable<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.980> mean<00:03:16.240> if<00:03:17.240> you<00:03:17.660> were

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
pretty unrecognizable I mean if you were

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.480 
pretty unrecognizable I mean if you were
to<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:18.110> look<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.800> stuff<00:03:19.010> down<00:03:19.250> here

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
to really look like this stuff down here

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.040 
to really look like this stuff down here
can<00:03:19.700> be<00:03:19.790> tricky<00:03:20.180> cuz<00:03:20.390> there's<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.630> lot<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.930> it

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
can be tricky cuz there's a lot of it

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.820 
can be tricky cuz there's a lot of it
covers<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> large<00:03:21.740> area<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.790> actually<00:03:22.970> see

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
covers a large area you can actually see

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.070 
covers a large area you can actually see
we<00:03:24.830> zoom<00:03:25.100> in<00:03:25.340> here<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.450> see<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.840> there's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
we zoom in here you can see that there's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.750 
we zoom in here you can see that there's
actually<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> blurring<00:03:28.100> kind<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.580> thing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
actually like a blurring kind of thing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.940 
actually like a blurring kind of thing
going<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.170> be<00:03:30.320> touched<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.770> in

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
going on and that can be touched up in

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.860 
going on and that can be touched up in
post<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.570> like<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.870> actually<00:03:34.209> take<00:03:35.209> you

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
post but like you can actually take you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.660 
post but like you can actually take you
could<00:03:36.020> somewhat<00:03:36.410> fade<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> couple

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
could somewhat fade this with a couple

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.620 
could somewhat fade this with a couple
different<00:03:37.790> tricks<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.330> are<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.420> little<00:03:38.510> more

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
different tricks that are a little more

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.320 
different tricks that are a little more
advanced<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:40.430> thing<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.640> once<00:03:41.090> you're

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
advanced but the thing is once you're

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.240 
advanced but the thing is once you're
once<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.810> got<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.110> fully<00:03:42.500> going<00:03:42.950> in<00:03:43.100> your

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
once you got that fully going in your

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.420 
once you got that fully going in your
edit<00:03:43.580> once<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.630> pop<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.140> like<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.530> nice<00:03:45.770> CC

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
edit once you pop on like a nice CC

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.759 
edit once you pop on like a nice CC
which<00:03:47.000> I'll<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:47.330> do<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.750> now

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.860 

so<00:03:53.769> we<00:03:54.010> throw<00:03:54.219> on<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.859> was<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.040> good<00:03:57.250> CC<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.750> a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
so we throw on it was a good CC it's a

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.660 
so we throw on it was a good CC it's a
good<00:03:59.019> CC<00:03:59.409> if<00:03:59.469> it's<00:03:59.650> also<00:03:59.799> on<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.040> clip<00:04:00.340> though

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.309 

yeah<00:04:06.670> so<00:04:07.150> if<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.299> throw<00:04:07.390> on<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.599> nice<00:04:07.720> CC<00:04:08.140> there

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
yeah so if you throw on a nice CC there

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.479 
yeah so if you throw on a nice CC there
it's<00:04:08.470> not<00:04:08.560> nearly<00:04:08.920> as<00:04:09.069> recognizable<00:04:11.280> just<00:04:12.280> a

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
it's not nearly as recognizable just a

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.819 
it's not nearly as recognizable just a
little<00:04:12.909> bright<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.209> see<00:04:13.659> so<00:04:14.319> let's<00:04:14.530> take<00:04:14.680> our

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
little bright I see so let's take our

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.259 
little bright I see so let's take our
levels<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.519> bring<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:16.000> up<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.699> not<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:18.850> CC

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
levels and bring it up this is not a CC

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.060 
levels and bring it up this is not a CC
tutorial<00:04:19.479> level<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:22.650> there<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.710> go<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.009> you

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
tutorial level so there you go so you

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.620 
tutorial level so there you go so you
got<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.190> nice<00:04:24.310> little<00:04:24.610> CC<00:04:25.090> on<00:04:25.240> there<00:04:25.389> it's<00:04:25.509> not

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
got a nice little CC on there it's not

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.850 
got a nice little CC on there it's not
nearly<00:04:25.900> as<00:04:26.050> noticeable<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.590> mean<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
nearly as noticeable I mean the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.980 
nearly as noticeable I mean the
spectator<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.490> completely<00:04:28.240> unrecognizable

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
spectator is completely unrecognizable

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.839 
spectator is completely unrecognizable
but<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.590> still<00:04:29.800> got<00:04:29.949> these<00:04:30.130> down<00:04:30.430> here<00:04:30.490> but

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
but you still got these down here but

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.480 
but you still got these down here but
then<00:04:30.970> if<00:04:31.090> you're<00:04:31.210> throwing<00:04:31.449> on<00:04:32.310> throwing<00:04:33.310> on

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
then if you're throwing on throwing on

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.499 
then if you're throwing on throwing on
some<00:04:33.669> black<00:04:33.940> bars<00:04:34.300> on<00:04:34.570> top<00:04:34.599> of<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:39.360> if<00:04:40.360> you

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
some black bars on top of that if you

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.960 
some black bars on top of that if you
can<00:04:40.660> just<00:04:40.840> have<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.110> at<00:04:41.229> say<00:04:41.470> 5%<00:04:41.740> here<00:04:42.520> like

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
can just have it at say 5% here like

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.790 
can just have it at say 5% here like
that<00:04:43.270> that's<00:04:43.539> hardly<00:04:44.050> noticeable<00:04:44.380> at<00:04:44.560> all<00:04:44.650> if

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
that that's hardly noticeable at all if

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.070 
that that's hardly noticeable at all if
you're<00:04:44.919> doing<00:04:45.039> a<00:04:45.160> really<00:04:45.430> intense<00:04:46.389> cinematic

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
you're doing a really intense cinematic

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.960 
you're doing a really intense cinematic
then<00:04:47.259> it's<00:04:47.530> not<00:04:47.830> even<00:04:47.889> gonna<00:04:48.250> show<00:04:48.370> up<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.880> you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
then it's not even gonna show up and you

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.370 
then it's not even gonna show up and you
don't<00:04:49.120> have<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.360> zoom<00:04:49.599> in<00:04:49.840> you're<00:04:50.050> still<00:04:50.259> gonna

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
don't have to zoom in you're still gonna

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.310
