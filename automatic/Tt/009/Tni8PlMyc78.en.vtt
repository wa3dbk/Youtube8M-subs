00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
sources this is because by default

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.770 
sources this is because by default
Android<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:44.129> blocks<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:47.780> installation

blocked the installation but since this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.560 
blocked the installation but since this
is<00:01:04.049> an<00:01:04.170> OK<00:01:04.559> file<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.790> verified<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> be

clean we can install it no problem and
have<00:01:11.520> no<00:01:11.729> malware<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.570> you'll<00:01:12.900> need<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> first

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
have no malware so you'll need to first

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
time in reboot really kind of a pain but

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.200 
time in reboot really kind of a pain but
there's<00:02:03.299> nothing<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.049> about<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
there's nothing we can do about that so

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
there's nothing we can do about that so
they<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.329> created<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.099> zip<00:02:08.099> file<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
they have created the zip file to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.729 
they have created the zip file to
prevent<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:09.479> happening<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.649> is

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
prevent that from happening and there is

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.360
