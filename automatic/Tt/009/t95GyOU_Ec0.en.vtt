00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.919 

it's<00:00:01.430> hard<00:00:01.640> to<00:00:01.699> believe<00:00:02.000> it's<00:00:02.210> been<00:00:02.389> 16<00:00:02.899> years

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:02.929 
it's hard to believe it's been 16 years

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.829 
it's hard to believe it's been 16 years
since<00:00:03.260> we<00:00:03.679> saw<00:00:03.889> the<00:00:04.310> first<00:00:04.600> generation<00:00:05.600> Audi

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
since we saw the first generation Audi

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.570 
since we saw the first generation Audi
TT<00:00:06.350> and<00:00:06.529> I<00:00:06.560> think<00:00:06.770> that's<00:00:06.920> testament<00:00:07.460> to<00:00:07.549> just

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
TT and I think that's testament to just

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.720 
TT and I think that's testament to just
how<00:00:07.819> radical<00:00:08.480> that<00:00:09.019> first<00:00:09.380> design<00:00:09.740> was<00:00:09.980> well

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
how radical that first design was well

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.020 
how radical that first design was well
this<00:00:11.030> is<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:11.540> all-new<00:00:11.980> third-generation<00:00:13.030> TT

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
this is the all-new third-generation TT

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.030 
this is the all-new third-generation TT
and<00:00:14.360> as<00:00:14.719> you<00:00:14.840> can<00:00:14.990> see<00:00:15.200> it's<00:00:15.380> not<00:00:15.559> exactly<00:00:15.920> a

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
and as you can see it's not exactly a

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.730 
and as you can see it's not exactly a
radical<00:00:16.609> or<00:00:16.880> shocking<00:00:17.500> evolution<00:00:18.500> of<00:00:18.619> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
radical or shocking evolution of the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.470 
radical or shocking evolution of the
design<00:00:19.100> but<00:00:19.340> it's<00:00:19.490> still<00:00:19.670> a<00:00:19.730> stunning<00:00:20.210> thing

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
design but it's still a stunning thing

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.570 
design but it's still a stunning thing
to<00:00:20.689> look<00:00:20.840> at<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.680> biggest<00:00:21.980> changes<00:00:22.369> where

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
to look at the biggest changes where

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.740 
to look at the biggest changes where
we're<00:00:22.699> in<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.880> right<00:00:23.029> place<00:00:23.090> for<00:00:23.359> that

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
we're in the right place for that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.109 
we're in the right place for that
you'll<00:00:24.410> notice<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:25.010> much<00:00:25.400> more<00:00:25.730> angular

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
you'll notice this much more angular

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.359 
you'll notice this much more angular
front<00:00:26.900> grille<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:27.410> Audi<00:00:27.560> beds<00:00:27.949> well<00:00:28.220> that's

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
front grille the Audi beds well that's

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.220 
front grille the Audi beds well that's
moved<00:00:28.609> from<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.849> grille<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.720> bonnet<00:00:30.050> and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
moved from the grille to the bonnet and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.560 
moved from the grille to the bonnet and
you've<00:00:30.349> got<00:00:30.500> these<00:00:30.650> slimmer<00:00:31.160> LED<00:00:32.059> headlights

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
you've got these slimmer LED headlights

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.479 
you've got these slimmer LED headlights
there's<00:00:33.170> some<00:00:33.290> more<00:00:33.440> changes<00:00:33.920> around<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
there's some more changes around the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.670 
there's some more changes around the
side<00:00:34.730> you'll<00:00:35.300> barely<00:00:35.570> notice<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.260> difference

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
side you'll barely notice the difference

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.040 
side you'll barely notice the difference
but<00:00:36.860> there<00:00:37.070> is<00:00:37.190> actually<00:00:37.730> an<00:00:37.850> extra<00:00:38.149> 37

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
but there is actually an extra 37

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.080 
but there is actually an extra 37
millimeters<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.219> wheelbase<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.000> that

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
millimeters in the wheelbase and that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.610 
millimeters in the wheelbase and that
means<00:00:41.300> there's<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.809> little<00:00:42.050> bit<00:00:42.140> more<00:00:42.350> space

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
means there's a little bit more space

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.000 
means there's a little bit more space
inside<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.370> 13<00:00:44.120> liters<00:00:44.629> more<00:00:45.200> boot<00:00:45.410> space<00:00:45.680> as

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
inside and 13 liters more boot space as

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.220 
inside and 13 liters more boot space as
well<00:00:46.160> now<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:47.000> this<00:00:47.360> car<00:00:47.660> like

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
well now that's because this car like

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.900 
well now that's because this car like
pretty<00:00:48.500> much<00:00:48.530> everything<00:00:48.950> else<00:00:49.219> in<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.489> VW

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
pretty much everything else in the VW

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.110 
pretty much everything else in the VW
Group<00:00:50.059> is<00:00:50.270> based<00:00:50.539> on<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:50.840> MQB<00:00:51.559> platform<00:00:52.120> that

Group is based on the MQB platform that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.600 
Group is based on the MQB platform that
means<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.600> lot<00:00:53.719> lighter<00:00:54.250> 140<00:00:55.250> kilos

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
means it's a lot lighter 140 kilos

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.639 
means it's a lot lighter 140 kilos
lighter<00:00:55.879> than<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.690> first<00:00:56.870> generation<00:00:56.960> car

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
lighter than the first generation car

and 50 kilos lighter than its
predecessor<00:01:00.460> as<00:01:01.460> well<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:02.149> also<00:01:02.300> means<00:01:02.600> that

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
predecessor as well it also means that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.049 
predecessor as well it also means that
it<00:01:03.140> can<00:01:03.289> use<00:01:03.320> all<00:01:03.739> those<00:01:03.980> engines<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:04.909> we're

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
it can use all those engines that we're

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.640 
it can use all those engines that we're
now<00:01:05.210> familiar<00:01:05.449> with<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> Gulf<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:06.500> this

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
now familiar with in the Gulf so this

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.270 
now familiar with in the Gulf so this

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
various 2-liter TDI is 2-liter TFSI but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.840 
various 2-liter TDI is 2-liter TFSI but
this<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.150> flagship<00:01:11.659> TTS<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.860> 306

level again it's a whole new concept and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.710 
level again it's a whole new concept and
interior<00:01:34.220> design<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.759> all<00:01:34.850> about<00:01:35.060> reducing

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
interior design it's all about reducing

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.719 
interior design it's all about reducing
clutter<00:01:36.229> by<00:01:36.560> as<00:01:36.680> much<00:01:36.890> as<00:01:37.070> possible<00:01:37.280> so

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
clutter by as much as possible so

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.580 
clutter by as much as possible so
there's<00:01:38.540> some<00:01:38.659> really<00:01:38.810> clever<00:01:39.049> touches

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
there's some really clever touches

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.490 
there's some really clever touches
things<00:01:39.829> like<00:01:40.070> these<00:01:40.689> aircon<00:01:41.689> dials<00:01:42.170> here<00:01:42.350> they

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
things like these aircon dials here they

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.719 
things like these aircon dials here they
actually<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.979> controls<00:01:43.399> for<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.700> fan

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
actually have the controls for the fan

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.639 
actually have the controls for the fan
and<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.119> temperature<00:01:44.570> within<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.439> dolls

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and the temperature within the dolls

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.039 
and the temperature within the dolls
themselves<00:01:45.950> rather<00:01:46.520> than<00:01:46.729> taking<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.240> useful

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
themselves rather than taking up useful

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.200 
themselves rather than taking up useful
space<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> dash<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.430> other<00:01:49.700> controls
