00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
angles starting with this one there's a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
angles starting with this one there's a
little<00:01:30.420> notch<00:01:30.750> cut<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.740> right

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
little notch cut into the case right

here you can also flip the case around
and<00:01:35.400> tuck<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.380> ended<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and tuck it in like so just ended up in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.450 
and tuck it in like so just ended up in
a<00:01:38.009> nice<00:01:38.130> typing<00:01:38.670> angle<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:40.740> relaxed

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
a nice typing angle or a more relaxed

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090 
a nice typing angle or a more relaxed
video<00:01:41.820> angle<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.899> three<00:01:43.710> different

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
video angle as well so three different

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
video angle as well so three different
Stan<00:01:44.340> angles<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> doesn't<00:01:45.450> stop<00:01:45.570> there

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
Stan angles but it doesn't stop there

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
Stan angles but it doesn't stop there
let<00:01:46.229> me<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.649> back<00:01:46.890> open<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.970> case<00:01:48.210> also

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
let me get this back open the case also

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.460 
let me get this back open the case also
swivels<00:01:49.740> into<00:01:50.250> portrait<00:01:51.030> mode<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.229> can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
swivels into portrait mode so you can

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.460 
swivels into portrait mode so you can
flip<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> case<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.930> then

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
flip the case around like so and then

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
flip the case around like so and then
stand<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> portrait<00:01:56.820> angle<00:01:57.299> as

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
stand it up in the portrait angle as

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.410 
stand it up in the portrait angle as
well<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.990> tons<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.159> functionality<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
well so tons of functionality with this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
well so tons of functionality with this
case<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.380> doesn't<00:02:01.560> stop<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.729> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
case and it doesn't stop there there is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
case and it doesn't stop there there is
this<00:02:03.060> flap<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.869> hair<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
this flap right hair as you can see and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910 
this flap right hair as you can see and
this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> made<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> place<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.509> hand<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.200> just

this is made to place your hand in just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
this is made to place your hand in just

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to get a better grip on holding the iPad

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.530 
to get a better grip on holding the iPad
so<00:02:10.709> instead<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.730> flipping<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> front

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so instead of like flipping the front

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
so instead of like flipping the front
cover<00:02:12.750> around

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
cover around

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.100 
cover around
like<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.430> many<00:02:14.700> cases<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.720> having

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
like you do with many cases and having

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.540 
like you do with many cases and having
it<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.500> flap<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:17.010> over<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> place

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
it kind of flap all over the place

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.760 
it kind of flap all over the place
they've<00:02:18.150> cut<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.750> notch<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.590> will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
they've cut out this notch if you will

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.580

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
for holding on or getting a better grip

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.370 
for holding on or getting a better grip
on<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.130> iPad<00:02:23.670> air<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.690> mentioned<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> lack

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
on the iPad air now I mentioned the lack

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.340 
on the iPad air now I mentioned the lack
of<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.890> secondary<00:02:26.880> mic<00:02:27.120> cut<00:02:27.480> out<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.080> if

of the secondary mic cut out on this if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.670 
of the secondary mic cut out on this if
you<00:02:28.500> put<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> into<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:30.200> portrait<00:02:31.200> position

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
you put it into the portrait position

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.590 
you put it into the portrait position
I'll<00:02:32.160> notice<00:02:32.550> there<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.850> cutout<00:02:33.210> on<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
I'll notice there is a cutout on the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.960 
I'll notice there is a cutout on the
back<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.230> piece<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.980> you'll<00:02:35.610> still<00:02:35.820> be

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
back of this piece so you'll still be

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.370 
back of this piece so you'll still be
able<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.120> use<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.360> secondary<00:02:36.900> Mike<00:02:37.140> it's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
able to use that secondary Mike it's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.660 
able to use that secondary Mike it's
just<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.770> won't<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.100> able<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.310> use<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.430> in

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
just that you won't be able to use it in

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.250 
just that you won't be able to use it in
this<00:02:38.910> position<00:02:39.420> because<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.080> will<00:02:40.230> be

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
this position because it will be

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.130 
this position because it will be
partially<00:02:41.190> obstructed<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.600> when<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.960> flip

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
partially obstructed but when you flip

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
partially obstructed but when you flip
it<00:02:43.230> into<00:02:43.380> portrait<00:02:43.800> mode<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.340> fine<00:02:44.610> so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it into portrait mode it's just fine so

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.970 
it into portrait mode it's just fine so
again<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.020> case<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> ton<00:02:46.950> of
