I<00:01:57.829> grew<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.159> small<00:01:59.579> towns<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> around<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
I grew up in small towns and around the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.730 
I grew up in small towns and around the
mountains<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> had<00:02:01.110> quite<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> few<00:02:01.469> people

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
mountains so I had quite a few people

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
mountains so I had quite a few people
who<00:02:01.950> had<00:02:02.070> BB<00:02:02.340> guns<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> airsoft<00:02:02.939> guns<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
who had BB guns and airsoft guns and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.310 
who had BB guns and airsoft guns and
stuff<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> bunch<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.960> people<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
stuff and a bunch of people I know

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
stuff and a bunch of people I know
actually<00:02:04.740> got<00:02:04.890> hurt<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.700> airsoft<00:02:06.149> guns<00:02:06.360> and

actually got hurt with airsoft guns and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually got hurt with airsoft guns and
BB<00:02:06.750> guns<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> few<00:02:07.530> youtubers<00:02:08.069> even

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
BB guns and I think a few youtubers even

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.600 
BB guns and I think a few youtubers even
have<00:02:08.879> injuries<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:10.170> their<00:02:10.349> past<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:11.069> airsoft

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
have injuries in their past from airsoft

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
have injuries in their past from airsoft
and<00:02:11.760> BB<00:02:11.970> guns<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and BB guns so

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.030 
and BB guns so
they<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:12.989> pretty<00:02:13.290> dangerous<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.830> got<00:02:13.950> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
they are pretty dangerous you got to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.339 
they are pretty dangerous you got to
wear<00:02:14.190> eye<00:02:14.220> protection<00:02:14.940> especially<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
wear eye protection especially but I

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.890 
wear eye protection especially but I
think<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.400> still<00:02:17.580> fun<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
think it's it's still fun when I was a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.680 
think it's it's still fun when I was a
little<00:02:19.140> kid<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.800> was<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.099> I'd<00:02:20.580> say<00:02:20.849> 12<00:02:21.180> 13

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
little kid when I was like I'd say 12 13

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300 
little kid when I was like I'd say 12 13
years<00:02:21.930> old<00:02:22.110> probably<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.770> when<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.040> did<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
years old probably is when we did it the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.479 
years old probably is when we did it the
most<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.120> basically<00:02:24.870> pretend<00:02:25.410> war<00:02:26.099> we

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
most we would basically pretend war we

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.220

would<00:02:26.610> play<00:02:26.819> war<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.450> would<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:28.020> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230

just the neighborhood kids around the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
neighborhood we would all get really

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.570 
neighborhood we would all get really
bored<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.530> outside<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.310> would<00:02:32.430> run

bored and be outside and we would run

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.850 
bored and be outside and we would run

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
trying to find something to fill our

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.070 
trying to find something to fill our
free<00:02:38.459> time<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:38.970> basically<00:02:39.420> play<00:02:39.599> war<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
free time and we basically play war and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.690 
free time and we basically play war and
we<00:02:40.200> would<00:02:40.319> pretend<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:41.370> these<00:02:41.519> little

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
we would pretend with all these little

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.120 
we would pretend with all these little
pretend<00:02:42.150> guns<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.890> run<00:02:43.890> around<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
pretend guns and run around the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.229 
pretend guns and run around the
neighborhood<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.850> shoot<00:02:45.030> at<00:02:45.150> each

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
neighborhood and just shoot at each

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.000 
neighborhood and just shoot at each
other<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.750> yell<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.170> cause<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> bunch<00:02:46.830> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
other and yell and cause a bunch of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.620 
other and yell and cause a bunch of
trouble<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.489> we<00:02:47.790> never<00:02:47.940> got<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.180> any<00:02:48.209> real

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
trouble but we never got in any real

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.970 
trouble but we never got in any real
trouble<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> guess<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.830> was<00:02:49.950> all

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
trouble for it so I guess it was all

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.759 
trouble for it so I guess it was all
right<00:02:50.360> but<00:02:51.360> some<00:02:51.510> people<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:51.930> fanatical

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
right but some people are just fanatical

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.000
