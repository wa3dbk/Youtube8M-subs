low<00:01:30.330> vibration<00:01:30.950> engine<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.550> year<00:01:32.760> we've

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
low vibration engine now this year we've

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.210 
low vibration engine now this year we've
increased<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> power<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.380> 305

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
increased the power it's a 305

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.310 
increased the power it's a 305
horsepower<00:01:35.750> 290<00:01:36.750> foot-pound<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.260> torque

engine<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.400> bringing<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.790> power<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
engine so we're bringing more power to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.000 
engine so we're bringing more power to
the<00:01:39.330> game<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:39.690> year<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.560> other<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.979> that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
the game this year the other thing that

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.130 
the game this year the other thing that
we<00:01:41.340> brought<00:01:41.580> is<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.540> ways<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.840> control

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
we brought is is kind of ways to control

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.469 
we brought is is kind of ways to control
that<00:01:43.290> power<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.310> DC<00:01:44.790> CD<00:01:45.150> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> old

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that power we have a DC CD in the old

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
that power we have a DC CD in the old
STI<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.530> has<00:01:46.710> six<00:01:47.310> manual<00:01:47.670> settings

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
STI but this one has six manual settings

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
STI but this one has six manual settings
in<00:01:48.150> three<00:01:48.360> automatic<00:01:49.020> settings<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.649> addition

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
in three automatic settings in addition

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
in three automatic settings in addition
we've<00:01:50.430> added<00:01:50.580> VDC<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.509> car<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
we've added VDC to this car which is a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
we've added VDC to this car which is a
traction<00:01:52.350> control<00:01:52.670> system<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.360> three<00:01:54.630> modes

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
traction control system with three modes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420 
traction control system with three modes
one<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.950> enthusiasts

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
one of which I know all the enthusiasts

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.830 
one of which I know all the enthusiasts
will<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.970> completely<00:01:57.330> off<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.690> mean

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
will use which is completely off I mean

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
will use which is completely off I mean
it's<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.259> wanted<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> car

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's they wanted to be them in the car

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
it's they wanted to be them in the car
so<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.390> turn<00:02:00.600> off<00:02:00.780> our<00:02:00.930> VDC<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.680> finally

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
so you can turn off our VDC and finally

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
so you can turn off our VDC and finally
