00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 smash bros for nintendo 3ds and wii 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.329
 all this information will be taken from the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.689
 official page of nintendo three games 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.970
 dotcom rumors among other things without 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.680
 nothing else to add let's start with the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 video 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 let's start with the logo here is the logo 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.580
 official of this game in this way it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 they deny men like super smash bros 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.380
 universe among other names given by 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 the fans we can see that it does not have any 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 subtitle your name will be only super 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.690
 smash bros but it is not confirmed yet 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 at least until the e3 of this year 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.360
 2013 there are possibilities that his name be 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.699

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.070

 will be a playable character in this super 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.410
 smash bros thing that in my opinion to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.480

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.480

 that we just told you about this new 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.239

 presence but it is clear that they will be added 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.120
 many others more and some of them go 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.890
 to be totally new in the series as 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.960
 the human villager of the animal saga 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.300
 crossing known as traveler the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.430
 Personal trainer of the Wiifit saga or 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.410
 perhaps the most anticipated of all the great 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.990
 mega man one of the most characters 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300
 recognized from capcom we can wait 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.240
 many surprises in this regard during 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.710
 the next months you can be sure 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.360
 all these fighters will be re 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.120
 balanced compared to what 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.130
 registered in past deliveries of this 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.110
 way will try to be avoided in everything 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.150
 possible what happened with the famous goal 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 cnic of super smash bros 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.530
 the character that became detached 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.690
 due to its manifest superiority in 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.510
 certain areas such as air attacks 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.060
 for example also all the characters 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.860
 pose were new movements some of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.570
 they extracted directly from the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.490
 last productions that have 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.270
 starred in both Wii and 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.550
 nintendo 3ds 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.700
 let's go through the last section of this 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.740
 video graphics engine is the 3ds 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.080
 almost like gamecube whereby 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.090
 this super smash bros does not take much 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.220
 graphic ability as we see it in 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.830
 games like resident evil revelations 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.960
 even so they are good they look very 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.250
 nice and very good visual effects 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.250
 as well as the scenarios 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.930
 in the wii version and the graphics are 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720
 10 times more powerful than in the 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.389
 3ds version this game occupies a large 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.060
 part of the wii graphic engine and the 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.520
 textures in the characters change a lot 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.160
 The backgrounds and effects scenarios are very 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.530
 remarkable in this game having three 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.220
 times better graphics than super smash 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.220
 bros brawl 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.430
