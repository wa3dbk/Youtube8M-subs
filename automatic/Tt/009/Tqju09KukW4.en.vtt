00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
little ratcheting action it goes up and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
little ratcheting action it goes up and
down<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> does<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> where

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.760 
down and what it does is this is where
you'll<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:37.890> put<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.700> crimp<00:00:38.969> bead<00:00:39.180> end

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770

more careful with making sure it's just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.590 
more careful with making sure it's just
the<00:02:04.049> right<00:02:04.170> distance<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.829> me<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:08.600> it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
the right distance for me like so it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.210 
the right distance for me like so it
just<00:02:09.810> takes<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.079> second<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.440> line<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:11.040> then

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
just takes a second to line up and then

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.569 
just takes a second to line up and then
a<00:02:11.459> squeeze<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.470> you're<00:02:13.470> done<00:02:13.709> sometimes<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
a squeeze and you're done sometimes I

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.220 
a squeeze and you're done sometimes I
have<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> hard<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.299> releasing<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.079> have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
have a hard time releasing it so I have

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.370 
have a hard time releasing it so I have
to<00:02:16.320> kind<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:18.209> Jimmy<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.989> get<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.230> out

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
to kind of just Jimmy it to get it out

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.030 
to kind of just Jimmy it to get it out
of<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> these<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> bracelets<00:02:22.980> that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
of there so these are the bracelets that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.979 
of there so these are the bracelets that
my<00:02:23.250> daughter<00:02:23.459> has<00:02:23.730> been<00:02:23.910> making<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.540> she's

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
my daughter has been making and she's

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.840 
my daughter has been making and she's
been<00:02:25.200> doing<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.829> stringing<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.610> I've

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
been doing all the stringing and I've

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.600 
been doing all the stringing and I've
been<00:02:27.090> doing<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.290> crimping<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> what

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
been doing all of the crimping and what

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.729 
been doing all of the crimping and what
I<00:02:29.640> really<00:02:29.940> love<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.140> one-step<00:02:31.530> crimper

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
I really love about the one-step crimper

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.550 
I really love about the one-step crimper
is<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.430> she<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.360> bring<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.660> me<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.320> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
is that she can bring it to me and I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.610 
is that she can bring it to me and I
just<00:02:34.799> slip<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.310> crimp<00:02:35.579> tube<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.620> squeeze

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
just slip on a crimp tube and squeeze

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.430 
just slip on a crimp tube and squeeze
and<00:02:37.950> I'm<00:02:38.160> done<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> used<00:02:39.120> thicker<00:02:39.989> crimp

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and I'm done and I used thicker crimp

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.069 
and I'm done and I used thicker crimp
tubes<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.070> use<00:02:41.370> smaller<00:02:41.970> crimp<00:02:42.390> tubes<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.900> use

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
tubes I use smaller crimp tubes I use

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.949 
tubes I use smaller crimp tubes I use
found<00:02:43.410> ones<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.680> use<00:02:43.829> cylindrical<00:02:44.070> ones<00:02:44.519> and

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
found ones I use cylindrical ones and

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.190 
found ones I use cylindrical ones and
really<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.140> success<00:02:46.620> rate<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:47.070> about<00:02:48.000> 95%<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
really my success rate is about 95% I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.870 
really my success rate is about 95% I
think<00:02:49.380> there<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.590> been<00:02:49.620> two<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.760> I've

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
think there have been two that I've

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.310 
think there have been two that I've
squished<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.780> hasn't<00:02:51.959> been<00:02:52.170> right

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
squished and it just hasn't been right

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.660 
squished and it just hasn't been right
for<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.709> reason<00:02:52.859> or<00:02:53.040> another<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:53.340> that's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
for one reason or another but that's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.120 
for one reason or another but that's
actually<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.120> higher<00:02:54.390> percentage<00:02:55.079> then<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.799> get

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
actually a higher percentage then I get

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.979 
actually a higher percentage then I get
when<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:56.880> my<00:02:56.910> regular<00:02:57.420> crimping

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
when I do it with my regular crimping

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.069 
when I do it with my regular crimping
tools<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:59.310> bottom<00:02:59.670> line<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.600> this

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
tools so my bottom line is that this

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.620 
tools so my bottom line is that this
handy-dandy<00:03:01.620> tool<00:03:01.919> while<00:03:02.699> it<00:03:02.940> looks<00:03:03.209> really

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
handy-dandy tool while it looks really

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.270 
handy-dandy tool while it looks really
weird<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.049> maybe<00:03:04.169> a<00:03:04.320> little<00:03:04.440> intimidating<00:03:05.130> is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
weird and maybe a little intimidating is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.520 
weird and maybe a little intimidating is
very<00:03:05.940> easy<00:03:06.269> if<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:07.049> have<00:03:07.079> low

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
very easy if you have low

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
very easy if you have low
and<00:03:07.680> strength<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.220> does<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.520> take<00:03:08.850> much<00:03:08.880> power

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and strength it does not take much power

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.780 
and strength it does not take much power
to<00:03:10.170> give<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.740> squeeze<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.490> can't

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
to give it the one squeeze you can't

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.540 
to give it the one squeeze you can't
over<00:03:12.120> squeeze<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:13.100> because<00:03:14.100> after<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.400> put

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
over squeeze it because after you put

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.460 
over squeeze it because after you put
your<00:03:14.580> your<00:03:15.000> tube<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.230> one

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
your your tube in it just it's one

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.580 
your your tube in it just it's one
motion<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.100> it's<00:03:17.250> boom<00:03:17.730> about<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.360> much<00:03:18.590> so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
motion and it's boom about that much so

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
motion and it's boom about that much so
it<00:03:19.650> doesn't<00:03:19.920> take<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> lot<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.250> hand<00:03:20.520> strength

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
it doesn't take a lot of hand strength

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.130 
it doesn't take a lot of hand strength
it<00:03:21.060> doesn't<00:03:21.360> take<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> lot<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.750> range<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.080> motion

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
it doesn't take a lot of range of motion

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.320 
it doesn't take a lot of range of motion
so<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.190> you've<00:03:23.610> been<00:03:23.760> having<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> hard<00:03:24.120> time

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
so if you've been having a hard time

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.270 
so if you've been having a hard time
with<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:24.720> hands<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.500> may<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.920> really

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
making going I also think it would be

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.010 
making going I also think it would be
great<00:03:31.709> stocking<00:03:32.069> stuffer<00:03:32.640> material<00:03:33.420> this

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
great stocking stuffer material this

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
great stocking stuffer material this
would<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.620> thing<00:03:34.800> where<00:03:35.010> if

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
would be the kind of thing where if

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.410 
would be the kind of thing where if
you've<00:03:35.580> got<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> joy<00:03:36.000> maker<00:03:36.270> who<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:39.390> know

you've got a joy maker who is you know

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.240 
you've got a joy maker who is you know
maybe<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.290> they<00:03:40.530> wouldn't<00:03:40.739> be<00:03:40.800> willing<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
maybe and they wouldn't be willing to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.710 
maybe and they wouldn't be willing to
splurge<00:03:41.519> for<00:03:41.670> themselves<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.330> would<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.570> a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
splurge for themselves this would be a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.240 
splurge for themselves this would be a
great<00:03:43.230> gift<00:03:43.680> idea<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.260> there<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.650> go<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.980> think
