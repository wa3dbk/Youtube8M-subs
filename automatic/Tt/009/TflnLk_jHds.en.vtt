00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.350
 perfect 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.870
 get to this point where we have 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.169
 all white right values 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.319
 the cross 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.319
 and even the same corresponding colors 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.100
 green 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.339
 red 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.009
 more blue 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.439
 and orange we must go and settle these cubes 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.900
 to arrange these cubes and we must 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.960
 first of all 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.749
 to find 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.739
 one side a cube in which you hold there are the corresponding colors 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.550
 in this case 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.450
 this is the right side 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.440
 why 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.380
 I'll explain why 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.970
 here we have the colors we need 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.350
 which is blue 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 and this is the one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.120
 because it's blue 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.430
 there is red 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 But I need it on this side too 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.540
 because the yellow 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.110
 so I need yellow here 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.320
 we have to keep this cube on this side 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.800
 download 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.830
 work from watch 4 more but we have to work now 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 with this position 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.090
 we have to do another algorithm so that we settle 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.040
 with the same code that happens the same thing as it happens here 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 with this testicles that this destiny of the colors are not correspondents 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.860
 there are no corresponding colors 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 then to fix 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.940
 we must first work 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.320
 from the right position so in this case than this 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.140
 we have our respective colors 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.640
 all three 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.790
 over it 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.870
 to the left 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.870
 ie right in the app 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.190
 above to the right 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.760
 final left 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.690
 above axis to the left 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.989
 where the bass is 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.289
 above to the right 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.959
 left string bass 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 I'm going to check if they have settled down 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.669
 the cubes 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.209
 and I realize that still 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.719
 they didn't settle down 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.910
 so doo I have to repeat again 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.779
 port except intimate 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.779
 we always take the same side read that I love you 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.529
 strict 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.179
 left bar test software 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.489
 no 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.709
 low cesc window 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.849
 low right 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.569
 ok now at first glance all the edges look like their colors 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.959
 correspondents of their sides in fact this is right 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.289
 this has the red emesene on the left 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:00.519
 yellow up 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.269
 and the green I need on the right 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.639
 this heart 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.629
 this place this too 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.719
 it can happen to you to find already a beautiful edge and arranged therefore with i 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.360
 colors 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.560
 already placed in the right position the yellow on hey collateral is with me and i 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
 corresponding colors of the side this does not mean that there is no need to 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.559
 touch it and do not apply any algorithm 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:29.459
 now, to keep everyone going, one side takes the side a wrong side 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.929
 l make the algorithm that sets the colors in the right position 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.899
 we must take 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 the right side and go down from the bottom 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.689
 down 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.419
 to the left 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.419
 then right side pinocchio 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.719
 july arrested 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.769
 we have to repeat this algorithm again until we find ourselves 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.559
 yellow on 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.089
 above 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.349
 right down 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.229
 juke asterix 3 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.849
 fishing 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.359
 julka text 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.359
 1 of 3 sucks 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.099
 left high 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.159
 continuous 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.289
 street 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.719
 witches of the cube the yellow rose 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:29.409
 consequently also the other colors have settled down 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.419
 it is the first edge we have solved now we have to solve the others 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.249
 edges the important item that we begin to descend to our left 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.889
 in the first edge to our left never arrange the other edges but the 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.340
 first to our left 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.090
 now we take spigot to fix it we always and exclusively carry on 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.520
 our right always on the right 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 let's get rid of the same algorithm we did a while ago 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.990
 low street triple spectre 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.379
 arc 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.559
 stress test again 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:11.029
 until you check chuck bass strings bakker you are wrong ie test 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.979
 so new system use this this is a place to the right etimo 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.889
 cast list 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.779
 grex 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.779
 stroop test 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 lastly this remains the same 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.089
 we bring to the right 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.089
 and let's play basketball Trieste 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.430
 shoes stress test 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.800
 we're almost done 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.179
 we are like the low left low fire 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.039
 bass master 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.979
 desktop 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.979
 tourist trophy 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.779
 then you see checchifo 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.689
 cube has been solved I hope to have been useful a greeting to all from antonio
