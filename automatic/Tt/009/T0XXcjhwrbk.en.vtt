 I'm going to show you in this video 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.310
 I use a cleaner that contains acid 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 salicylic one of the mark clear so I 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.590
 I have been using it not be a year two 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 years and a half and only used it when I 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.100
 those granites come out the ingredient 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 principal 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 this 2% salicylic acid 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 any cleaner that contains acid 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.989
 salicylic is going to help you try 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.960
 your little problems of apymet and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 fantastic pimples does not have to be 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 of the brand wants to be a brand of 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.580
 special with having salicylic acid 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.649
 of the main ingredient of the ingredient 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 active will work 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.220
 Fantastic helped me a lot my 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 adolescent times when I had 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 pretty enough to believe the products 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.259
 with salicylic acid they helped me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 enough salicylic acid if it dries 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.819
 the one with a little is very normal that's why 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.399
 that we have to have a moisturizer 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.759
 so that we hydrate depth and 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.560
 protect yourself from the sun is super super 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.110
 important when you use this type of 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
 ingredients because if you do not protect yourself it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 it can stain your skin you can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.009
 burn and it's going to be horrible or not 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 you want to be in that mess ok then 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 during the day after I got the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.810
 my face with this applies a cream 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.090
 moisturizing 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 which at the same time is a sunscreen and I 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 love this brand eucerin touring 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.509
 I buy it in pharmacies and I use it 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.100
 When I have acne and although I do not have acne 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.549
 during the summer it is one of my 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 favorite sunscreens because it's 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.730
 super light super thin does not let you 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.280
 the super fatty heavy skin that shines 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.190
 in the distance it does not feel very nice anymore 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.260
 the time is protecting from the sun with 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.630
 a protective factor of 30 be 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.430
 fantastic and remember a sunscreen 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.040
 at least factor of solar factor 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.900
 30 solar protection will work 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.410
 fantastic which is what I use by day 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.690
 only these two products at night already 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.230
 the night development I go back to wash my 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.319
 face with the same cleaned that 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.920
 contain salicylic acid but in this 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.019
 once used this electric broach that 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.300
 is mine clear they are and that is a 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.550
 wonder to me I love 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 I have used the technique of times 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.600
 about 6 years but I no longer use it as 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.420
 before I used it all 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.150
 nights will no longer use once a 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.430
 week once every two weeks but 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.230
 it's still a wonder and always 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.120
 It always gets me out of trouble when I 'm 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.660
 very granite over there I put a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.750
 cleaner and then start simple 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.180
 applied so to speak and it's fantastic 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.030
 you do not have to have mine clear sony 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.310
 or any little thing sometimes like that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.990
 there is no need I have it because I 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.090
 like to take things to an extreme but 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.720
 there is no need for you to have it 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 night 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.510
 I use this moisturizer of the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.730
 mark wake to see this is a trend 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.410
 Basic moisturizer has no protector 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.800
 solar has absolutely nothing to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.110
 for imagined piety is a cream 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.880
 basic moisturizer that you do not have to 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.030
 have the mark of this the work because not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.610
 if you have pharmacies of any brand 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.100
 just be a moisturizer 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.760
 basic to hydrate your skin and I already know 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.220
 apply and ready now for the point 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.100
 end not to finish the treatment of 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.260
 your acne and what you have to have or 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.820
 you have to have in your in your kit 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.490
 survival is an acid treatment 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.520
 salicylic but this is only 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.380
 apply in each of the granites this 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.660
 it's a wonder I love no 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.150
 I have been using it in breasts 8 or 10 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.250
 years or so this is the brand 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.320
 clean clear and also sell it in 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.240
 pharmacies and this one that applies in each 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.880
 one of the granites when you apply it 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.280
 if you feel that you burn a little but 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.440
 it's very normal he's doing his job and 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.330
 I would dare to say that this 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.850
 dry the pimples of the night to the 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.050
 tomorrow to me all fusion times 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.880
 every time I have a big hall 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.820
 pimple I apply 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.910
 it seems much more reduced not so red and 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.530
 the look looks much better if you're not going to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.560
 ask and in my country where what 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.450
