00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.140 
running a window off a live thumb drive
necessarily<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.980> runs<00:03:10.400> pretty<00:03:10.579> well<00:03:10.700> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
necessarily but it runs pretty well it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.840 
necessarily but it runs pretty well it's
very<00:03:11.420> manageable<00:03:11.810> as<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:12.500> see

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
very manageable as you can see

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.920 
very manageable as you can see
everything<00:03:13.850> looks<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.209> windows<00:03:14.540> window

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
everything looks like a windows window

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.660 
everything looks like a windows window
and<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.769> manage<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.160> from<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.370> taskbar

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
and you can manage it from the taskbar

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.160 
and you can manage it from the taskbar
and<00:03:17.000> that's<00:03:17.690> about<00:03:17.810> it

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
and that's about it

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.170 
and that's about it
so<00:03:18.350> thanks<00:03:18.739> very<00:03:18.769> much<00:03:18.950> for<00:03:19.100> watching<00:03:19.280> and
