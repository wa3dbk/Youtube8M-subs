00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.220
 Hope in the Bible 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.500
 Today's Old Testament Theology continues to explore 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:25.540
 Is there a theme throughout the Old Testament theological teachings? 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.900
 And string the entire Old Testament 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.960
 About 90 years ago, it was proposed to use "about" as the core. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.010
 But it is difficult for us to find covenant-related topics in rumors, Ecclesiastes, or Prophets. 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 So "about" may not be the right choice. 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.370
 So many people have put forward many different opinions. 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.220
 I think the idea put forward by scholar Gerhard Hasel is the most correct. 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.800
 The core of Old Testament theology is Yawei 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 He is God 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 But I think there is another answer worth considering. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.740
 Especially in this season, it is God’s promise 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.290
 We can regard the Old Testament as a series of promises and fulfillments. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.680
 Achieving in some respects has become a promise, so constantly 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.360
 But are these multiple promises? 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.420
 Or pointing to a promise? 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 Dr. Walter Kaiser believes that "the only promise" is the theological core of the Old Testament 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.560
 I have some doubts about this, but I can confirm and agree 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.040
 This single promise is a string of the entire Old Testament 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.120
 You ask: What is this promise? 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.630
 This promise existed as early as the third chapter of Genesis. 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.000
 When God speaks to the sinful Eve 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.960
 God said that the descendants of women will hurt the head of the snake. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.150
 This is very mysterious 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.540
 Who is pointing? 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 Then there is another promise. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.099
 Chapter 12 of Genesis 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.690
 God told Abram, I will give you the child you are looking forward to. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.251
 I will give you the land I am looking forward to, but I will give you another thing. 

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:43.340
 Your ethnicity will be a blessing to all nations. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.099
 Hm 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.540
 Your descendants want to hurt the head of the snake. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.459
 Your ethnicity will make the nations blessed. 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.180
 When the Hebrews entered Egypt, the number was only 70 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.680
 When they left Egypt, they became big powers. 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.390
 The promise of this part has been achieved. 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.000
 The child has been acquired before Abram’s lifetime. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.890
 The family has taken shape when it was in Egypt. 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.879
 After they got the land, they seemed to lose focus. 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.129
 We got what we got, God can do something else. 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:36.849
 So instead of going forward, they are sinking down, as described by the Judges. 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.160
 What about the third promise? 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 Your family will be the blessing of all nations 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.860
 God gave another promise. 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.540
 Give David's promise. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.100
 Just like all the great Near East kings, David wants to build a memorial building. 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.540
 He is eager to cover the temple of God 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.300
 But God’s reaction is very strange. 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.650
 He said that he does not need a home. 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.720
 I have lived in the tent for hundreds of years. 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.030
 However, David, I tell you, I want to build a home for you. 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.400
 Your descendants are to sit on the throne of Israel. 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.710
 Always blessed. 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.389
 Yes. 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.729
 The Israeli people are now refocusing on the future. 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.590
 Wonderful, the David family is on the throne of Judah. 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.919
 For 350 years 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.130
 Perhaps there are very few dynasties besides China. 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.940
 Continue for so long 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.960
 God's promise. 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.040
 The structure of the Old Testament is very interesting 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.060
 When the head of the Torah is over, the promise will be a prophet. 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.580
 Will be bigger than Moses 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.460
 A historical book sorted by the Hebrew Bible, the last volume is Chronicles 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.740
 The end mentions that David’s last son, Joachim, was taken to Babylon. 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.160
 After being released from prison, the rest of his life was supplied by the king of Babylon. 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.690
 Almost all scholars agree that this represents the destruction of Jerusalem. 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.960
 The David dynasty did not perish, but there was no descendant of King David. 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.720
 Sitting on the throne of Jerusalem 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.330
 The English version of the Bible is similar 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.199
 What is the last book? 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.520
 Malachi 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.260
 Malachi talks about the future 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.199
 The one who is the Lord and the messenger of the Lord 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:12.759
 He is the messenger of "covenant" 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.350
 The future one will appear as the sun 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.470
 For example, Liyang will evaporate the last water of dead wood. 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.979
 But it is also Fuyang, bringing healing to the wounded. 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:37.180
 The message throughout the Old Testament is "The story is still not over" 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.830
 Things are still not settled 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.840
 On the one hand, the Old Testament is a tragedy. 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.979
 The Jewish nation cannot continue to keep the contract 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.820
 They have failed again and again 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.199
 They are exiled and then return in the grace of God 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.480
 However they sin again 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.770
 But the Old Testament is not only a tragedy 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.190
 It is a story that hopes to be forever. God has no intention for us. 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:23.360
 He will hold "the only promise" and a child will hurt the head of the snake. 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.430
 Descendants want to bring blessings to all nations 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.910
 David's children will be honored, faithful, and eternal, 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.740
 Rule all over David's throne 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.710
 He is the one in the future. 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:49.319
 The Old Testament is a tragedy, but it is also a book full of infinite glory and hope. 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.460
 He will come. 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:08:05.000
