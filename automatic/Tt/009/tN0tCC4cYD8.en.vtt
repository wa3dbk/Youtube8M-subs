worthy<00:00:15.100> little<00:00:16.630> right

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.400 

things<00:00:31.360> that<00:00:31.540> we<00:00:31.630> take<00:00:31.780> for<00:00:31.840> granted<00:00:31.990> every

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
things that we take for granted every

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.830 
things that we take for granted every
day<00:00:32.770> but<00:00:33.550> what<00:00:33.730> most<00:00:33.880> people<00:00:33.970> don't<00:00:34.210> know<00:00:34.480> is

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
day but what most people don't know is

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.290 
day but what most people don't know is
that<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.260> very<00:00:35.290> complex<00:00:35.920> process<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:37.150> now

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
that in a very complex process so now

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.830 
that in a very complex process so now
folks<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.840> question<00:00:38.200> is<00:00:38.320> how<00:00:38.680> Jimmy

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
folks the question is how Jimmy

00:00:39.840 --> 00:01:02.970 
folks the question is how Jimmy
people<00:00:40.840> how<00:00:40.990> they<00:00:41.140> think<00:00:41.200> freezing<00:00:41.800> work

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.710 

well

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
well

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.820 
well
get<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.470> come<00:01:06.800> on<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.720> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.020 

all<00:01:13.890> right

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.340 

alright<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.300> looks<00:01:20.330> like<00:01:20.690> they<00:01:20.840> may<00:01:20.960> look<00:01:21.170> at

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
alright it looks like they may look at

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.080 
alright it looks like they may look at
papers<00:01:21.830> on<00:01:22.220> how<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:22.550> really<00:01:22.940> breathe

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.820 

respiratory<00:01:29.090> system<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:30.170> what<00:01:30.470> guide<00:01:30.650> the

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
ribs get smaller making the ribs go

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.949 
ribs get smaller making the ribs go
upward<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.549> outward<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.510> diaphragm

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
upward and outward the diaphragm

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080 
upward and outward the diaphragm
floggings<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.440> pushes<00:04:23.039> down<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.789> abdomen

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
floggings and pushes down on the abdomen

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.110 
floggings and pushes down on the abdomen
and<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:24.930> muscles<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.530> abdomen<00:04:25.830> relax<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
and the muscles in the abdomen relax the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.860 
and the muscles in the abdomen relax the
thoracic<00:04:27.389> cavity<00:04:27.810> or<00:04:28.229> chest<00:04:28.860> avi<00:04:29.070> gets<00:04:29.430> bigger

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
thoracic cavity or chest avi gets bigger

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.730 
thoracic cavity or chest avi gets bigger
therefore<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.080> makes<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.470> air<00:04:31.590> pressure

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
therefore this makes the air pressure

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.100 
therefore this makes the air pressure
lower<00:04:32.159> in<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.550> chest<00:04:32.789> cavity<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.990> air

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
lower in the chest cavity the air

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.990 
lower in the chest cavity the air
pressure<00:04:34.139> outside<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:35.010> body<00:04:35.159> is<00:04:35.370> higher<00:04:35.610> than

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
pressure outside the body is higher than

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.749 
pressure outside the body is higher than
the<00:04:36.150> air<00:04:36.240> pressure<00:04:36.479> inside<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.139> chest<00:04:37.470> cavity

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
the air pressure inside the chest cavity

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.279 
the air pressure inside the chest cavity
this<00:04:38.759> allows<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.270> air<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.509> atmosphere<00:04:40.050> to

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
this allows the air and atmosphere to

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.350 
this allows the air and atmosphere to
move<00:04:40.470> into<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:41.009> lungs<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:44.699> all<00:04:44.849> notice<00:04:45.210> will

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
move into the lungs so all notice will

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.010 
move into the lungs so all notice will
be<00:04:45.389> in

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
be in

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.200 
be in
but<00:04:48.020> what<00:04:48.139> about<00:04:48.170> when<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.650> breathe<00:04:48.830> out<00:04:49.210> well

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
but what about when we breathe out well

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.320 
but what about when we breathe out well
now<00:04:50.450> when<00:04:50.780> we<00:04:50.870> breathe<00:04:51.050> out<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.740> called

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
now when we breathe out that is called

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.879 
now when we breathe out that is called
expiration<00:04:53.330> which<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.080> exact<00:04:54.380> opposite

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
expiration which is the exact opposite

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.370

of inspiration the diaphragm and rib

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.780 
of inspiration the diaphragm and rib

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
muscles are locks and the stretchy

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.629 
muscles are locks and the stretchy
tissues<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.540> lungs<00:04:59.810> are<00:05:00.110> drawn<00:05:00.350> back

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
tissues of the lungs are drawn back

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.790 
tissues of the lungs are drawn back
emptying<00:05:01.639> out<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.850> air<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.419> lungs<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:03.560> chest

emptying out the air and lungs the chest

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.350 
emptying out the air and lungs the chest
cavity<00:05:03.980> gets<00:05:04.400> smaller<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.090> air<00:05:05.210> pressure

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.270 
cavity gets smaller and the air pressure
outside<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:06.050> body<00:05:06.200> becomes<00:05:06.650> less<00:05:06.950> than<00:05:06.980> the

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
air pressure inside the cavity air then

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.500 
air pressure inside the cavity air then
