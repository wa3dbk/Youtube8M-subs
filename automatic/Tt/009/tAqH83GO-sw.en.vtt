00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.160
 that in today's video I bring you the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.350
 March favorites as always compiled 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.500
 the products that I liked the most and 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.539
 I taught them and I told you how I was 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.060
 they have seemed because we armed and 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.779
 all that plus everything without going to include 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.910
 some videos like this in product mode of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.789
 modem or product so you can see the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.730
 color the texture and all that and I do not 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.820
 roll up the first product that you 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.900
 I have to teach is this piece of 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.080
 rouge that 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.840
 really he had long had it in the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.290
 uis list when it came out you will not see that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290
 have that 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.090
 magnetic capacity every time he pulls 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.710
 something but I'm very much going to 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 say true but I have a lot of weakness 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 for these box powder and good 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.960
 I will not cheat you when I have to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.010
 When I saw him in the picture he thought a blush 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.659
 more but it is until you see it applied or 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.210
 until you apply it to me I 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.940
 they tried a benefit stand that you do not see 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.220
 the really precious thing that is this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 rouge 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.409
 Y 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.749
 good 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 gives an incredible face look is one 

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:32.609
 of the most beautiful colors that I have not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.679
 I know exactly why because I already tell you 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.940
 which in itself is a color that I do not 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.280
 It seems like very 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.280
 plus 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.890
 striking by another way but without 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.900
 However, put on the skin 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 amazing I've gone back to the old ways with 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.110
 my pain 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.400
 enter link because lately when 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 I edited the videos especially when I 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 I saw in the mirror 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.300
 once made up, it always gave me 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.520
 mind that my skin is very white is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 pretty transparent it bonded the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.539
 veins quite then then once I 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.720
 I was watching the videos and less from here 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.350
 like you if it exists it's there underneath but 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 it is not necessary that it comes out and I have returned to 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.970
 this after my prebase of which is 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.300
 the one that he used whenever he's the one that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.700
 prevents from the folds this 20 to me what 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.700
 what did 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.510
 what helps me is to unify the color 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.430
 give a base color and what 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:40.840
 do not look like those pretty ones that I do not 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.319
 they like it and I'm using it so that it 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:49.690
 set somehow I am using 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.819
 with the brush of no bad faith 84 that is 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.129
 this one that has the beveled cut that 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.290
 is perfect to apply and that already 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.400
 you are seeing another product in the video 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.900
 What do I have to recommend? 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.940
 these formula pencils formula 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.010
 already made my favorites 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.040
 2013 and specifically this tone to black 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.379
 which is from the trio smoky eyes 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.400
 which is the one with the silver colors 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:23.349
 gray and black is the one that I'm using to 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.989
 the upper line of the eyelashes 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.840
 always yes or yes whenever congo mascara 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.340
 I use a black pencil in this case already 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.560
 quite that I'm using this in 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.840
 concrete because with that he got that 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.290
 all the holes you have between the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.430
 eyelashes can not be seen you can see the eyelashes 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.980
 much more full and I recommend it 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:50.150
 very much also because this one and not another 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.730
 well because I usually did this what 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.810
 I did a long time ago and I saw that 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.760
 eyelashes are much thicker 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.330
 but most of the time that I 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.370
 I put up they end up down and this some 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.520
 it has happened to me but normally I do not 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.940
 happens stays up and does not transfer 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.849
 down and I like it very much besides they are 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.890
 pretty cheap they are caught yesterday pesos and 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.180
 I do not know where you can get physical 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:24.010
 formula in spain like lipsticks I do not know 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 but you can see it in the review of the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:31.000
 paddle of zoÃ© goes the logse story that 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.729
 I also use it now I have it 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.290
 used so you can see the texture and 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.300
 such is the beige tone that exactly does not 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.639
 I know what's in beige stay of tone but 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.430
 Well it's called beige and as you see it gives a 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:52.479
 pink tone saw it very nice I love it 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.540
 as it smells it smells like total bauble 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.729
 Lollipop would not clench is lollipop but 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.240
 Red letters is a lifetime I like 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.240
 a lot because 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.240
 song the mirrors or it 's just like that but 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.940
 I like it easy for me to carry it 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.370
 a lipstick that lately that good 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.950
 I'm taking antibiotic and such 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.960
 I have many lips removed 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.240
 right away it's like any neighborhood 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.850
 It costs a lot at the end of the month 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.040
 long been using this as the see 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.190
 What I do is remove a little bit of 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.810
 product of the lid and not give many 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.030
 layers but work the product a lot 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.090
 to penetrate and I like it a lot because 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.200
 leave you very hydrated and it's very nice 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.600
 I like it a lot and it's very cheap and like 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.300
 last this I was using it mostly 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.360
 the first half of the month because they the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.760

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.730
 and I have open a little more to 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.730
 spoil and the states where it is 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.160
 matt bellver in the sex machine tone that 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.080
 this is tiny because it came on the set 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.620
 of the promise 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.800
 or something like that the Christmas that came with 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.800
 the 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:13.240
 Caesar you have an entry of the 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:16.680

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.749
 color a little bit more pink 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.589
 but that I like on my lips 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:33.259
 very much how it is and gives a touch 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:36.679
 natural but almost with a color or a 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.869
