to be assigned to number B you just

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.050 
to be assigned to number B you just

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
assign another pedal to it it's really

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.609 
assign another pedal to it it's really
that<00:02:02.299> easy<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.500> just<00:02:03.799> track<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.640> drop<00:02:05.149> things

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
that easy you just track and drop things

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.710 
that easy you just track and drop things
and<00:02:06.619> swipe<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.520> your<00:02:07.700> finger<00:02:08.090> now<00:02:08.660> you

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and swipe it with your finger now you

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.140 
and swipe it with your finger now you
see<00:02:09.079> that<00:02:09.110> little<00:02:09.590> amp<00:02:09.829> symbol<00:02:10.280> here<00:02:10.549> that<00:02:10.700> am

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
see that little amp symbol here that am

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.449 
see that little amp symbol here that am
symbol<00:02:11.629> could<00:02:11.780> be<00:02:11.930> our<00:02:12.110> internal<00:02:12.950> amplifier

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
symbol could be our internal amplifier

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.910 
symbol could be our internal amplifier
which<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.540> change<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:15.019> this<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.620> push

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
which you change like this you just push

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520 
which you change like this you just push
it<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.280> then<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.970> amplifier<00:02:17.269> list<00:02:17.720> pops<00:02:18.319> up

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it and then the amplifier list pops up

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.340 
it and then the amplifier list pops up
and<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:19.579> change<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.299> for<00:02:20.540> another<00:02:21.019> amplifier

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and you change it for another amplifier

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.220 
and you change it for another amplifier
just<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:23.269> in<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.900> push

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
just like this it's in there you push

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.770 
just like this it's in there you push
down<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.100> now<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.940> amplifiers<00:02:26.510> in

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
down here and now this amplifiers in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.530 
down here and now this amplifiers in
here<00:02:26.989> now<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.639> little<00:02:28.819> M<00:02:29.060> symbol

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
