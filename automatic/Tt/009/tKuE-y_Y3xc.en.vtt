that's why black plays is six and what

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.060 
that's why black plays is six and what
now<00:00:49.699> white<00:00:50.699> can't<00:00:51.030> cast<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.769> that<00:00:52.769> looks

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
now white can't cast here that looks

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
now white can't cast here that looks
like<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> good<00:00:53.550> move<00:00:53.960> but<00:00:54.960> white<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
like a good move but white was in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.330 
like a good move but white was in
aggressive<00:00:56.789> mode<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.269> he<00:00:57.420> played<00:00:57.629> g4

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
aggressive mode so he played g4

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.950

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
attacking the bishop bishop goes to g6

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.410 
attacking the bishop bishop goes to g6
now<00:01:01.710> h4<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:03.090> idea<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.570> f3<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.379> h5<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.940> trap<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
now h4 the idea is f3 and h5 to trap the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
now h4 the idea is f3 and h5 to trap the
bishop<00:01:06.950> black<00:01:07.950> plays<00:01:08.220> Bishop<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.210> b4<00:01:10.880> f3<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
as you can see this could be the next

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.080 
as you can see this could be the next
mode<00:01:14.810> well<00:01:17.900> surprise<00:01:18.900> surprise<00:01:19.790> Bishop<00:01:20.790> takes

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
but why I decided to go for this

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.780 
but why I decided to go for this
variation<00:01:57.250> anyway<00:01:58.470> okay<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.530> we<00:01:59.830> have<00:02:00.010> Bishop

Knight<00:03:07.959> takes<00:03:08.320> on<00:03:08.590> f7

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
Knight takes on f7

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.660 
Knight takes on f7
let's<00:03:11.080> see<00:03:11.290> what<00:03:11.500> happened<00:03:11.920> what<00:03:12.220> will<00:03:12.370> happen

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
let's see what happened what will happen

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.810 
let's see what happened what will happen
if<00:03:12.790> King<00:03:13.420> takes<00:03:13.690> here<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.830> if<00:03:15.130> King<00:03:15.519> takes

if King takes here and if King takes

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.490 
if King takes here and if King takes
then<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.480> variation<00:03:16.810> Queen<00:03:17.320> takes

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
then we have this variation Queen takes

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.550 
then we have this variation Queen takes
on<00:03:17.709> e6<00:03:18.060> King<00:03:19.060> g6<00:03:19.709> Queen<00:03:20.709> f7<00:03:21.040> Queen<00:03:21.970> h6<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.720> next

on e6 King g6 Queen f7 Queen h6 and next

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.090 
on e6 King g6 Queen f7 Queen h6 and next
move<00:03:23.739> is

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
move is

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.810 
move is
checkmate<00:03:25.650> that's<00:03:26.650> why<00:03:26.890> after<00:03:27.570> Knight<00:03:28.570> f7

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
checkmate that's why after Knight f7

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.360 
checkmate that's why after Knight f7

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
take let's have a look what will happen

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.560 
take let's have a look what will happen
if<00:04:14.930> like<00:04:15.290> D<00:04:15.470> take<00:04:15.970> then<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.120> will<00:04:17.239> have<00:04:17.420> this

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
if like D take then we will have this

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.400 
if like D take then we will have this
variation<00:04:18.910> Knight<00:04:19.910> to<00:04:20.120> e5<00:04:21.400> King<00:04:22.400> goes<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.820> g7

variation Knight to e5 King goes to g7

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.560 
variation Knight to e5 King goes to g7
check<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:24.680> after<00:04:25.460> King<00:04:25.700> h6<00:04:26.240> we<00:04:26.390> have

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
check and after King h6 we have

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.190 
check and after King h6 we have
checkmate<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> this<00:04:28.940> variation<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.690> showing

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
checkmate so this variation is showing

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.220 
checkmate so this variation is showing
us<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.620> key<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.760> black<00:04:32.450> rook<00:04:32.720> is<00:04:32.960> not

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
allowed to leave f8 spot that's why

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.310 
allowed to leave f8 spot that's why
black<00:04:38.090> plays<00:04:38.450> Knight<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:39.190> d7<00:04:40.480> then<00:04:41.480> Y<00:04:41.960> takes
