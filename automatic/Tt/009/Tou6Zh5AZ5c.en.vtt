00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.200
 good morning friends today youtube 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.250
 alarm of the symptoms of a beta 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.380
 stressed 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.209
 let's start many of the initiates in the 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.520
 Parenting these usually commit 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.440
 small mistakes that unintentionally or without 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.910
 know can affect the health of 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.070
 our copy 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.130
 but how to know if our beta fish is 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.840
 to taste or feel like in your environment 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 Well, there are certain physical ways that we 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.879
 You can let us know if our beta 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.580
 is or not stressed to start we must 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.620
 evaluate before counting a beta if this one 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.629
 is in the best conditions or if by 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.699
 the opposite is found in a 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.640
 been at first sight depressed 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.890
 why because if we buy a beta that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.110
 you're already stressed you may have moved us 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.660
 to our house and when you pass it to your new 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.550
 home suffers from a lot of stress and can 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.410
 cause death one way is to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 Sometimes a fish is stressed is the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 loss of skin pigmentation this 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 it starts to turn pale with a color 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.680
 as lifeless another way to know if 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.360
 our beta is stressed is to see 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.910
 that it has horizontal lines in 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.910
 the body this usually represents 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.740
 in the fish stress and fear in this case 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.080
 we must observe the possible causes that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 can cause stress if for some 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 reason there is something that bothers you in the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.570
 aquarium it is advisable to take out 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.610
 access to run through the pond or 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.860
 for some fright it is important not to return 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.600
 to do it since this generates stress and 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.250
 it can cause diseases 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.380
 another very common and easy way to 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.210
 detect is the lack of movement of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.799
 our beta if we notice that it rests 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.500
 all the time is because this one is 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.880
 stressed out or possibly sick there is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.369
 pay attention to the space in which 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.920
 find if the space is very small 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.840
 this beta can be expressed as equals 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.149
 way you have to pay attention to the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.100
 water temperature if this one is very 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.470
 cold you can die the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.299
 feed if we notice that our beta 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.280
 stop eating is because something is 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.810
 happening also in these cases that are 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.909
 very aware of what it is that is 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 causing stress in our beta 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.020
 because if he can not get to die of 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.690
 hungry the deal is important no 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.030
 to mistreat or judge our 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.980
 beta we can observe it but not be 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.080
 moving from one place to another since this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.269
 beta with stress can get to jump 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.190
 of the aquarium and generated elections or 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.810
 including death remember that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.760
 our betas need spaces to 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.680
 to be able to live and if we combine them to 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.930
 small spaces with bad temperature and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 much movement can cause them 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.440
 much you to our betta 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.890
 let's remember with happy streaks it would look 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.600
 the following form 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.250
