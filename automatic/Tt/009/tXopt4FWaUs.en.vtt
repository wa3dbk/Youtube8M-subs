the same that he's used the kind of

fleece lining him and although I guess
quite<00:02:06.490> good<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.970> winter<00:02:07.179> it<00:02:07.899> becomes<00:02:08.080> a

quite good in the winter it becomes a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.020 
quite good in the winter it becomes a
little<00:02:08.500> bit<00:02:08.619> clammy<00:02:09.069> especially<00:02:09.700> when<00:02:09.849> you've

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
little bit clammy especially when you've

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.250 
little bit clammy especially when you've
got<00:02:10.060> stuff<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.959> your<00:02:11.110> pockets<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.930> want<00:02:14.110> your

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
got stuff in your pockets you want your

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.170 
got stuff in your pockets you want your
jacket<00:02:14.650> your<00:02:14.860> vest<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.459> quite<00:02:15.760> lightweight

jacket your vest to be quite lightweight

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.430 
jacket your vest to be quite lightweight
I<00:02:16.299> think<00:02:16.540> especially<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:16.959> you're<00:02:17.049> using<00:02:17.260> it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
I think especially if you're using it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.490 
I think especially if you're using it
for<00:02:17.470> travel<00:02:18.810> don't<00:02:19.810> worry<00:02:20.049> though

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
for travel don't worry though

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.250 
for travel don't worry though
you<00:02:20.680> can't<00:02:20.980> necessarily<00:02:21.660> put<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.930> much<00:02:23.110> in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
you can't necessarily put that much in

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can't necessarily put that much in
the<00:02:23.349> pockets<00:02:23.739> because<00:02:23.799> although<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> looks

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the pockets because although it looks

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.570 
the pockets because although it looks
identical<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> Scottevest<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.380> a

dare<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.610> say<00:02:31.530> mediocre<00:02:32.530> clone<00:02:32.829> are<00:02:33.819> not<00:02:34.090> so

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
dare I say mediocre clone are not so

I<00:02:35.170> think<00:02:35.920> somebody<00:02:36.280> has<00:02:36.340> got<00:02:36.640> hold<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
I think somebody has got hold of the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.970 
I think somebody has got hold of the
Scottevest<00:02:37.450> sat<00:02:38.140> down<00:02:38.349> had<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> look<00:02:38.829> at<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
Scottevest sat down had a look at it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
Scottevest sat down had a look at it
measured<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> few<00:02:39.849> things<00:02:40.120> out<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.450> says<00:02:40.599> we

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
measured a few things out and says we

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.830 
measured a few things out and says we
can<00:02:41.440> make<00:02:41.620> one<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.010> if<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.540> want<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
can make one of these if you want to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.050 
can make one of these if you want to
make<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.170> tech<00:02:44.440> enabled<00:02:44.920> vest<00:02:45.459> for<00:02:45.730> carrying

make a tech enabled vest for carrying

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.750 
make a tech enabled vest for carrying
stuff<00:02:46.239> around<00:02:46.510> fine<00:02:47.200> go<00:02:47.650> away<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.519> but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
stuff around fine go away and do it but

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.039 
stuff around fine go away and do it but
to<00:02:48.970> blatantly<00:02:49.650> ripoff<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.630> research

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
to blatantly ripoff all of this research

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.319 
to blatantly ripoff all of this research
and<00:02:53.440> development<00:02:54.040> all<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.579> clever

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329

make<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.910> any<00:02:58.060> better<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.660> think<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.380> need<00:02:59.500> to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
make it any better I think you need to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.930 
make it any better I think you need to
look<00:02:59.739> at<00:02:59.920> your<00:02:59.980> business<00:03:00.130> model<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.639> little<00:03:00.760> bit

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
look at your business model a little bit

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.740 
look at your business model a little bit
better<00:03:01.180> because<00:03:01.410> although<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.980> feels<00:03:03.819> pretty

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
better because although it feels pretty

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.610 
better because although it feels pretty
nice<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:06.519> sizing<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.780> lot<00:03:08.079> smaller<00:03:08.440> than

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
nice the sizing is a lot smaller than

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.920 
nice the sizing is a lot smaller than
you<00:03:08.680> would<00:03:08.799> think<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.030> same<00:03:10.180> size<00:03:10.450> as

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
you would think it is the same size as

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.490 
you would think it is the same size as
this<00:03:11.109> going<00:03:11.319> vest<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.829> large<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.630> it's<00:03:14.109> super

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
this going vest a large but it's super

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.309 
this going vest a large but it's super
tight<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.980> really<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.609> could<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.329> an<00:03:16.630> extra

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
tight so really I could do with an extra

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.080 
tight so really I could do with an extra
large<00:03:17.500> or<00:03:17.769> or<00:03:18.010> maybe<00:03:18.340> even<00:03:18.579> something<00:03:18.790> bigger

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
large or or maybe even something bigger

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.059 
large or or maybe even something bigger
because<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.389> can't<00:03:19.780> use<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.350> pockets<00:03:20.739> as<00:03:20.950> soon

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
because I can't use the pockets as soon

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.800 
because I can't use the pockets as soon
as<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.220> put<00:03:21.400> something<00:03:21.609> in<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.030> feel<00:03:22.450> like<00:03:22.630> I'm

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
as I put something in I feel like I'm

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.090 
as I put something in I feel like I'm
having<00:03:23.049> some<00:03:23.230> kind<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.470> pressure<00:03:23.739> point

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
having some kind of pressure point

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.289 
having some kind of pressure point
torture<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:27.180> sticks<00:03:28.180> quite<00:03:28.840> often

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
torture is it sticks quite often

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.550 
torture is it sticks quite often

it down free me free me free me so a bit
of<00:03:38.799> candle<00:03:39.489> wax<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.299> doesn't<00:03:41.109> help

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
of candle wax on that doesn't help

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.009 
of candle wax on that doesn't help
either<00:03:41.709> if<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.700> get<00:03:42.849> sticky<00:03:43.180> zips<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.660> always

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
use a bit of candle wax but no good it's

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.159 
use a bit of candle wax but no good it's
so<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.609> similar<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.269> they're<00:03:49.570> even<00:03:50.019> got

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
so it's similar that they're even got

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.460 
so it's similar that they're even got
the<00:03:50.229> little<00:03:50.380> earbud<00:03:51.359> pockets<00:03:52.359> but<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.840> there
