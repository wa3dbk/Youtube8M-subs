tricky<00:01:19.740> step<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.100> most<00:01:20.280> people<00:01:20.459> don't<00:01:20.609> know

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
tricky step that most people don't know

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.929 
tricky step that most people don't know
is<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.539> mango<00:01:21.869> pit<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:22.289> flat<00:01:22.649> and<00:01:22.939> wide

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
is that the mango pit is flat and wide

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940 
is that the mango pit is flat and wide
look<00:01:24.749> at<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.959> shape<00:01:25.109> of<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.350> mango<00:01:25.679> and<00:01:25.799> see

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
look at the shape of the mango and see

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
look at the shape of the mango and see
that<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.249> is<00:01:26.549> absolutely<00:01:26.999> the<00:01:27.240> widest<00:01:27.659> part

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that this is absolutely the widest part

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.019 
that this is absolutely the widest part
of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> mango<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.579> how<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.789> want<00:01:29.969> to

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:30.029 
of the mango so that's how you want to

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:31.429 
of the mango so that's how you want to
get<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.240> most<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.869> by<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.049> cutting

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
get the most out of it by just cutting

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.099 
get the most out of it by just cutting
it<00:01:31.679> right<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.130> half<00:01:32.179> I'll<00:01:33.179> demonstrate<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
it right in half I'll demonstrate that

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.949 
it right in half I'll demonstrate that
for<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.829> always<00:01:35.459> a<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:36.479> knife<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
for you now always a good knife is the

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.050 
for you now always a good knife is the
way<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.139> go<00:01:37.369> especially<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> talk<00:01:39.029> about

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
way to go especially when you talk about

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
way to go especially when you talk about
those<00:01:39.389> stringy<00:01:39.689> ones<00:01:39.959> so<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.679> cutting<00:01:40.889> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
those stringy ones so I'm cutting it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
those stringy ones so I'm cutting it
it's<00:01:41.399> pretty<00:01:41.999> much<00:01:42.179> right<00:01:42.569> where<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.959> was

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's pretty much right where I was

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.309 
it's pretty much right where I was
hanging<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.679> tree<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.429> go<00:01:44.549> next<00:01:44.729> that
