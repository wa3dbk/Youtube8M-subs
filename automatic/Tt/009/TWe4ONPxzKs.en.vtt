00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.189
 hello today tell you how 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:16.790
 to make a hookah to start 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:16.790
 we will disassemble the lock with a cup of a cup 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:32.029
 plates for every slag . 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.029
 and filter to start the night take the flask 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.620
 pour cold water 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:50.990
 water to the brim does not need something like that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.990
 15 cm neck was free 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.450
 so put on the filter 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.500
 our next action is tight 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.150
 fix the filter 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.490
 so that there are no gaps following our 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:12.440
 action take a cup 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:15.080
 for slag we put on and tight but 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.140
 slams the tobacco worker 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.360
 Doggie for half the case done further 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.570
 we take the tobacco choice here we have 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.780
 cherry 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:47.870
 but it is not so important I take only 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:53.630
 I teach we take an apple we take a pinch 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:58.980
 snuff and we lay down at that tower zu one thing 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.310
 too much tobacco should not be if 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.310
 too much tobacco then quickly 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.820
 burn through coal and we are not like a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 just brazenly hide smoke not at all 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.010
 the right smoke so we look to be 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.959
 gap between the foil but it's a little bit 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.280
 later and tobacco 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:36.150
 And yes, and a little more tobacco 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:39.470
 tamping is not much but then not 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.470
 in contact with the foil 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:01.060
 our further actions take foil in 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.060
 In this case, well, the usual foil for 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:18.220
 roasting in the oven tear off half 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:21.290
 so about a sheet of foil 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.130
 we doubled over some 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.200
 four but it seems to me not so much 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:34.540
 relevant in this case since 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 sneaks its flavor as it should 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:47.980
 tamping trade tamping 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.980
 so we put on a cup 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 after we pulled the cup 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.410
 foil 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.560
 we take a needle needle desirable to take 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.180
 not 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.489
 which makes small holes and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:34.480
 small as better less yes mi 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:36.900
 more holes pierce the foil to 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.120
 ask to notice 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:46.540
 the center should have more holes than 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:49.380
 on the sides otherwise will not need treatment 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.380
 thrust 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:10.329
 so after we made a hole 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:14.679
 we take take coal is better to take coal 

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:17.199
 certainly woody but in this case me 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:22.809
 take usually coal 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:25.539
 which just inflame so well for that 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:32.039
 pliers that will help us 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:33.909
 hookah now bring to the fire 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:38.709
 small enough 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:40.049
 contact with fire including hood so as not to 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:43.049
 need here 

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:43.049
 culprit 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:55.600
 and all in principle can be put on the foil 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:01.950
 so following our last actions we 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:04.020
 take the nipple and insert it into the hole 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.390
 over here 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.620
 tightly ask to notice tight should 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.940
 be here you can put tongs in order 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.510
 then periodically roll well and all 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.310
 valve valve for serves with us for 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.640
 air supply more less in order 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.770
 so that to begin with a normal hookah 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.270
 functioned better air at all 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.580
 remove overlap it 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.580
 and all smoke
