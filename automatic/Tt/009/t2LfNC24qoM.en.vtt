00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello dear friends now he later 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.970
 A new type that has developed which 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.130
 really works and works on 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.099
 any version of minecraft whether it's 151 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.719
 or 147 everything will work judging by 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.730
 is that we put some 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.289
 thing and this house is not only and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 plan drag and increases in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 sizes that is absolutely possible in any 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.830
 pay even diamond blocks with 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.019
 Using this type of conventional diamond and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 Now I will go and show you how 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.000
 in general, this design looks so 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.420
 look like this is worth it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.969
 from obsidian distributor of any wool 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.910
 absolutely diamond blocks well of course 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.700
 it is difficult here but will have to get them as well 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 worth dice of red torches and ration yet 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.950
 and the lever but the lava is sure to look 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.050
 by the way such an interesting feature that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 chapter in this in this construction on mine 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.699
 axial seed suicide in him will start it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 see him don't burn don't know why so 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.289
 occurs because such a construction 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.539
 It is worth as you can see for the distribution with us 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.780
 no one I said for the distributor with us 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.470
 there is no one and so everything is absolutely 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 honestly now show the very case 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.909
 what we need for this first 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 distributor we will need to lay a diamond 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.600
 or whatever you will copy be it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.890
 generally enchanted thing or absolutely 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 any thing to watch my jumped 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.580
 Be sure to jump once 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 back 180 degrees to the right all 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 so we activated the dispenser 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.540
 and we can run it using this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 leverage we run and there will need to be 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 Now a little time to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.869
 Distributor you earned and started 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.299
 plan things a little forward from everyone 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.759
 let's go see diamond blocks here 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.009
 they are in any amount, you can simply 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.930
 depending on how much you will stand behind it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.729
 deliverer and so on will clone 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.119
 be worth the whole day will be at all 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.430
 the richest myself as you can see i am not 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 will judge here stand just showed 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.939
 you yourself see the essence immediately sensor 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.840
 no one again i said at once 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.060
 sensor we have no one that's all honest 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 you can build it all yourself 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.550
 and it will all work and the essence of it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.630
 didn't say this tooth work only on 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.270
 one server 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.170
