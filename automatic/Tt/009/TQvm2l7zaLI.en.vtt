00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
move around however battery would be in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
move around however battery would be in
my<00:01:59.819> way<00:02:04.130> I'm<00:02:05.130> pretty<00:02:05.640> good<00:02:05.729> reason<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.560> pretty

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
my way I'm pretty good reason a pretty

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.260 
my way I'm pretty good reason a pretty
good<00:02:07.679> idea

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:51.660 

you<00:02:16.270> look

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.710 

it's<00:02:52.670> not<00:02:52.819> about<00:02:52.940> how<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.120> need<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.480> figure<00:02:53.630> out

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it's not about how I need to figure out

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's not about how I need to figure out
where<00:02:53.930> all<00:02:53.959> those<00:02:54.110> parts<00:02:54.440> go<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.730> ram<00:02:55.910> is

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
where all those parts go but the ram is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.490 
where all those parts go but the ram is
reconnected<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.310> doodad<00:02:58.700> I<00:03:02.260> can't<00:03:03.260> begin

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
reconnected to the doodad I can't begin

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.589 
reconnected to the doodad I can't begin
to<00:03:03.650> show<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.060> but<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.120> have<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.390> get<00:03:05.569> this

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
racket back so I can put the pin back in
