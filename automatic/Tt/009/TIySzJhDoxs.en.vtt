it<00:00:03.360> was<00:00:03.570> requested<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.290> make<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.830> on

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
it was requested that I make a video on

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.169 
it was requested that I make a video on
how<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.060> play<00:00:06.480> fits<00:00:07.610> fifths<00:00:08.610> are<00:00:08.760> actually

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
how you play fits fifths are actually

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.209 
how you play fits fifths are actually
what<00:00:09.360> our<00:00:09.480> instrument<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.929> tuned<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.980> if<00:00:11.099> I

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
what our instrument is tuned to but if I

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.810 
what our instrument is tuned to but if I
think<00:00:11.280> deep<00:00:12.120> up<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> that's<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.460> two<00:00:14.790> three

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
think deep up to a that's one two three

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.660 
think deep up to a that's one two three
four<00:00:15.480> five<00:00:16.320> notes<00:00:16.619> apart<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.220> count<00:00:17.490> your

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
four five notes apart you count your

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.540 
four five notes apart you count your
starting<00:00:18.029> note<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.330> one<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.039> that<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.250> called

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
starting note as one and that is called

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.880 
starting note as one and that is called
a<00:00:20.670> perfect<00:00:21.090> fifth<00:00:21.350> when<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> play

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a perfect fifth when you want to play

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689 
a perfect fifth when you want to play
them<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> double<00:00:23.939> stop<00:00:24.320> this<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:26.099> finger

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
them as a double stop this one finger

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
them as a double stop this one finger
covers<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.630> strings<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.260> known<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
covers two strings that is known as a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.850 
covers two strings that is known as a
fifth<00:00:32.070> okay<00:00:32.809> seems<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.380> simple

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
fifth okay seems like a really simple

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
fifth okay seems like a really simple
double<00:00:35.550> stop<00:00:35.730> deploy<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.600> only<00:00:36.719> use

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
double stop deploy because you only use

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:37.760 
double stop deploy because you only use
one<00:00:37.020> finger

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
one finger

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.729 
one finger
the<00:00:38.190> problem<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.020> fifth<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> an<00:00:40.320> interval

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the problem is a fifth is an interval

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.150 
the problem is a fifth is an interval
that<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.610> ring<00:00:42.050> absolutely<00:00:43.050> pure<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:44.010> it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that can ring absolutely pure when it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.860 
that can ring absolutely pure when it's
in<00:00:44.280> tune<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.570> our<00:00:46.260> fingertips<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:47.250> round<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in tune but our fingertips are round so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.770 
in tune but our fingertips are round so
when<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.200> cover<00:00:49.410> two<00:00:49.649> strings<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:51.090> hard<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
when we cover two strings it's hard to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.549 
when we cover two strings it's hard to
make<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> sound<00:00:53.059> absolutely<00:00:54.059> pure<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.320> come

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
make it sound absolutely pure if I come

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.750 
make it sound absolutely pure if I come
in<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> regular<00:00:56.780> finger<00:00:57.780> angle<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.550> push

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
in with a regular finger angle and push

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
in with a regular finger angle and push
down<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.329> strings<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.780> sometimes<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
down on two strings now sometimes it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.080 
down on two strings now sometimes it
happens<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> sounds<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.760> usually

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
happens that it sounds good but usually

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.429 
happens that it sounds good but usually
it's<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:04.019> smooth

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.649 

now<00:01:09.039> you<00:01:09.159> may<00:01:09.310> not<00:01:09.460> know<00:01:09.729> what<00:01:10.119> I'm<00:01:10.270> talking

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
now you may not know what I'm talking

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.719 
now you may not know what I'm talking
about<00:01:10.719> but<00:01:11.109> under<00:01:11.649> my<00:01:11.829> ear<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.130> can<00:01:12.429> hear<00:01:12.460> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
about but under my ear I can hear the

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.109 
about but under my ear I can hear the
tiniest<00:01:13.240> little<00:01:13.509> bit<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.899> flutter<00:01:14.700> created<00:01:15.700> by

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
tiniest little bit of flutter created by

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.719 
tiniest little bit of flutter created by
the<00:01:16.179> interaction<00:01:17.079> of<00:01:17.200> those<00:01:17.350> two<00:01:17.619> notes<00:01:17.890> by

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
the interaction of those two notes by

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.349 
the interaction of those two notes by
them<00:01:18.880> not<00:01:19.210> ringing<00:01:19.750> pure<00:01:20.109> so<00:01:21.069> you<00:01:21.759> want<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.179> get

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
them not ringing pure so you want to get

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.919 
them not ringing pure so you want to get
rid<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.659> that<00:01:22.929> flutter<00:01:23.789> okay<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.420> way<00:01:25.600> I

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
rid of that flutter okay so the way I

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.910 
rid of that flutter okay so the way I
was<00:01:26.350> taught<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.560> play<00:01:26.709> a<00:01:26.890> v<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.450> actually

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
was taught to play a v was to actually

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.819 
was taught to play a v was to actually
come<00:01:29.920> in<00:01:30.099> on<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.399> lower<00:01:30.579> string<00:01:31.060> on<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:32.469> left

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
come in on the lower string on the left

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.940 
come in on the lower string on the left
corner<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:34.119> finger<00:01:34.479> see<00:01:35.409> if<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.770> see

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
corner of the finger see if you can see

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.999 
corner of the finger see if you can see
the<00:01:36.099> thing<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.459> their<00:01:36.609> left<00:01:37.000> corner<00:01:37.599> and<00:01:38.009> then

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the thing on their left corner and then

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.410 
the thing on their left corner and then
also<00:01:39.989> to<00:01:40.989> flatten<00:01:41.679> the<00:01:41.890> angle<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.549> attack<00:01:42.819> here

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
also to flatten the angle of attack here

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.490 
also to flatten the angle of attack here
so<00:01:44.289> this<00:01:44.590> instead<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.429> this<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:47.079> you're<00:01:47.259> going

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
so this instead of this so you're going

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.389 
so this instead of this so you're going
to<00:01:47.530> be<00:01:47.770> very<00:01:48.039> shallow<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:53.049> makes<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:54.159> surface

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
to be very shallow it makes the surface

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.350 
to be very shallow it makes the surface
area

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
area

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.209 
area
I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:56.409> flatter<00:01:56.950> I'm<00:01:57.819> playing<00:01:58.329> more<00:01:59.289> on<00:01:59.439> the

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
I think flatter I'm playing more on the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.309 
I think flatter I'm playing more on the
pad<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:00.879> finger<00:02:01.270> than<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.539> fingertip<00:02:01.989> and

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
pad of the finger than the fingertip and

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.050 
pad of the finger than the fingertip and
it<00:02:02.709> gives<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.039> better<00:02:03.280> chance<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.849> actually

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
it gives you a better chance of actually

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.559 
it gives you a better chance of actually
playing<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.929> in<00:02:05.079> tune<00:02:05.319> I<00:02:05.590> also<00:02:06.369> balanced<00:02:06.939> my

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
playing this in tune I also balanced my

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.960 
playing this in tune I also balanced my
arm<00:02:07.810> position<00:02:08.379> say<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:08.979> want<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.340> play<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.819> D

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
arm position say I want to play on the D

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.360 
arm position say I want to play on the D
string<00:02:10.000> my<00:02:10.509> elbow<00:02:10.810> would<00:02:10.959> be<00:02:11.109> here<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:12.010> i<00:02:12.160> play

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
string my elbow would be here if i play

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.759 
string my elbow would be here if i play
on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.609> string<00:02:12.760> my<00:02:13.599> elbow<00:02:13.930> drops<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.650> little

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
on the a string my elbow drops a little

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.309 
on the a string my elbow drops a little
bit<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> here<00:02:15.690> that's<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> starting<00:02:17.139> balance

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
bit to here that's the starting balance

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.069 
bit to here that's the starting balance
I<00:02:17.620> want<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.400> balance<00:02:18.730> between<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.900> two

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
I want to balance between the two

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.530 
I want to balance between the two
strings<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:20.920> case<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:22.090> instead<00:02:22.480> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
strings so in this case so instead of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
strings so in this case so instead of
being<00:02:22.780> say<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> D<00:02:23.739> string<00:02:24.040> angle<00:02:24.400> instead<00:02:25.120> of

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
being say a D string angle instead of

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.020 
being say a D string angle instead of
being<00:02:25.389> an<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.569> string<00:02:25.810> angle<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:27.310> between<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
being an a string angle I'm between the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.319 
being an a string angle I'm between the
two<00:02:28.650> then<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.769> have<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.220> kissed<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.090> left

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
two then I have I kissed that left

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.110 
two then I have I kissed that left
corner<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.829> fingertip<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.790> come<00:02:34.000> in

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
corner of the fingertip and I come in

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.599 
corner of the fingertip and I come in
flatter<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.370> approach<00:02:36.880> not<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.329> pitch<00:02:38.609> and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
flatter the approach not the pitch and

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.809 
flatter the approach not the pitch and
it<00:02:39.790> should<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.090> nice<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.510> smooth<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.609> not

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
it should be nice and smooth if it's not

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.099 
it should be nice and smooth if it's not
totally<00:02:43.359> smooth<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.470> practice

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
totally smooth you have to practice

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.839 
totally smooth you have to practice
slight<00:02:47.109> different<00:02:47.680> different<00:02:48.220> combinations

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
slight different different combinations

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.240 
slight different different combinations
for<00:02:49.120> maybe<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.569> different<00:02:50.049> contact<00:02:50.950> point

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
for maybe a different contact point

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.940 
for maybe a different contact point
slightly<00:02:51.880> or<00:02:52.200> rotate<00:02:53.200> your<00:02:53.380> elbow<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.769> little

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
slightly or rotate your elbow a little

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.339 
slightly or rotate your elbow a little
bit<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.880> will<00:02:55.030> notice<00:02:55.389> immediately<00:02:55.510> if<00:02:56.230> I

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
bit you will notice immediately if I

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.720 
bit you will notice immediately if I
rotate

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880 

now<00:03:00.150> I'm<00:03:00.270> not<00:03:00.420> actually<00:03:00.629> changing<00:03:01.230> my<00:03:01.349> contact

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
now I'm not actually changing my contact

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
now I'm not actually changing my contact
point<00:03:02.099> I'm<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.310> rotating<00:03:02.849> my<00:03:03.390> elbow<00:03:03.690> did<00:03:03.900> you

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
point I'm just rotating my elbow did you

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.979 
point I'm just rotating my elbow did you
hear<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> pitch<00:03:04.440> go<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.099> down<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:05.970> all<00:03:06.690> of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
hear the pitch go up and down so all of

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.550 
hear the pitch go up and down so all of
those<00:03:07.140> things<00:03:07.410> come<00:03:07.650> into<00:03:07.830> play<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.840> fifth

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
those things come into play and a fifth

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.650 
those things come into play and a fifth
is<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> very<00:03:11.310> common<00:03:11.730> double<00:03:12.209> stop<00:03:12.420> you

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
is not a very common double stop you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.920 
is not a very common double stop you
don't<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.300> when<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
don't get it a lot but when you do it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.229 
don't get it a lot but when you do it
can<00:03:16.110> be<00:03:16.310> painfully<00:03:17.310> out<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.670> tune<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
can be painfully out of tune if you

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.150 
can be painfully out of tune if you
haven't<00:03:18.599> practiced<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.590> hopefully

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
haven't practiced this so hopefully

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699 
haven't practiced this so hopefully
those<00:03:20.670> little<00:03:21.030> tricks<00:03:21.239> will<00:03:21.480> help<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.870> find

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
those little tricks will help you find

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.269 
those little tricks will help you find
your<00:03:23.190> perfect<00:03:23.400> fit<00:03:23.730> good<00:03:24.090> luck
