00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.860
 attentive to this news because it is not the 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.270
 first time it happens is not the first 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.700
 once a title is cut out 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.740
 graphically we talk about the cut 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.700
 technician who has the pc version of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.460
 dead or alive 5 last round a cut 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.499
 graphic that has caused quite 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.839
 restlessness and good enough anger between 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.579
 the different pc users and 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.130
 obviously the truth is that they are right 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.839
 because you spend money on one in a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.819
 hardware for your pc so they look 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.579
 well the titles and if they then do this 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.830
 kind of thing because maybe you cabrees the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.840
 Japanese studies do not always try 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.480
 how they deserve jobs in pc 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.180
 We already know this well, because 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.380
 expected pc version should now live 5 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 the rom 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.660
 it's not going to be an exception to this the day 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.940
 March 30 we will finally see in the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 stores this title in its version for 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.290
 pc but with technical cuts that the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 truth is that they have pissed off many 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.670
 users the first official details 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
 they inform that I started we will not be able 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.720
 enjoy the show online and that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 we will have to settle for effects 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.950
 quality video from the previous cycle 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 May 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.880
 and the truth is that the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.189
 news not only that but the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.500
 requirements seem very disproportionate 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.750
 for those visual characteristics is 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.759
 say the game is not even going to be 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.360
 nothing optimized by very good pc that 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.429
 we have the pc it will cost to move it and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.549
 that they will not be around graphics 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.960
 say my mother as it seems good yes 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.929
 that we are going to enjoy the quality of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.020
 shadows in nexgen key but the physical ones 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.740
 and the effects are going to be from the previous 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.450
 graphic cycle online mode 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.310
 it will not be incorporated up to three months 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.500
 after the release of the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.840
 title I started the truth is that you are 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.539
 mistreating much users pepe 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.369
 with this game I sincerely believe that 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.439
 pepe users what they are not going to 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.619
 to do is to buy this dead or alive 5 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.569
 the roms how this really is true 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.569
 because I certainly would not
