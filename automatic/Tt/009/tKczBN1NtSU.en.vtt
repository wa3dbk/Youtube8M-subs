00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 hello all three days to all and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.080
 welcome for the very first video 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.879
 in this video I will show you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.290
 how to earn a lot of money 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.820
 this gran turismo so in fact it's very 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.049
 simple all you need to do is 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 do a lot of shopping 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.890
 the more we race, the more we win 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.010
 of money finally mostly make the most of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.010
 possible turns thanks to load 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 so at the microphone in the fist the circuit by 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 example I believe me it is more is 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.530
 simpler we will go back scramble 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.180
 everything and that's all so we turn in 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 round 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.850
 this circuit a car that you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.010
 think of you have won every time 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 I showed you that I hear more 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.730
 in fact of all I earn money because 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.730
 it's always looking 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:15.720
 this is what stands out 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:18.690
 and here you are, I see 277 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:26.810
 I ride pretty little happiness since I 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:29.280
 had to redeem nature so here is the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.649
 benjamin four feet as you can 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 see it there you go on the circuit 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.510
 you see 70 me 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 and that's like bruises did two 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:47.040
 maxim laps and won his zero pint 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:51.509
 this is me I put four rounds 3 to 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.890
 all that counts 1000 ok good then to the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.810
 point of a car in Nice 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.810
 admire me so we swim and pe 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.170
 I took the nissan option a dozen 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:12.750
 04 to show you still not the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 property 7 170 horses for that I'm sure 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.170
 to win 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.180
 Finally, I hope 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.080
 and here I put two rounds so we go 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.450
 do two rounds and so if in fact you 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.380
 do you think you want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.270
 earn more money there you are 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 deceived and well together but you it's 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.040
 a little it shows you that in fact you 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.680
 going to change by then we will the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.410
 two towers and be able to change though 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.230
 that it was going to look for a you got there 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.489
 if you change them that the engine of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.630
 everything about me I do not advise you 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.130
 of 99 passes anyway but we are a 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.620
 night ride already I'm starting to get excited 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.840
 bored adventures of peter 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.760
 there I put two won 50 miles 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.910
 it's not good enough when 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.670
 even 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 lamoriello car or rather their I 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.380
 won against it so a place less 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.380
 to regain I hope their approach 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.890
 on the other hand we go there 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.110
 yes if he called the companion for 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.440
 the moment so for now I win 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.480
 your double 1000 g and have cheated the saq 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.900
 had quite cut it all what 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.870
 that we do 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.370
 I 'm just going to fight those who are 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.800
 behind you there 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.550
 So here we intend to go around 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.550
 rotates in malmÃ¶ 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.240
 in oblivion it's really extremely 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.890
 simple we just have to move on and 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.020
 to smother the colors points win 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.110
 of money I had seen there for example if I 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.560
 doing Cattori 70 won here I am I 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.980
 does two rounds because that's when 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.300
 not even giannina if we are two minutes 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.959
 with this amateur affa all here is a 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.489
 minutes to dominate by dominique 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.750
 it's good there already it'll do 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:30.350
 technical castle makes a few minutes 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.880
 already dreamed of that now that I can 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.180
 not cut because if I cut made the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.169
 video development when I said I 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.730
 take not understood because in addition if 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.950
 I cut after life must not 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.300
 stop I do not take the continue 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.790
 I always had the input otherwise I'll 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.060
 cut that race I would have you but 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.060
 how 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:10.050
 portal is still my keyboard 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:16.590
 unique dates back to the year 2000 when I 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:19.100
 the two minutes 59.2 m 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.970
 no need for rotten loans that will be 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.950
 it's not nice the extreme forward 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:34.710
 ever it is still good that 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:36.720
 I thought that instead has tempered the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.250
 time to use the circuit totally 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.210
 zapped but I know everything but really 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.210
 that's all 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.280
 watch out if you like this video that 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.499
 I like if you do not like noted jean 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.389
 you will not be bored this is your 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:08.090
 choice added the president 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.610
 and so here is finally arriving 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.680
 because I had finished yet is that 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.499
 you resulted players I gave them 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.210
 this video 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:22.159
 so it's extremely dangerous said 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.240
 again it's super simple if there is no 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:29.090
 simpler than that no no no no no if a 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.039
 day I wanted to do 99 rounds but I 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.750
 think I stopped from 10 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.500
 because at some point you're fed up 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.210
 to do good tricks and tricks I you 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.150
 I really enjoyed it 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.460
 we know that I know him it's 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.659
 yet true that in fact it is you 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.960
 Yet working in false against 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.330
 these cabins of cars as much it will take 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.069
 change car because mom and 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.199
 more beginning I had taken his car to 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.400
 early I put them as before yes but 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.169
 at least I 'm turning 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.500
 they were they were starting their turn 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.039
 the rake entity of the century in the 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.120
 community 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.020
 so it was really the harvest of the 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.210
 century and so so you can then 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.289
 seeing that I won this race to send 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.550
 so they climbed in the good time 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.139
 after my tennis is here it is there it is 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.330
 there and seeing that I have not won yet 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.339
 rise of rank for this race a 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.180
 cottage or in the same car 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:21.199
 there we will spend the moment of the race 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.240
 do not wait 4 long time the wii sa 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.649
 paw 1030 miami the imminent you see 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.719
 there it continues to rise 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:29.960
 here are three hundred thousand three hundred thousand 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:31.969
 27 well we kill each other everything is over so 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.149
 I hope you liked it there the 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.149
 next
