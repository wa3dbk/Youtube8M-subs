00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in that game and I guess that could be a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
in that game and I guess that could be a
part<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> reason<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> why<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.869> chose<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
part of the reason as to why he chose to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.840 
part of the reason as to why he chose to
stay<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.189> game<00:01:20.479> after<00:01:21.479> suffering<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
stay in that game after suffering that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.539 
stay in that game after suffering that
you<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.970> elbow<00:01:24.830> laceration<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.100> whatever

you know elbow laceration or whatever

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
you know elbow laceration or whatever

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you want to call it and in retrospect ER

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.550 
you want to call it and in retrospect ER
that<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> was<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.759> bad<00:01:33.119> move

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
that that was a really really bad move

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.210 
that that was a really really bad move
that<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.869> was<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.799> medical

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that you know that was it the medical

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
that you know that was it the medical
staff<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.700> whatever<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> Warriors<00:01:39.720> they

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
staff or whatever for the Warriors they

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.700 
staff or whatever for the Warriors they
should<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.290> seen<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.280> deep<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.869> gash<00:01:43.350> was

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
should have seen how deep that gash was

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.440 
should have seen how deep that gash was
and<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.130> should<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.460> probably<00:01:44.820> taken<00:01:45.149> him

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and they should have probably taken him

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.649 
and they should have probably taken him
out<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:46.100> as<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
out of the game as it and they kind of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
out of the game as it and they kind of
just<00:01:48.720> wrapped<00:01:49.500> around<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:50.040> some<00:01:50.310> bandage

infected<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:07.380> infection<00:02:08.129> was<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.700> lot

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
infected now the infection was a lot

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.250 
infected now the infection was a lot
worse<00:02:10.200> than<00:02:10.649> anybody<00:02:11.489> could<00:02:11.819> have

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
worse than anybody could have

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.399 
worse than anybody could have
imagined<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.790> give<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.150> an<00:02:14.360> idea<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:14.930> how

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
imagined to give you an idea of just how

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.699 
imagined to give you an idea of just how
bad<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:19.159> elbow<00:02:19.640> infection

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
bad it really was this elbow infection

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.070 
bad it really was this elbow infection
almost<00:02:21.760> ended<00:02:22.760> David<00:02:23.150> Lee's<00:02:23.269> career<00:02:23.599> as<00:02:23.930> an

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
almost ended David Lee's career as an

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.009 
almost ended David Lee's career as an
NBA<00:02:24.349> player<00:02:25.180> yeah<00:02:26.180> that's<00:02:26.390> how<00:02:26.510> bad<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.900> was

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
NBA player yeah that's how bad it was

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.860 
NBA player yeah that's how bad it was
and<00:02:27.819> basically<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.060> reason<00:02:29.239> behind<00:02:29.450> that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and basically the reason behind that

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.650 
and basically the reason behind that
what<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.349> because<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.180> elbow<00:02:32.510> was

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
what is because you know the elbow was

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
what is because you know the elbow was
just<00:02:32.870> badly<00:02:33.590> infected<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.900> was<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.200> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
just badly infected and it was on the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.369 
just badly infected and it was on the
verge<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.650> just<00:02:36.860> spreading<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
verge of just spreading and the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.970 
verge of just spreading and the
antibiotics<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.530> whatever<00:02:39.650> they<00:02:39.920> were

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
antibiotics and whatever they were

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.100 
antibiotics and whatever they were
trying<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.670> wasn't<00:02:41.120> working<00:02:41.299> at<00:02:41.569> first<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
trying it wasn't working at first and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.559 
trying it wasn't working at first and
the<00:02:43.069> doctors<00:02:43.430> didn't<00:02:43.790> know<00:02:43.819> what<00:02:44.090> else<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.390> do

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
the doctors didn't know what else to do

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.750 
the doctors didn't know what else to do
and<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.019> needed<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.530> know<00:02:45.860> stop<00:02:46.579> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
and they needed to know stop the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.850 
and they needed to know stop the
infection<00:02:47.060> from<00:02:47.269> growing<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.739> know

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
infection from growing and you know

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.170 
infection from growing and you know
going<00:02:49.660> any<00:02:50.660> further<00:02:50.930> than<00:02:51.170> it<00:02:51.769> already<00:02:52.129> was<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
going any further than it already was so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.729 
going any further than it already was so
what<00:02:56.180> they<00:02:56.329> basically<00:02:56.750> went<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.140> told<00:02:57.470> them

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
what they basically went a told them

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.800 
what they basically went a told them
basically<00:02:58.730> what<00:02:58.970> they<00:02:59.090> told<00:02:59.359> them<00:02:59.599> was<00:02:59.900> if<00:03:01.810> if

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
basically what they told them was if if

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.780 
basically what they told them was if if
they<00:03:03.140> weren't<00:03:03.379> able<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.920> find<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.640> right

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
they weren't able to find the right

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.380 
they weren't able to find the right
combination<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.829> antibiotics<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:07.519> resolve

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
combination of antibiotics to resolve

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.190 
combination of antibiotics to resolve
this<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:09.019> cure<00:03:09.440> his<00:03:09.890> elbow<00:03:10.370> infection<00:03:11.200> they

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
this and cure his elbow infection they

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.180 
this and cure his elbow infection they
would<00:03:12.440> have<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.799> cut<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> slice<00:03:14.480> of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
would have to cut out like a slice of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.190 
would have to cut out like a slice of
David<00:03:16.190> Lee's<00:03:16.340> arm<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:19.450> prevent<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.660> prevent<00:03:21.079> an

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
David Lee's arm to prevent it prevent an

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.710 
David Lee's arm to prevent it prevent an
infection<00:03:21.620> from<00:03:21.799> further<00:03:22.220> growing<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:23.599> be

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
infection from further growing and to be

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.500 
infection from further growing and to be
more<00:03:23.989> exact<00:03:24.410> they<00:03:25.130> were<00:03:25.190> planning<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.180> cutting

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
more exact they were planning on cutting

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.479 
more exact they were planning on cutting
a<00:03:27.470> slice<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.190> his<00:03:28.690> tricep<00:03:29.690> off<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.430> is

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
a slice of his tricep off so and this is

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.890 
a slice of his tricep off so and this is
his<00:03:31.790> shooting<00:03:32.150> arm<00:03:32.359> that<00:03:32.599> we're<00:03:32.720> talking

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
his shooting arm that we're talking

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.830 
his shooting arm that we're talking
about<00:03:33.139> here<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:33.859> that's<00:03:34.609> why<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.720> know

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
about here so that's why you know

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.900 
about here so that's why you know
cutting<00:03:36.230> off<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.590> significant<00:03:37.400> muscle<00:03:37.579> like

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
cutting off a significant muscle like

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.400 
cutting off a significant muscle like
your<00:03:38.090> tricep<00:03:38.660> or<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.790> large<00:03:40.790> chunk<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.419> it<00:03:41.599> yeah

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
your tricep or a large chunk of it yeah

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.900 
your tricep or a large chunk of it yeah
I<00:03:42.650> could<00:03:42.919> see<00:03:43.099> how<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.280> would<00:03:43.519> have<00:03:43.760> ended

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
I could see how that would have ended

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.159 
I could see how that would have ended
Daly's<00:03:44.450> career<00:03:45.069> as<00:03:46.069> an<00:03:46.430> NBA<00:03:46.730> player<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.419> it's

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
Daly's career as an NBA player and it's

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.059 
Daly's career as an NBA player and it's
pretty<00:03:48.440> crazy<00:03:50.260> turned<00:03:51.260> out<00:03:51.440> they<00:03:51.769> were<00:03:51.829> able

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
pretty crazy turned out they were able

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.479 
pretty crazy turned out they were able
to<00:03:52.220> find<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.120> right<00:03:53.269> combinations<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.489> cure

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
to find the right combinations to cure

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.619 
to find the right combinations to cure
that<00:03:55.879> elbow<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.419> now<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.049> infection<00:03:57.799> is<00:03:58.010> gone

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
that elbow and now the infection is gone

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
he's been struggling pretty badly with

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.680 
he's been struggling pretty badly with
his<00:04:05.329> shots<00:04:05.599> as<00:04:05.840> he<00:04:05.959> came<00:04:06.139> back<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.599> you<00:04:08.599> know

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
his shots as he came back and you know

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.800 
his shots as he came back and you know
I've<00:04:09.169> been<00:04:09.410> critical<00:04:09.709> of<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.190> but<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.699> mean<00:04:11.419> at

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
I've been critical of it but I mean at

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.009 
I've been critical of it but I mean at
this<00:04:12.049> point<00:04:12.349> I<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:13.400> just<00:04:13.790> think<00:04:13.970> he's<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.629> warrior

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
this point I I just think he's a warrior

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.860 
this point I I just think he's a warrior
for<00:04:15.470> an<00:04:15.769> acyl<00:04:16.699> warrior<00:04:17.120> for<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.419> plaint

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
for an acyl warrior for a plaint

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.310 
for an acyl warrior for a plaint
the<00:04:17.989> roid<00:04:18.229> even<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the roid even and

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.140 
the roid even and
I<00:04:19.380> just<00:04:19.980> played<00:04:20.310> through<00:04:20.460> it<00:04:20.520> I<00:04:20.670> mean<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.880> could

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
I just played through it I mean I could

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.780 
I just played through it I mean I could
just<00:04:21.180> imagine<00:04:21.420> getting<00:04:22.100> hit<00:04:23.100> around<00:04:23.640> that

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
just imagine getting hit around that

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.170 
just imagine getting hit around that
area<00:04:24.060> every<00:04:24.600> time<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.200> game<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.090> it

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
area every time in a game and it just it

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.440
