compacts which that matter don't need to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
compacts which that matter don't need to
be<00:01:25.259> exactly<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.920> rough<00:01:26.189> estimates

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
be exactly just rough estimates

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
be exactly just rough estimates
something<00:01:27.509> close<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> get

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
something close to this is going to get

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
something close to this is going to get
you<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> general<00:01:29.880> area<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you in the general area I just kind of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
you in the general area I just kind of
make<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.439> exact<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> something<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
make it exact so you have something to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.760 
make it exact so you have something to
go<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.710> on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
go off of but as you can see it here on

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
go off of but as you can see it here on
the<00:01:34.890> killcam<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.610> gonna<00:01:35.700> bring<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> right

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the killcam it's gonna bring it right

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
the killcam it's gonna bring it right
down<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.600> their<00:01:36.780> spawn<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> roll<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
down into their spawn and roll all the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.030 
down into their spawn and roll all the
way<00:01:38.100> through<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.630> combat<00:01:40.200> axe<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> travel

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
way through the combat axe is travel

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
way through the combat axe is travel
further<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> Tomahawks<00:01:42.630> did<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.930> black

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
further then the Tomahawks did in black

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
further then the Tomahawks did in black
ops<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.159> makes<00:01:44.310> things<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.700> bit

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
ops so it makes things a little bit

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.030 
ops so it makes things a little bit
tricky<00:01:45.149> i<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.570> distances<00:01:46.140> down<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.920> we're

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
tricky i get my distances down so we're

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.550 
tricky i get my distances down so we're
going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:47.369> off<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.060> bomb<00:01:48.689> axes

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
going to start off with the bomb axes

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.620 
going to start off with the bomb axes
we're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> plant<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.549> off<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
we're going to plant here off of this

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.469 
we're going to plant here off of this
edge<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> bomb<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:53.700> i<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.299> my

you guys that's pretty cool so for the
second<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.480> we're<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> plant

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
second one for a we're going to plant

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.830 
second one for a we're going to plant
right<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.410> off<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.550> corner<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.120> this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
right here off of the corner of this

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.330 
right here off of the corner of this
bomb<00:02:55.140> site<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.970> plant<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.390> bomb<00:02:57.680> boom<00:02:58.680> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
bomb site as we plant the bomb boom and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.920 
bomb site as we plant the bomb boom and
then<00:02:59.580> put<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.760> shock<00:03:00.000> charges<00:03:00.360> down<00:03:00.510> right<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
then put your shock charges down right I

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.540 
then put your shock charges down right I
guess<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.260> could<00:03:01.380> use<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> tactical<00:03:02.220> insert

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
guess you could use a tactical insert

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.430 
guess you could use a tactical insert
but<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.120> destroy<00:03:03.720> those<00:03:03.930> things<00:03:04.230> from

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
but you can destroy those things from

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.290 
but you can destroy those things from
forever<00:03:04.739> away<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.280> they<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.489> hinder<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
forever away and they don't hinder the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
forever away and they don't hinder the
enemy<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.780> any<00:03:06.930> way<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.410> don't<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:08.070> them

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
enemy in any way so I don't like them

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.699 
enemy in any way so I don't like them
personally<00:03:08.790> anyway<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.840> watch<00:03:10.140> closely<00:03:10.350> where

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
personally anyway so watch closely where

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.870 
personally anyway so watch closely where

bottom above the white and then you see
the<00:03:19.350> shock<00:03:19.560> charge<00:03:19.769> goes<00:03:19.950> off<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.310> didn't<00:03:20.580> wait

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
the shock charge goes off I didn't wait

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
the shock charge goes off I didn't wait
a<00:03:20.790> second<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.420> should<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:22.380> them

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
with the second one and again it's
