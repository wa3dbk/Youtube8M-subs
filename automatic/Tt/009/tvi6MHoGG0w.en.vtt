00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
think it has something to do with the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.020 
think it has something to do with the
growth<00:02:47.739> hormones<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.489> chicken<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.910> beef

but<00:02:49.060> that's<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.660> my<00:02:49.870> opinion<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.440> back<00:02:50.709> to
