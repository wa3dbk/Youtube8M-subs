00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
right but when you turn to the back

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.559 
right but when you turn to the back
this<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.989> lower<00:02:30.170> cut<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:32.060> bottom

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
this is of a lower cut but that bottom

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.870 
this is of a lower cut but that bottom
of<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.989> dress<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.860> longer<00:02:34.310> cut<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
of the dress is of the longer cut and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.570 
of the dress is of the longer cut and
the<00:02:35.360> front<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.840> shorter<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.890> thought<00:02:37.400> it's

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
the front is shorter so I thought it's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.240

pretty like elegant and nice because

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.280 
pretty like elegant and nice because
it's<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> solid<00:02:49.310> color<00:02:49.549> one<00:02:50.000> piece<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.720> I
