00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 the beginning of the store a very small store 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.020
 was a store that was practically a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.090
 the runner had no refrigerators 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.440
 one freezer one refrigerator and two 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.440
 shelves and the store was that 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.960
 the option is the body's biggest problem 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 so people are not vegetarian and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.980
 they are not frivolous because they are not 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.000
 do you think so? 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.860
 there is not much choice and we with the store 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.809
 it was a hot morning really spoke 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.059
 for me and saw that it really was 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.520
 then knows our reference to that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.430
 vegan gringa market that has it all 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.589
 you might think it was sensational but 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.220
 Imagine if it was a store of 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.220
 curitiba 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.940
 we were there for that then from the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.890
 beginning of the store the idea is not only 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.340
 sell vegan vegetarian products to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.460
 store 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.170
 the idea was you sell something that is to see 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030
 day-to-day life of the person who 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.409

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.600

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.580
