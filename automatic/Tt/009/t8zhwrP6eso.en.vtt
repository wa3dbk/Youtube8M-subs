00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 collomb you amina hi to all this is 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.540
 damien and today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
 for two tests two of the test at this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
 test for two products from home like 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 nissan then the us from one of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.740
 lissouba then needs him to get tired and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.600
 mustard flavors from chaponnay geoffroy 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.890
 I am not god and the original 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.869
 japanese this one it seems he did 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.050
 not the same taste as the one we have here 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.700
 so we can add that right now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.690
 let's start with the preparation first 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:45.329
 youyou need then first of all we 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:49.680
 goes the driver like that it tells me he 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 have to control this little thing like 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:05.309
 this until half the small ones 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 hours alas too for low jumps 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.850
 so firstly we will pour 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.119
 water that's good of that firstly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 we put the water and the two small bags 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.060
 you will not see then we put water and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.320
 the two little bags in it we see 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 how do we want to do the reverse we're going 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.750
 put the two little bags in 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.510
 to this yardstick actually it's maybe 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 others 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:48.510
 mustard in any case it seems 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:51.690
 start I'll say more in the sun a 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.700
 only color is not soy sauce 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:02.970
 traditional but it is one that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 kind to like dairy like these is 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.860
 then we add 460 milliliters 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.090
 just Cottrez the dry aubiÃ¨re shot and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 then we close the positon 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:27.330
 calculation like these tech even small 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 trick to cook and we come back 10 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.610
 6 5 10 minutes to remove the water then 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.980
 here we are three minutes later 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.580
 now we will go to the stage of a 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.989
 bike for eating and sodas 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 then you remove the little cedrika 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.790
 feet there they all did it on purpose 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.640
 do you have a feather a species of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.640
 colander and so we remove 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:05.450
 that the hell this world just in ehpad 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 and actually brings back no but the 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.970
 remember what we come like that we get 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.970
 later found 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 so we are at the table this time 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.340
 here to enjoy the low fosso youyous 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 and orangina orangina we go 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.269
 to decapsulate then if you notice I 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.819
 do not know if you will see but the can 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.480
 is much smaller than others 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:42.090
 cans that I could have had 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.010
 she did it was not marked the number 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.049
 of centiliters that she does that must be 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.329
 a 25 centilitres 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.959
 we 'll pour into my little glass at 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.079
 mayor I had a manga glass 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:59.700
 it was one piece but unfortunately 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:04.739
 he broke it must be happy we come 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.799
 it's good like that it's more than 25 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.980
 km of more than 25 untitled 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.049
 and what will happen and yes 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.470
 so it's a 33 can 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.470
 cl 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.290
 in any case it smells like 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.190
 the orangina from home I will taste 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.190
 and shake said that 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.249
 good bah we're stubborn it's maybe a 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.019
 a little less sweet but I think it 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.159
 that it has the same taste in fact that 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:47.319
 the orangina from home so it's not 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.259
 I recommend you to take up 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.609
 take one to take back the can of 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.209
 at candie's anne like that you'll have a 

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:55.319
 little souvenir 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:58.719
 but if it's for the group you want 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.839
 you can not go buy it a 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:06.389
 bottle of orangina at home so 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.389
 now we go to the side of your phone 

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:19.899
 all the filling is glued verve we have 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:22.529
 have the water removed and we will mix 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.529
 all that 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.000
 talk 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.420
 and here we look a last shot 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.420
 above 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:55.470
 so that's what it gives to the end and 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.810
 I just read that I was wrong 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.660
 on a stage 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.750
 so how are you then 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.060
 to mourn properly actually 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.300
 you have to put the little bag 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.300
 grass with water first then 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:17.280
 you leave three minutes for it 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:19.800
 cook noodle and step number 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.840
 four actually you take away the water 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.480
 and then you remove more 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.670
 then you put the sauce sauce 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.710
 soy there that I told you it must not 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.290
 put it with water I have done this 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.790
 stupidity I did not read it so much 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.000
 worse for me we see how to taste 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.560
 I hope it will be a good taste I will 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.560
 say that right now 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.810
 it's quite delicious senou too 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.449
 strong or not enough 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.099
 but I think it's even better 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.659
 by putting the sauce at the right time 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.629
 Too bad for me you will be 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:11.710
 like that it's also what it's used for 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:15.379
