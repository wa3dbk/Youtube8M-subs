it one way over and over you keep the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.440 
it one way over and over you keep the
cost<00:00:21.840> down<00:00:22.400> now<00:00:23.400> even<00:00:24.120> though<00:00:24.270> you're

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
building a boat for less expense that
doesn't<00:00:26.640> mean<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.850> have<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.030> use<00:00:27.180> cheap<00:00:27.720> parts

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
doesn't mean you have to use cheap parts

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
compartment in the deck we can learn a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.590 
compartment in the deck we can learn a
lot<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.050> how<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.440> boat<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> built<00:01:08.510> when<00:01:09.510> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lot about how the boat is built when we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000 
lot about how the boat is built when we
take<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> hatch<00:01:10.080> off<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> first<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.890> we

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
take the hatch off the first thing we

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.950 
take the hatch off the first thing we
notice<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.730> not<00:01:11.910> hinged<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
notice is it's not hinged now that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
notice is it's not hinged now that
steves<00:01:13.200> won't<00:01:13.440> cost<00:01:13.620> but<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> makes<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
steves won't cost but it makes it a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.530 
steves won't cost but it makes it a
little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.730> hassle<00:01:14.910> to<00:01:15.120> deal<00:01:15.300> with<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
little bit of a hassle to deal with that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
little bit of a hassle to deal with that
hatch<00:01:15.720> once<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.710> inside<00:01:17.040> you're<00:01:17.310> going

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
hatch once you get inside you're going

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
hatch once you get inside you're going
to<00:01:17.490> notice<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.180> compartment<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.810> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to notice that the compartment is not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.400 
to notice that the compartment is not
lined<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:21.150> might<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.390> look<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.840> nice<00:01:22.110> but

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
lined now it might not look as nice but

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.800 
lined now it might not look as nice but
on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.010> upside<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.700> gain<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.540> inches

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
on the upside you gain about two inches

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
on the upside you gain about two inches
of<00:01:24.990> depth<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> compartment<00:01:25.830> by<00:01:26.100> not

of depth in this compartment by not

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
of depth in this compartment by not
lining<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.880> by<00:01:27.869> making<00:01:28.260> these<00:01:28.380> gunnels<00:01:28.800> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
lining it by making these gunnels so

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.010 
lining it by making these gunnels so
narrow<00:01:29.310> Bayliner<00:01:29.910> did<00:01:30.270> gain<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> space

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
narrow Bayliner did gain a lot of space

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
narrow Bayliner did gain a lot of space
in<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.260> boat<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.130> lose<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.550> ability<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
in the boat but you lose the ability to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
in the boat but you lose the ability to
put<00:01:33.270> stowage<00:01:33.630> compartments<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.290> there<00:01:34.500> now

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
put stowage compartments in there now

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
put stowage compartments in there now
they<00:01:35.550> made<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.150> putting<00:01:36.479> these

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
they made up for it by putting these

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080 
they made up for it by putting these
nifty<00:01:37.259> Nets<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.640> still<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.940> plenty

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
