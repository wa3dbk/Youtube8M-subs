00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
first because you can basically do those

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.980 
first because you can basically do those
quite<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.509> there<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
quite a bit more there we go a little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.440 
quite a bit more there we go a little
bit<00:02:07.170> more<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:16.319> should<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.709> enough<00:02:16.980> there's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
bit more that should be enough there's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.610 
bit more that should be enough there's
if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.629> can<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:19.019> it's<00:02:19.370> still<00:02:20.370> quite<00:02:20.640> chunky

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
if you can see it's still quite chunky

and when the black beans go we end on

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.539 
and when the black beans go we end on
the<00:02:24.329> other<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:25.440> ingredients<00:02:25.769> go<00:02:26.129> into<00:02:26.310> them

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
the other of ingredients go into them

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.860 
the other of ingredients go into them

into a paste some don't I don't I went

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:56.059 
into a paste some don't I don't I went
ahead<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.299> black<00:02:45.480> beans<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:55.069> there

ahead and put the black beans in there
we<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.599> see<00:02:57.599> where<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:59.750> breaking<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
we go see where it's breaking up the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.750 
we go see where it's breaking up the
beans<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.859> really<00:03:02.069> making<00:03:02.340> them<00:03:02.579> too

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
beans but not really making them too

beans but not really making them too
pasty<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:05.280> pulse<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.030> little<00:03:06.060> bit

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
pasty I just pulse it just a little bit

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.670 
pasty I just pulse it just a little bit
before<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.900> start<00:03:07.139> adding<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> other<00:03:07.739> stuff

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
next we'll put the bread crumbs I just

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.509 
next we'll put the bread crumbs I just
pour<00:03:15.419> them<00:03:15.480> right<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.810> there<00:03:16.280> I'm<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.459> to

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.290 
pour them right in there I'm going to
pulse<00:03:17.669> it<00:03:17.880> anyway

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.660 

one<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.420> my<00:03:24.650> green<00:03:25.650> machine<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.460> get<00:03:26.640> a

little<00:03:37.530> hand<00:03:37.890> mixing<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:38.640> because<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.180> not

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
little hand mixing here because it's not

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:49.610 
little hand mixing here because it's not
better<00:03:39.540> blend<00:03:39.870> real<00:03:40.140> will<00:03:48.230> now<00:03:49.230> that's<00:03:49.440> when<00:03:49.590> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
better blend real will now that's when I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.220 
better blend real will now that's when I
start<00:03:49.980> flipping<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.430> around<00:03:50.490> a<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:50.850> bit

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
start flipping it around a little bit

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.620 
start flipping it around a little bit
they<00:03:52.230> don't<00:03:52.410> want<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.650> take<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.860> blade<00:03:53.250> out

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630

too<00:03:58.500> much<00:03:58.530> now<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.400> see<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.760> pretty<00:03:59.970> dry<00:04:00.330> I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
too much now you see it's pretty dry I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.730 
too much now you see it's pretty dry I
don't<00:04:00.720> know<00:04:00.780> if<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.990> can<00:04:01.110> see<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.380> or<00:04:01.560> not

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
don't know if you can see it or not

don't know if you can see it or not
that's<00:04:02.610> pretty<00:04:02.760> dry<00:04:03.090> right<00:04:03.420> now<00:04:03.740> I'm<00:04:04.740> going<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that's pretty dry right now I'm going to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.370 
that's pretty dry right now I'm going to
probably<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.090> equivalent<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.870> two<00:04:07.200> egg

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
probably the equivalent of two egg

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.210 
probably the equivalent of two egg
whites<00:04:08.210> that<00:04:09.210> reach<00:04:09.420> over<00:04:09.780> here<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
whites that reach over here the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.030 
whites that reach over here the
equivalent<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.730> two<00:04:11.970> egg<00:04:12.150> whites<00:04:12.180> with<00:04:12.570> this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
equivalent of two egg whites with this

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.630 
equivalent of two egg whites with this
and<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:16.310> colored<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.870> yellow<00:04:18.870> color<00:04:19.640> so

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
and this is colored a yellow color so

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.140 
and this is colored a yellow color so
that<00:04:20.850> it<00:04:21.000> looks<00:04:21.660> like<00:04:22.400> egg<00:04:23.400> still<00:04:23.790> and<00:04:24.030> then

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
that it looks like egg still and then

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:51.080 
that it looks like egg still and then
binds<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.570> together<00:04:25.400> there<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.550> go

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.990 

there<00:04:52.090> we<00:04:52.210> go<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:53.260> that's<00:04:53.860> about<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.580> thick<00:04:54.820> as

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
there we go and that's about as thick as

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.850 
there we go and that's about as thick as

than<00:06:52.189> anything<00:06:52.580> else<00:06:52.759> and<00:06:53.090> because<00:06:53.360> of<00:06:53.509> the

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:53.629 
than anything else and because of the

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.089 
than anything else and because of the
flavoring<00:06:54.169> in<00:06:54.289> it<00:06:54.379> with<00:06:54.500> the<00:06:54.529> onion<00:06:54.979> and
