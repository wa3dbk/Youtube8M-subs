now<00:00:03.480> both<00:00:03.990> these<00:00:04.230> cars<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:05.040> very<00:00:05.430> clever

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
now both these cars have very clever

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.660 
now both these cars have very clever
all-wheel<00:00:06.750> drive<00:00:07.170> systems<00:00:07.710> or<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:07.950> least<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
all-wheel drive systems or at least the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.209 
all-wheel drive systems or at least the
manufacturers<00:00:09.510> say<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.380> devised<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
manufacturers say so I have devised a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.419 
manufacturers say so I have devised a
clever<00:00:11.929> handling<00:00:12.929> test<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.250> they

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
clever handling test to see how they

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.849 
clever handling test to see how they
perform<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.750> challenge<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.350> very<00:00:16.560> simple

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
perform so the challenge is very simple

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
perform so the challenge is very simple
I'm<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.730> drive<00:00:17.940> around<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.539> around

I'm going to drive around and around
this<00:00:19.350> dustbin<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.210> cars

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
this dustbin and so one of the cars

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
this dustbin and so one of the cars
under<00:00:21.930> steers<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> car<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.800> under<00:00:23.039> steers

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
under steers the car that under steers

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.450 
under steers the car that under steers
at<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> highest<00:00:24.150> speed<00:00:24.420> wins<00:00:27.769> or<00:00:28.769> until<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.279> get

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
sick so let's start in the rav4 here we

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.950 
sick so let's start in the rav4 here we
go<00:00:36.950> 2025<00:00:37.950> pulls<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> understeer<00:00:39.719> there

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
go 2025 pulls a bit of understeer there

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.110 
go 2025 pulls a bit of understeer there
but<00:00:40.800> 30<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:42.110> doing<00:00:43.110> quite<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.379> though

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
but 30 now doing quite well though

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.170 
but 30 now doing quite well though
moving<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.450> about<00:00:46.250> 14<00:00:47.250> still<00:00:47.640> no<00:00:47.850> real

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
moving up to about 14 still no real

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
moving up to about 14 still no real
understeer<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.230> keep<00:00:49.469> going

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
understeer I'm gonna keep going

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.029 
understeer I'm gonna keep going
that's<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.300> funny<00:00:51.690> though<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that's so funny though can we get it to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's so funny though can we get it to
40<00:00:53.430> without<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.420> understood

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
40 without really understood

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
40 without really understood
oh<00:00:55.440> no<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.270> go

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
oh no I think that that there we go

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.160 
oh no I think that that there we go
alright<00:00:57.780> let<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.649> 30<00:00:59.399> case<00:01:00.210> buffer

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.350 

so<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> Toyota<00:01:04.710> rav4<00:01:04.920> man<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.000> 30

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so the Toyota rav4 man is just about 30

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.660 
so the Toyota rav4 man is just about 30

I'm<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:57.320> not<00:01:57.620> expect<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.220> we're<00:01:58.460> at<00:01:58.550> about<00:01:58.640> 30

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
I'm to not expect that we're at about 30

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.130 
I'm to not expect that we're at about 30
now<00:01:59.210> their<00:01:59.420> strikes<00:01:59.720> when<00:01:59.960> there's

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
now their strikes when there's

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.830 
now their strikes when there's
understeer<00:02:00.830> so<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.820> basically<00:02:02.180> exactly<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
understeer so it's basically exactly the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.510 
understeer so it's basically exactly the
singles<00:02:03.200> left<00:02:03.320> 30<00:02:03.590> carries<00:02:03.890> our<00:02:05.170> quest<00:02:06.520> with

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
the round forward it is I'm kind of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.650 
the round forward it is I'm kind of
expecting<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.490> shine<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> pretty

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
expecting it to shine have the pretty

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.260 
expecting it to shine have the pretty
much<00:02:11.930> performed<00:02:12.500> exactly<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.670> wrap<00:02:13.940> for<00:02:14.150> one
