00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:11.430
 a whole piece of meat tastes and chic it 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:15.200
 just a piece of meat it is just a dummy in 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.200
 I have no words awesome this is chic 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:29.160
 we take the second bank would be a little bit 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.840
 hot and but if you noticed 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.030
 I turned over there too with that 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.180
 the sides are a little hot let's go right away 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.049
 this fat is all skinny bush i 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:50.819
 for some reason I feel that there will also be 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:57.810
 a piece of meat to lie here I am excess Roger 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:04:00.680
 let's take it all down and meat among 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.680
 whole pieces of meat 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.180
 but here it is canned food 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.130
 it will be more salty which means of course 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.960
 here, too, whole pieces of meat I want and 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.710
 railing and believe me if was just 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.080
 piece of meat 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:24.220
 but there are a lot of fat, that is , 300 would 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:26.040
 pay attention here this this here this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 everything is filled with fat on the contrary 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.550
 1 canned meat is pure meat 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.820
 canned food is very tasty first though 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:43.300
 slightly saltier than a helmet from this 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:45.940
 even i'm on a level now that tastes 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.710
 more tender that's more salty on 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.960
 the taste is otherwise completely identical 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.930
 well and of course here in less fat here 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.940
 here is more fat here already 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:01.000
 there is only some water in which was brewed 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.150
 meat so that it seems to me now though 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.280
 one thing and the other is mikoyana here it somehow 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.850
 better than better stew just 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.130
