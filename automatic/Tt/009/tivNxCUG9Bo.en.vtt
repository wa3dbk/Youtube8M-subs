00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.190
 m 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
 and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.070
 good 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.039
 we 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.579
 not especially because he had 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.110
 been defeated in thomas brion and that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 had thought at that moment that he was 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.910
 maybe not the horse we thought 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.820
 and he rehabilitated himself by winning the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 list sent to St. Cloud to three years 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 a choice that can the resistances of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.409
 fortis to i will logically yes 2400 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 meters it's possible it's a foal 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.430
 who is very cold who is very very 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.280
 handy that can go in all 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 good terrain then it's often it's 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 discreet training in the morning so 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 this year we do not have lines that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.100
 are very very safe so that's enough 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 difficult to know 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.550
 unlike some years we 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 really happens on a jockey club where we 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.149
 really has no landmarks of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 three years to each other 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.610
 so we do not really know how things are 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.850
 it will take shape 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 I 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.510
 g 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.510
 they love each other 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.470
 we 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 today the end he is working on 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.920
 again it's a cold horse 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.290
 that they are working now and the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 hand recovery and then he will live 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.670
 sure is in the earth until Sunday 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.550
 he ran to two years and the agreement still 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.030
 had three times two years and that makes it a 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.880
 difference 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 and this year, on the contrary, we have 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.020
 ran twice he ran twice in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.300
 doing things easily so 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.340
 no i think it's enough is enough 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.650
 of maturity to give the best of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 himself 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.260
 it's not a big holy phalle horse 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 very very harmonious physically who 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.480
 is not very big but quiquet that has 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.590
 a good locomotion that is very flexible 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.270
 that a very good back is why they 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.900
 adapt as well to heavy ground 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.900
 the field 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.980
 he
