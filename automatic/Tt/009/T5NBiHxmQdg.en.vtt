00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
thought it would get like sort of a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.130 
thought it would get like sort of a
shocked<00:00:16.529> reaction<00:00:17.220> because<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.990> I

that what you're saying I don't have

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.900 
that what you're saying I don't have
time<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.579> bleed<00:03:26.879> I<00:03:27.239> was<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.199> governor<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:29.129> fighter

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
time to bleed I was a governor a fighter

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.550 
time to bleed I was a governor a fighter
a<00:03:30.329> Navy<00:03:30.900> SEAL<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> model<00:03:33.870> for<00:03:34.169> the<00:03:34.290> dollar

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
a Navy SEAL the I model for the dollar

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
a Navy SEAL the I model for the dollar
bill<00:03:35.329> that<00:03:36.329> was<00:03:36.599> me<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.329> what<00:03:39.510> else<00:03:39.690> happened

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
bill that was me so what else happened

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:49.309 
bill that was me so what else happened
what<00:03:40.680> was<00:03:40.889> tied<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.790> UPS<00:03:44.419> it<00:03:45.419> um<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.109> I

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
what was tied in to UPS it um it was I

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.990 
what was tied in to UPS it um it was I
think<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.680> was<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:49.980> probably<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.669> driver

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
think it was just probably one driver

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.780 
think it was just probably one driver
but<00:03:51.389> it's<00:03:51.919> basically<00:03:52.919> there<00:03:53.250> was<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> hacking

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
but it's basically there was a hacking

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.780 
but it's basically there was a hacking
organization<00:03:54.540> a<00:03:54.629> hacking<00:03:55.169> organization<00:03:56.010> did

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
organization a hacking organization did

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.599
