00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the javafx SDK setup which I don't

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.290 
the javafx SDK setup which I don't
really<00:02:45.920> want<00:02:46.250> right<00:02:46.460> now<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:46.850> i'll<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.000> click

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
installer will do now is launched a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
installer will do now is launched a
product<00:02:56.180> registration<00:02:56.870> page<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:58.850> used<00:02:59.120> to

product registration page and if used to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.200 
product registration page and if used to
register<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.630> just<00:03:00.050> go<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.220> page<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> but

register it just go to that page and but
I<00:03:02.240> don't<00:03:02.510> want<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.960> just<00:03:03.170> closed<00:03:03.410> it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I don't want to so I just closed it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
I don't want to so I just closed it
right<00:03:04.010> now<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.220> let's<00:03:07.700> launch<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.330> command

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
right now so let's launch the command

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.480 
right now so let's launch the command
window<00:03:08.840> right<00:03:09.170> now

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.210 

now<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.750> development<00:03:16.170> work<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.710> need<00:03:16.860> two

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
now to do development work we need two

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.930 
now to do development work we need two
programs<00:03:18.090> most<00:03:18.690> importantly<00:03:19.230> which<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.940> which

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
programs most importantly which is which

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.020 
programs most importantly which is which
are<00:03:21.120> Java<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.050> Java<00:03:22.350> Sea<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.520> let's<00:03:23.730> check<00:03:23.910> if

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
are Java and Java Sea so let's check if

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.730 
are Java and Java Sea so let's check if
both<00:03:24.300> of<00:03:24.330> them<00:03:24.480> are<00:03:24.810> installed<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> middle

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
both of them are installed in the middle

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.950 
both of them are installed in the middle
billet<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.220> us<00:03:26.370> from<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.450> command<00:03:27.690> line<00:03:32.780> if<00:03:33.780> I

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
billet to us from the command line if I

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.020 
billet to us from the command line if I
just<00:03:34.320> call<00:03:34.530> Java<00:03:34.890> Sea<00:03:35.070> we'll<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.520> invoke<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
just call Java Sea we'll just invoke the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.120 
just call Java Sea we'll just invoke the
Java<00:03:36.480> compiler<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.470> compiler<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
Java compiler the compiler is the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.040 
Java compiler the compiler is the
program<00:03:38.280> which<00:03:38.580> will<00:03:38.730> use<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.180> come<00:03:39.360> by<00:03:39.750> our

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
program which will use to come by our

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.220 
program which will use to come by our
Java<00:03:40.440> programs<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.010> bytecode<00:03:41.780> but<00:03:42.780> i'll<00:03:43.020> call

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
Java programs to bytecode but i'll call

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.110 
Java programs to bytecode but i'll call
the<00:03:43.410> dash<00:03:43.620> version<00:03:44.010> i'll<00:03:44.520> use<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> dash

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the dash version i'll use the dash

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.250 
the dash version i'll use the dash
version<00:03:45.420> switch<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.590> will<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.010> give<00:03:47.340> me

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
version switch which will just give me

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.560 
version switch which will just give me
the<00:03:49.260> version<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.980> Java<00:03:50.370> Sea<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.790> if<00:03:51.270> it<00:03:51.390> gives

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
the version of Java Sea and if it gives

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.000 
the version of Java Sea and if it gives
me<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.750> diversion<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.230> Java<00:03:52.500> see<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.860> will

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
me the diversion of Java see it will

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.380 
me the diversion of Java see it will
mean<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.460> is<00:03:53.580> installed<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.440> click

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
mean that it is installed so I click

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.880 
mean that it is installed so I click
enter<00:03:57.390> but<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.870> says<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.260> Java<00:03:58.470> Sea<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.710> not

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
enter but it says the Java Sea is not

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.410 
enter but it says the Java Sea is not
recognized<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.490> an<00:03:59.610> internal<00:03:59.940> external<00:04:00.120> come

recognized as an internal external come
on<00:04:00.650> now<00:04:01.650> let's<00:04:01.830> do<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> same<00:04:02.370> thing<00:04:02.640> for<00:04:02.910> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
on now let's do the same thing for the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.680 
on now let's do the same thing for the
Java<00:04:03.480> come<00:04:03.750> on<00:04:03.870> as<00:04:04.020> well<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.910> Java<00:04:06.150> come<00:04:06.360> on<00:04:06.480> is

there are many applications now these
are<00:06:04.150> very<00:06:04.300> critical<00:06:04.480> applications<00:06:05.169> that<00:06:05.380> will

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
are very critical applications that will

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.830 
are very critical applications that will
be<00:06:05.830> using<00:06:06.700> during<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:08.430> course<00:06:09.430> of<00:06:09.550> our

be using during the course of our
training<00:06:10.840> over<00:06:11.200> here<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.520> as<00:06:13.480> you<00:06:13.600> can<00:06:13.750> see

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
training over here so as you can see

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.909 
training over here so as you can see
that<00:06:14.080> there<00:06:14.230> are<00:06:14.260> many<00:06:14.470> but<00:06:14.650> we<00:06:14.800> are

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
that there are many but we are

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.430 
that there are many but we are
interested<00:06:15.310> in<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.870> java<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:17.140> correctly

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
interested in to java is correctly

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.110 
interested in to java is correctly
configured<00:06:17.680> here's<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.370> java<00:06:18.580> program<00:06:18.970> that

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
configured here's the java program that

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.880 
configured here's the java program that
we<00:06:19.300> were<00:06:19.660> calling<00:06:19.930> from<00:06:20.200> the<00:06:20.320> command<00:06:20.590> line<00:06:20.620> as

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
we were calling from the command line as

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.409 
we were calling from the command line as
you<00:06:21.460> can<00:06:21.550> see<00:06:21.700> it<00:06:21.820> is<00:06:21.910> correctly<00:06:22.210> configured

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
you can see it is correctly configured

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.780 
you can see it is correctly configured
but<00:06:22.930> we<00:06:23.590> want<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.830> configure<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.400> Java<00:06:24.610> Sea

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
but we want to configure the Java Sea

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.060

here close this window and let's check
if<00:07:06.310> we<00:07:06.490> have<00:07:06.540> Java<00:07:07.540> installed<00:07:08.520> it<00:07:09.520> still<00:07:09.790> says

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
if we have Java installed it still says

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.490 
if we have Java installed it still says
that<00:07:10.210> it<00:07:10.420> cannot<00:07:10.690> recognize<00:07:11.200> that<00:07:11.380> command

that it cannot recognize that command

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.980 
that it cannot recognize that command
but<00:07:12.100> all<00:07:12.340> we<00:07:12.550> need<00:07:12.700> to<00:07:12.730> do<00:07:13.000> is<00:07:13.210> just<00:07:13.240> restart

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
but all we need to do is just restart
