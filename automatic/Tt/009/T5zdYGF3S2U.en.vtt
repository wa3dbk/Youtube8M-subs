00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
menus okay I kind of like the way that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270 
menus okay I kind of like the way that
this<00:00:35.640> looks<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> Mac<00:00:37.500> quite<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> bit

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this looks on the on the Mac quite a bit

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
this looks on the on the Mac quite a bit
because<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:39.239> shows<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.899> better

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because it shows you a little bit better

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.600 
because it shows you a little bit better
you've<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.620> different<00:00:40.950> options<00:00:41.370> like

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you've got these different options like

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.330 
you've got these different options like
I<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:41.879> push<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> cover<00:00:42.450> type<00:00:42.719> ones<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.410> click

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
I want push and cover type ones i click

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.740 
I want push and cover type ones i click
on<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> it'll<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:45.829> preview<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.250> me

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
on it it'll actually preview it for me

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.180 
on it it'll actually preview it for me
now<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> things<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:50.010> these

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
now the one of the things about these

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
now the one of the things about these
little<00:00:50.660> transitions<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> select

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
little transitions is and if I select

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.220 
little transitions is and if I select
one<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:55.160> applying<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
one it's actually applying that

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
one it's actually applying that
transition<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.530> specific<00:00:58.829> slide<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.850> have

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
transition to that specific slide I have

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.970 
transition to that specific slide I have
more<00:01:00.210> pages<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.780> those<00:01:00.899> kinds<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> slides<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
more pages of those kinds of slides I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 
more pages of those kinds of slides I
have<00:01:02.370> 3d<00:01:02.879> options<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.739> wild

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
have 3d options some kind of pretty wild

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.969 
have 3d options some kind of pretty wild
and<00:01:05.250> crazy<00:01:05.489> ones<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.530> any<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.890> these

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and crazy ones and I can do any of these

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.929 
and crazy ones and I can do any of these
that<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> options<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that I want but this options what it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
that I want but this options what it's
doing<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.390> applying<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.930> transition

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doing is it's applying that transition

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
doing is it's applying that transition
to<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> specific<00:01:14.310> slide<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> only<00:01:15.570> slide

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to that specific slide so the only slide

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
to that specific slide so the only slide
that<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.020> change<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that would change that way is that one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.460 
that would change that way is that one
so<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> comes<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.689> slide<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so as it comes to that slide that's the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
so as it comes to that slide that's the
effect<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> would<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.150> click

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
effect that it would use but if I click

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
effect that it would use but if I click
on<00:01:21.540> options<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.340> more

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
on options actually have some more

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
on options actually have some more
things<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:26.189> choose<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
things that I can do I can choose that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
things that I can do I can choose that
cube<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.210> actually<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> choose

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
cube up I'm actually going to choose

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.940 
cube up I'm actually going to choose
cube<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.400> prefer<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.710> keep<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> on

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
cube down I prefer that one keep it on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.520 
cube down I prefer that one keep it on
fast<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
fast and this is the one thing that I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
fast and this is the one thing that I
like<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.280> create<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> sound<00:01:35.880> it's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like to is I can create a sound it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.770 
like to is I can create a sound it's
pretty<00:01:36.869> effective<00:01:37.369> typically<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.700> music<00:01:39.540> click

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
pretty effective typically I music click

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.520 
pretty effective typically I music click
because<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> pretty<00:01:40.409> subtle<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.360> but

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
because it's a pretty subtle one but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
because it's a pretty subtle one but
it's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.649> pretty<00:01:43.770> effective<00:01:43.950> tool<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.939> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it's a pretty effective tool that as you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's a pretty effective tool that as you
change<00:01:45.270> slides<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> changing

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
change slides your kind of changing

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.370 
change slides your kind of changing
topics<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.399> apply<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> sound<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> gives

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
topics to apply a sound so that gives

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
topics to apply a sound so that gives
another<00:01:49.590> clue<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> participants<00:01:51.090> for

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
another clue to the participants for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
another clue to the participants for
these<00:01:51.600> students<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.710> changing<00:01:52.890> what

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
these students that you're changing what

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
these students that you're changing what
you're<00:01:53.280> doing<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> sound<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.720> I'm
