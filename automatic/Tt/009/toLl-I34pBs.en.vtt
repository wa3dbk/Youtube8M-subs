00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I often wonder what kind of image 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.109
 I can give of myself in my videos 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 people say we're always pissed off 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.929
 and always ready to complain about 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 anything when in reality not 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 understand that what I do is nothing else 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 that make constructive criticism 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 if in my opinion that aspect of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 the work is not worthy of the critic 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.119
 but not for this I think of the work 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.130
 I suck 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.000
 clarified this let's talk about that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.000
 crap of fraud 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.840
 I will be particularly bad at this 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.460
 review machines from why they are 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.320
 was very disappointed by this 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.360
 feature film and I think he tries 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.470
 expectations have been fundamental 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.310
 that was created for me 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.440
 I saw sentence is not enough 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.370
 recently then a few years later 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.780
 its release 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.490
 and in all this time he received a 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.290
 media bombardment on 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.390
 expectations I had to create for this 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.740
 film is a masterpiece of two 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.260
 oscar awards for the best song 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.239
 best animated feature film then 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.619
 I have to say I was expecting great things is 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.450
 as if your friend were coming to you 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.160
 say next Saturday I will take you to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.560
 eat the world's best restaurant 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.210
 you expect the whole week counting 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.100
 days arrive ahead to fight with 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.750
 the mouth watering and four bodies yes 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 find yourself in a small with a waiter 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.619
 hairy the more families are cleaned with 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.060
 knives while you prepare and that you 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.300
 serves a regional pasta dish 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.710
 microwave couple maybe it's good is not 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.900
 just what awaits you goes away 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 here in this brilliant sentence metaphor 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.860
 it was the filthy waiter's fingernails 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.570
 hairy but let's go to order let's say 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 what's wrong with this carton 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.820
 first of all the songs I can tell you there 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.460
 truth to me the film of the disney me 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.170
 always been on balls not for stories 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.509
 not for the characters that there anyway 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.520
 I grew up together too 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.130
 most of you have looked at dozens of 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.039
 sometimes disney cartoons but for the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.690
 songs I never endured the fact 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.700
 that at some point in history e 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.250
 characters start singing like that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.350
 casually is that no one ever notices the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.330
 what this thing sends me out of my mind 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.280
 because if one starts singing in 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.530
 middle of the road to the slightest thing 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.970
 happens to be interned instead no 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.160
 the creatures between disney and how much more 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.720
 normal there is but I usually do a 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.880
 good face to play because 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.220
 songs in disney movies have a 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.140
 meaning are used to make people spend 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.930
 time to tackle the issue 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 particularly important premium and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.140
 lion for example 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.930
 the lion king songs have a 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.060
 meaning some but given for example a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.630
 various meanings introduce for sal gy 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.400
 timon and pumbaa serves as a time frame 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.060
 from childhood to the duration phase of simba 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.280
 and serves to dilute the situation 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.370
 after the death of mou false or even la 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.650
 scale song serves to illustrate the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.020
 character that precisely and scale and his 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.540
 plan for my father's death in 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.610
 frozen or messages sing continuously 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.220
 instead of talking if there weren't any 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.890
 frozen songs the creator two LEDs 40 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 minutes and would have the same value because 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.250
 you find yourself looking at a cardboard vi 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.560
 you will realize when to phrase that in 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.930
 first 25 minutes of films 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.210
 you will have heard five songs five 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 songs of the first 25 minutes film wants 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.610
 say to hear yes and no three spoken sentences 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 do not sing and sincerely there are 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.120
 more direct and less painful methods for 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.890
 break our balls rather than 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:30.360
 watch a movie whose card characters from 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:30.360
 continuously but you are sure 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.390
 fortunately more the film goes on more 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 the songs thin out more or less and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.490
 so in ways to savor the cornucopia 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.040
 of crap that are the characters of 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.710
 frozen let's talk about the protagonists elsa 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.320
 and anna elsa and the princess who is in 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.660
 able to create and give life to ice 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.690
 a power that is destabilized by the 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.030
 his feelings and strengthens when he has 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.380
 fear or when he finds anger on the other 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.020
 part there is anna the princess 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.000
 pain in the ass whose purpose is to 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.790
 piss off her and get her into trouble 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.850
 pearl and then which of the two will be the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.680
 protagonist of the most exact holy anna 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.780
 but not only other characters do not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.640
 are even less the thickness of a 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.310
 teaspoon so I don't talk about it 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.140
 of at least christophe is a mountaineer who 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.620
 has fetish for reindeer and for 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.890
 ice 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.810
 now I ask a person with love for love 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.990
 ice fetish 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.810
 will fall in love with arnad came the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.980
 pen is the spit copy of maximus of 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.930
 rapunzel hurt and then now olaf 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.630
 I think it's the most wise one 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.090
 overrated the entire series before 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.340
 to see film I had seen series dg 7 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.300
 of majin jet that went crazy for this 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.250
 snowman 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.710
 some instead of being who he had given 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.240
 life and therefore like on the cardboard too 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.280
 ground have created the choices I 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.350
 expectations that have been betrayed into 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.150
 full a character with the charisma of 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.250
 grandma's fat duck that makes jokes 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.650
 they wouldn't make kids three years old laugh 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.380
 and whose sole purpose is to 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.580
 reiterate the obvious and that is essential 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.570
 because the other essays are gods 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.160
 deficient 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.990
 congratulations for the characterization of 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.870
 characters but all this 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.270
 music and characters and nothing in 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.300
 I don't know how it can compare to history 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.280
 genuinely frozen pleasure the story is 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.039
 so trivial 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.289
 obvious so stupid that anyone 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.389
 watch the first five minutes of film 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.250
 would understand how it would end and 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.050
 but apparently not the masterpiece e 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.690
 I ca n't fault the whole story of 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.580
 sentence for two reasons the first reason is 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.460
 that would take me this too long 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.740
 video should 40 minutes because full of 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.509
 silly parts this film is the second 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.800
 reason is that I do not have the powerful means of 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.539
 youtube and then but one would come 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.060
 subpoena before 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.669
 turn off the camera but to turn it on 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.490
 taste of frozen let's see what happens 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.960
 in the first thirty minutes of a movie he raises for 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.520
 mistake hits his head with his 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.020
 magic is the only way to save that 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.580
 to lead to detroit who say it is 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.380
 a fortune that was hit at 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.789
 head and not to the heart not the heart which 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.300
 norm away from the eyes away from the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.000
 heart 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.349
 who knows where it will hit next time 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.150
 the only way to save anna e 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.130
 remove magic and all memories 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.870
 of the magic of his head and for 12 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.849
 years anna was ignored by enza more 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.800
 he just wants to protect her only then 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:21.449
 when anna discovers the magic of 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.449
 sister absolutely nothing happens 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.240
 anna acquaintances after five minutes 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.800
 decide to marry elsa obviously 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.449
 says no and came with written will be 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.430
 easy is hunted like a monster by 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.050
 everyone from the castle Anna followed her alone 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.130
 none of the guards decides to escort 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.580
 the princess on a mission 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:40.990
 potentially fatal ex five minutes 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.759
 after dodging the lynching 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.460
 public and have lost all paper 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.139
 happy and satisfied 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.520
 anna in counts christopher although the 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.909
 companion in a suicide mission in 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.860
 change of 2 carrots and an anna hammer 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.099
 finds elsa is the sun is wrong hits at 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.099
 heart 

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:00.699
 christophe I take it inside what they say 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.599
 that the only way to save that of a 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.340
 act of true love 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.719
 so anna returns to caster dams that yes 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.550
 turns out to be an asshole and doesn't love 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:08.440
 really thanks to the great help of olof 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.090
 she actually understands its true 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.810
 love is not a chick she's known for 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.580
 5 minutes 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.740
