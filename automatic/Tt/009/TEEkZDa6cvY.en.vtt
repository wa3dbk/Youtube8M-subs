00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
processor we are going to add in all of

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.460 
processor we are going to add in all of
the<00:03:04.370> ingredients<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.390> filling<00:03:05.420> how<00:03:06.110> easy

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
the ingredients for the filling how easy

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.410 
the ingredients for the filling how easy
is<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:06.769> no<00:03:07.670> steps<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:09.079> all<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:09.860> go

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
is that no steps just all in one go

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.930 
is that no steps just all in one go
super<00:03:11.420> easy<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.810> simple<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.400> certainly

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
super easy and simple you can certainly

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.699 
super easy and simple you can certainly
do<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.359> part<00:03:14.630> by<00:03:14.750> hand<00:03:15.019> but<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.290> find<00:03:15.590> that

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
do this part by hand but I find that

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.819 
do this part by hand but I find that
there's<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.250> much<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.670> mix<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
there's so much to mix that this is the

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.009 
there's so much to mix that this is the
one<00:03:18.980> time<00:03:19.220> where<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.700> food<00:03:20.180> processor<00:03:20.750> really

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
one time where a food processor really

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.020 
one time where a food processor really
does<00:03:21.200> help<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.670> then<00:03:22.819> you've<00:03:23.600> apparated<00:03:24.079> milk

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
does help but then you've apparated milk

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.699 
does help but then you've apparated milk
just<00:03:26.030> all<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.410> same<00:03:27.680> place<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:30.049> given<00:03:30.319> of

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
just all in the same place and given of

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.370 
just all in the same place and given of
course<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.970> I'm<00:03:32.030> just<00:03:32.180> gonna<00:03:32.329> put<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.170> lid<00:03:33.350> on

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
course now I'm just gonna put the lid on

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.770 
course now I'm just gonna put the lid on
lock<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.549> then<00:03:35.150> I'm<00:03:35.239> gonna<00:03:35.389> start<00:03:35.630> on

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
lock it in and then I'm gonna start on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.960 
lock it in and then I'm gonna start on
low<00:03:36.049> until<00:03:36.349> it's<00:03:37.310> all<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.849> about

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
low until it's all just about

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.180 
low until it's all just about
incorporated<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:38.959> I'm<00:03:39.049> gonna<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.620> pick<00:03:39.980> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
incorporated and I'm gonna just pick the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.819 
incorporated and I'm gonna just pick the
speed<00:03:41.180> up<00:03:41.329> to<00:03:41.510> medium<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.109> let<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.410> blend<00:03:42.590> for

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
speed up to medium and let it blend for

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.830 
speed up to medium and let it blend for
about<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.069> minute<00:03:43.340> until<00:03:43.519> everything<00:03:43.700> is<00:03:44.269> super

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
about a minute until everything is super
