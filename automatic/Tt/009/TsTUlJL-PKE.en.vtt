00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.210 
all in you should be willing to go broke
with<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:09.850> hands<00:02:10.270> if<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.350> flop<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> set<00:02:12.070> and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
with some hands if you flop a set and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.980 
with some hands if you flop a set and
the<00:02:12.459> only<00:02:12.640> thing<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.420> beat<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.959> a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
the only thing that can beat you is a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.410 
the only thing that can beat you is a
higher<00:02:14.290> set<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.250> shouldn't<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.760> afraid<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.240> it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
higher set you shouldn't be afraid of it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.720 
higher set you shouldn't be afraid of it
the<00:02:17.230> chances<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.890> happening<00:02:17.950> are<00:02:18.490> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the chances of this happening are so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.000 
the chances of this happening are so
small<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:20.020> amount<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.410> money<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.830> will

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
small and the amount of money you will

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.100 
small and the amount of money you will
not<00:02:21.190> gain<00:02:21.520> by<00:02:21.760> playing<00:02:22.060> less<00:02:22.300> aggressively<00:02:22.840> is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
not gain by playing less aggressively is

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.930 
not gain by playing less aggressively is
bigger<00:02:23.410> than<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.190> you'd<00:02:24.340> lose<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.820> your

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
bigger than what you'd lose if your

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.590 
bigger than what you'd lose if your
opponent<00:02:25.450> has<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> better<00:02:25.959> set<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:27.600> second

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
opponent has a better set a second

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.449 
opponent has a better set a second
example<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.350> when<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.160> pot

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
example is when you have the right pot

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.240 
example is when you have the right pot
odds<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.300> meaning<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:33.070> have<00:02:33.100> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
odds to do it meaning if you have a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.910 
odds to do it meaning if you have a
straight<00:02:33.610> flush<00:02:33.850> draw<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.480> thus<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.800> a

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
straight flush draw and thus more than a

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.980 
straight flush draw and thus more than a
50%<00:02:36.250> chance<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.060> hitting<00:02:37.360> your<00:02:37.480> card<00:02:37.750> by<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
50% chance of hitting your card by the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.580 
50% chance of hitting your card by the
river<00:02:38.290> an<00:02:39.450> important<00:02:40.450> rule<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.440> it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
river an important rule is that it's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.680 
river an important rule is that it's
better<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> better<00:02:42.550> rather<00:02:43.239> than<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
better to be the better rather than the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.870 
better to be the better rather than the
