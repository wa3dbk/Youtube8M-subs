00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 I think we always thank you very much. 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.770
 especially for players who have 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.000
 time to talk to us and give us this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.470
 availability 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 and it is with such gratitude that people 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.280
 contact with alessandro and with 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 Mauritian hail hail hail hail good 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.119
 afternoon good afternoon to all barreto 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 friends of the selection to d'alessandro 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.510
 captain and once again champion in the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 international and inter commemorating 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 d'alessandro five consecutive titles 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.140
 and is celebrating the penta actually 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 for you are right because hex had sorority 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.880
 in 2010 but in 2009 you were champion 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.360
 And here's how it goes with the hexacampeonato 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.219
 too much trouble in the shortcut to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.520
 all there on a sportv channel 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.300
 happy happy think the whole championship 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 has a different story 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 has a lot to do with quantity, but 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.860
 quality is and I think this 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 the championship was different 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.329
 a very positive point and a point is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.060
 here in our title gaucho was the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.549
 budget that was our coach who 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 I think only repeating the team in the final 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.740
 henin in the final by law in the final 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.540
 Varzim entered the second half in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.490
 arena but it was always stunned we went 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 We understand them when they spoke to us this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 trick 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 let's understand that it has not reached a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840
 show had to be prepared for the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.240
 another had to train well had to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 then I think it was a point 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 very positive and this is a way 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 different and do not even work but do 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 different, I also think it's a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.390
 Your ambition because of you here. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.909
 has South American which is a huge title 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 who was then in 2010 when loses 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.820
 ground has the liberators of America and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.130
 You, the year's end was elected the best. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.689
 player of South America but in 2010 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.759
 lost the gaucho to win the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.549
 liberators now have liberators of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.079
 new the inter is the gaucho champion and the other 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.969
 expectation that the inter- 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.500
 favoritism with wolves four or five 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.329
 Candidates for Brazilians 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.220
 It's time and what you need to do to 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.880
 change this story add these tracks 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.350
 bigger chest that was once again 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.540
 we have a debt within 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 The Brazilian will not be bothered by my foot. 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.730
 has a debt is up because it is a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.320
 personal goal is a collective goal 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.300
 huh 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.390
 I joined a club with a history 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.670
 very big he's a size club 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.840
 still can not go 36 years without winning 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.980
 a national title 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.320
 The Brazilian knows that the cup of Brazil 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.910
 it is also important but the Brazilian 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:45.870
 The fan that charges more is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.390
 It's always nice to hear that the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.670
 gauchão is not measured but always good 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.290
 winning is never good to lose worse is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.220
 strength and lose and continue 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.400
 Working 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.630
 the work is more enjoyable with the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.700
 work, the coach has 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.690
 more tranquility to move the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.110
 team 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 Unfortunately the technology has a 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.630
 decision has no time to celebrate 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.100
 the athletic is living it too 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:18.180
 too but I think it was very 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.460
 deserved and this money we have 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.370
 it is also in our head in our 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.740
 group in our thinking is that people 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.390
 It's not around, I think it's a big 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.900
 difference not only today we have a 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.480
 strong cast was not drawn to us 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.810
 had both dropped refused the question 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.760
 So much as everyone has today. Everyone 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.860
 no one focused on home flavor then 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.410
 This is going to be important. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.940
 Barreto feel free, I want to make the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.740
 first question you can ask later 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.940
 to luis pradinho but zé called me 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.190
 attention there is in the first response of the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.950
 d'alessandro when he said that the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.760
 players were understanding the proposal of the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.530
 aguirre 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.340
 I want to know exactly how it went 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.500
 this one was understanding from the beginning 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.300
 his proposal when he arrived he and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.700
 told you will play everybody players 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.760
 already accepted had some 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.680
 resistance took a little bit and baby 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.350
 to our Brazilian football culture 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.060
 and d'alessandro is already a player 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.250
 fully integrated into the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.870
 Brazilian football here has a 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.880
 reservation arrives with some proposal 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.510
 strangeness it will cause as it is that 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.669
 It was not easy, but I do. 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.350
 Something that I talked to the group I 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.990
 I want a player who is annoyed by not 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.389
 play I want player who bothers by 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.370
 not be a holder like you and for not having 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.990
 this condition stopped playing always 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.760
 Of course I always want to play 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.860
 only honestly today at my age 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.229
 and my posture and my leadership 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.000
 within the different group with that of alexa 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.789
 of the year is rafael moura to animate the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.350
 people have been through a lot and 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.490
 people are on the easy way I 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.199
 personally years ago I wanted to play 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.600
 he was always very annoyed when he did not 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.900
 I played today, we'll talk soon. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.910
 more with coach has more freedom 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.070
 to talk to the guide he gives this 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.449
 freedom brother eta but i wanted the 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.000
 player always wants to play 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.979
 we have to have a whole world group 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.510
 focused on everyone wanting to play and 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.810
 players get irritated by our place 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.200
 I get upset and when you come in, you have to 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.200
 give an account
