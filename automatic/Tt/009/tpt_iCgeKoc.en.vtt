I got it bet it in there connected
strength<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> winch<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.079> found<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
strength to the winch and I found out

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
strength to the winch and I found out
that<00:00:52.710> after<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:54.660> on

my<00:00:59.520> truck<00:01:00.329> battery<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.699> it'll<00:01:02.699> hold<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> charge

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
my truck battery so it'll hold a charge

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200 
my truck battery so it'll hold a charge
that<00:01:03.480> low<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.700> multiple

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
car battery to the battery on the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.710 
car battery to the battery on the
Soliman<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.700> run<00:01:17.909> down<00:01:18.210> while<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> use

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
Soliman so it don't run down while I use

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.649 
Soliman so it don't run down while I use
it<00:01:18.869> over<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> first<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> got

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
it over and over so first of all I got

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.070 
it over and over so first of all I got
to<00:01:21.689> take<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> cable<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> run<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to take the cable and run it out to the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.999 
to take the cable and run it out to the
law<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.680> weighs<00:01:25.950> 2,500<00:01:26.580> pounds<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:28.229> per<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
law which weighs 2,500 pounds as per the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.780 
law which weighs 2,500 pounds as per the

this<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.329> pretty<00:01:33.509> heavy<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this one here is pretty heavy I have a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
this one here is pretty heavy I have a
hard<00:01:34.439> time<00:01:34.619> roll<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.220> any<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
hard time roll than any at all with a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.050 
hard time roll than any at all with a
can't<00:01:36.360> hook<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> we'll<00:01:38.159> let<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> winch<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
can't hook so we'll let the winch do the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.660 
can't hook so we'll let the winch do the
work

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.140 

okay<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:47.920> had<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.250> cut<00:01:48.430> off<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.820> run<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
okay well I had it cut off I run the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.410 
okay well I had it cut off I run the
cable<00:01:49.510> out<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.040> see<00:01:51.400> here<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.909> comes<00:01:52.150> out

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
cable out now you see here it comes out

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.640 
cable out now you see here it comes out
of<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.720> winch<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.250> cable<00:01:54.610> goes<00:01:54.790> down<00:01:55.180> over

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
of the winch the cable goes down over

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.790 
of the winch the cable goes down over
the<00:01:56.650> top<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.070> log<00:01:57.220> under<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.060> log<00:01:58.330> and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
the top of the log under the log and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.100 
the top of the log under the log and
back<00:01:59.800> over<00:02:00.040> here<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:01.330> connected<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.930> this

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
back over here and connected to this

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.440 
back over here and connected to this
side<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.619> sawmill<00:02:03.040> on<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.550> frame<00:02:06.450> can

side of the sawmill on the frame can

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.240 
side of the sawmill on the frame can
hook<00:02:07.720> this<00:02:07.869> is<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> can't<00:02:08.350> hook<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:09.100> know

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
hook this is a can't hook if you know

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.729 
hook this is a can't hook if you know
used<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.030> logging<00:02:10.929> that's<00:02:11.230> what<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.560> use<00:02:11.709> to

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
used to logging that's what you use to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.270 
used to logging that's what you use to
move<00:02:12.610> those<00:02:12.850> around<00:02:13.650> real<00:02:14.650> hard<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.100> that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
move those around real hard to do that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.210 
move those around real hard to do that
one<00:02:15.489> but<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.180> heavy<00:02:16.390> with

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.930 
charge my battery in a week or two it
was<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.930> 85%<00:02:29.410> charge<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
was then to 85% charge this is the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.750 
was then to 85% charge this is the
little<00:02:31.440> battery<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.620> use<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:35.519> this<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.580> a

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
little battery I use and this is a

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820 
little battery I use and this is a
cylinder<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.330> goes<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.200> helps<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
cylinder that goes that helps when the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.100 
cylinder that goes that helps when the
with<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.130> switch<00:02:39.430> got<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.390> mounted<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.930> here

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
with a switch got it mounted in here

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.479 
with a switch got it mounted in here
this<00:02:41.260> don't<00:02:41.530> move<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:41.980> stays<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.430> there

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
this don't move this stays right there

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.550 
this don't move this stays right there
so<00:02:43.330> people<00:02:43.510> might<00:02:43.810> say<00:02:43.989> oh<00:02:44.019> he's<00:02:44.350> got<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
so people might say oh he's got a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.130 
so people might say oh he's got a
toolbox<00:02:45.250> left<00:02:45.850> toolbox<00:02:46.300> only<00:02:46.570> saw<00:02:46.750> me<00:02:46.989> always

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
toolbox left toolbox only saw me always

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.900 
toolbox left toolbox only saw me always

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
taken stick to controllers this is some

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.830 
taken stick to controllers this is some
other<00:02:55.660> toolbox<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.410> got<00:02:56.590> mounted<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.070> here

switch you take this end here and you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.060 
switch you take this end here and you
just<00:03:08.829> plug<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.310> straight<00:03:09.430> into<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.030> side<00:03:10.239> here

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
just plug it straight into the side here
