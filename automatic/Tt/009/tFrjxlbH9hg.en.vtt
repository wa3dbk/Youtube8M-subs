 It's not that big even though it has changed 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.540

 It is you come early to hang pretty Hey km 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 Well there is such a reason, maybe 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 I think the clip can not sleep 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.830
 Yes 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.920
 It's pretty fast . 4 prefectures seems to be incurable, so maybe there's also a netsofil and you can get a clip now 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.340
