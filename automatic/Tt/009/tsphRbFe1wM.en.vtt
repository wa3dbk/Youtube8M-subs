00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 hello everyone to the average of 691 like 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.560
 always the call of duty does not stop happening 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.090
 strange things and of course I'm here 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.369
 with a joke video to teach you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.080
 apart from situations like those that 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.880
 be the beginning of the video because I'm going to 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.919
 focus on the theme of the flags is 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.419
 more typical what is happening now the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.130
 what by the heading of the game if here 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.899
 to make a double and sent it right 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.820
 there when he went to all the flag 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.370
 good is something that I will be constantly 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.050
 but it's more normal than what I want 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.239
 get me too and other cases 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 let's say normals in which he saw 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.620
 with the flag and opt for a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.109
 exhibition jacket that is not going to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 wait and gave me another one has given him and we go 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.300
 and in the end when the law matters 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.270
 love 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.840
 but good to what I wanted to get was 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.729
 this situation this is certainly nothing 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 normal you see that the enemies take the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.229
 Flag I try then obviously 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.670
 prevent it from reaching its base but what 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
 I do pretty bad and here good 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 encounter with enemies I saw it wrong is 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.569
 when I hide media something does not end 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.729
 losing and of course not, I'll finish 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.340
 killing now but then happened to see 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.869
 torete chamber and it is that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.579
 loses the connection just when you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.829
 there was an individual left over to the flag 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.929
 left to the side but taking advantage 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.030
 the lag michelle alive that is shooting 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.829
 but he is not able to give it for the lag and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 if it is capable medium in dolphin lite of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.429
 save the flags and then just nothing 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 more save it where you recover the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.929
 connection let's go the best those of my life and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.579
 now we go another very rare thing no longer 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.069
 leaving aside the theme of the flags 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.140
 here you are seeing me doing a 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.989
 rush does not seek to destroy the pica quite 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.689
 well because he killed a surcharge and 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:02.819
 covering take me to point to the middle 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.619
 I return to good to look the other way 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.729
 throwing a grenade I look back at the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.069
 half of the salt round very well because 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.869
 killed the second and I grow up and I say 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.880
 I go for us and attention that goes to 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.740
 one and the other and the other kill me but 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.110
 I have left here a very strange thing 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.550
 This video also investigates 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.210
 dead I was seeing him here he killed him 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.920
 but attentive to the death chamber we see 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.550
 toretto again that seems to attract 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.070
 the weird things 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.570
 release two bullets through coda to 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.280
 through two walls to finish 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.260
 annihilating the enemy but good as 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.660
 very spiteful chills that could not 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.580
 to go unpunished and what he is going to do is 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.260
 give me back the look here that killed and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
 I fall dead that has passed we left the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.340
 death chamber and is this new 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.750
 christs for automatic up through 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.050
 from the wall in a fellow equal 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
 amazing and to finish is of sum 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.840
 importance things well is of certain 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.150
 techniques that are being carried out 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.250
 some players that you see them for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.050
 happen and when you think they're going to come back 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.770
 to shoot themselves instead of returning them 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.330
 they throw you a box with the aim of 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.330
 make you lose bullets and confusion
