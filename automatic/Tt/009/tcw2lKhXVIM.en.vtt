00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.299

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230
 because it's easy to do you do not need 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.540
 apply any heat when carrying 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
 to the races I get to bathe and I do 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.650
 this hairstyle do not need to wait until 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.750
 that my hair dries is easy to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.149
 do as I told them nothing of heat this 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 video they have been asking me 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.780
 very much because I have already used this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.489
 combed in other of my videos and if you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.510
 I would like to learn how to do this 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 hairstyle 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 stay watching this video to start 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.300
 with this hairstyle I will start with 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.300
 perform all my hair 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.880
 I will separate what is this part of 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.870
 up my hair where I want it 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.870
 be the hairstyle 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 I'm going to give a mass and I'm going to separate this 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.230
 hair 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.319
 the rest of the hair that stays here in 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.319
 the sides are going to be combed back 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 I'm going to be using a mirador in gel because 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.240
 I want to grab all your little horses 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.240
 little ones that I have left 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.840
 I pass my fingers through the fixer so that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.149
 it stays well in my hair 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.570
 that's also why it's a brush and think 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.570
 all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.500
 I will also be using the spray 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 fixative 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.900
 I'll grab a list if you practical and 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.900
 I'm going to put it 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.810
 now a time has come to comb 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.180
 in the part of here we are going to be 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.140
 doing the press for salgado the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.150
 hair how many backwards 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.710
 I always start with the part of here 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.540
 opposite and only to break it very 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.870
 little hair to start with 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.870
 braid 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.860
 almost like what is the fringe I'm going to put 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.860
 our dictator 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.790
 if you like, the fringe is turned on and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.500
 I'm not going to do that, you're going to divide your 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.500
 hair in three parts 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.090
 and we are going to make a French braid 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.340
 let's divide the hair into three ends 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.050
 that I already did and the hair we are going to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.950
 do the French braid and we're going to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.690
 do going down 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.690
 putting the ends down 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.040
 and will continue to hold very little 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.040
 hair 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.020
 and the hair will be going towards 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.020
 down 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.990
 [Music] 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.530
 this is one of my casino hairstyles 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.810
 favorite ice cream of the last moment 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.120
 because when I go out when I 'm on 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.050
 career that I'm going to leave home I do not have 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.980
 that apply heat is easy you can 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.980
 do with wet hair 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.190
 this is still the recava hair 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.190
 going down 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.459
 [Music] 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.820
 and we're going to do this until we get to 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.820
 behind 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.169
 do not 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:38.000
 when you have finished to push the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.280
 hair out in front to give 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.880
 volume 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.880
 A) Yes 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.689

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.839
 French and how they pull it like this 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.839
 outside 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.440
 you can put a twine in the part of 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.440
 behind 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.960
 and for those behind the hairstyle that 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.960
