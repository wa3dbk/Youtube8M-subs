00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
is the most dangerous punch in boxing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.359 
is the most dangerous punch in boxing
because<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:39.990> hand<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> little<00:01:41.250> bit

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
because the right hand is a little bit

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
because the right hand is a little bit
too<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.939> further<00:01:42.329> away<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.869> chin<00:01:43.200> so

too is further away from your chin so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
too is further away from your chin so
it's<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.390> hard<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> land<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it's a little bit hard to land but the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.190
