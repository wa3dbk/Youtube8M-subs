because<00:01:38.930> that's<00:01:39.110> where<00:01:39.290> your<00:01:39.410> power<00:01:39.560> supply

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
because that's where your power supply

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800 
because that's where your power supply
will<00:01:40.160> go<00:01:40.280> underneath<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:41.150> just<00:01:41.360> gives<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.630> some

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
will go underneath it just gives it some

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:52.450 
will go underneath it just gives it some
air<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:45.170> I'll<00:01:45.320> get<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.620> old<00:01:45.740> little<00:01:51.400> okay<00:01:52.400> so

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
there's quite a lot of room inside I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.000 
there's quite a lot of room inside I
said<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.670> will<00:01:55.790> take<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:56.180> full<00:01:56.660> sized<00:01:57.010> ATX

included a couple of a 60 mil rear fans
to<00:02:52.550> exhort<00:02:52.880> some<00:02:53.090> heat

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.580 

so<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> set<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.210> power<00:03:03.420> supply<00:03:03.600> goes<00:03:04.110> here<00:03:04.380> at

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
so I set the power supply goes here at

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.710 
so I set the power supply goes here at
the<00:03:04.740> front<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> chassis<00:03:05.600> basically<00:03:06.600> you

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the front of the chassis basically you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.150 
the front of the chassis basically you
just<00:03:06.750> remove<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.350> front<00:03:07.620> panel<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.980> very

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
just remove this front panel is very

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.310 
just remove this front panel is very
easy<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.460> do<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.700> tug<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.300> off<00:03:09.420> its<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:09.990> clips

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
easy to do just tug it off its on clips

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.260 
easy to do just tug it off its on clips
and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.030> screw<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:14.240> from<00:03:15.240> the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
and then you can screw it in from the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.510 
and then you can screw it in from the
front<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:16.730> little<00:03:17.730> fly<00:03:18.000> lead<00:03:18.300> here<00:03:19.310> plug<00:03:20.310> into

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
front a little fly lead here plug into

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.330 
front a little fly lead here plug into
the<00:03:20.700> front<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> fly<00:03:22.860> fly<00:03:23.130> lead

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the front of it and the fly fly lead

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.890 
the front of it and the fly fly lead
then<00:03:23.850> goes<00:03:24.030> back<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> rear<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
then goes back to the rear of the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.740 
then goes back to the rear of the
chassis<00:03:25.970> where<00:03:26.970> would<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.120> put<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.600> cap

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
chassis where would you put your cap

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.560 
chassis where would you put your cap
your<00:03:27.960> power<00:03:28.110> cord<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:32.190> space<00:03:32.610> into<00:03:33.090> early<00:03:33.390> is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
your power cord this space into early is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
your power cord this space into early is
probably<00:03:34.110> already<00:03:34.290> said<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.310> x<00:03:35.610> 5.25<00:03:36.590> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
probably already said for one x 5.25 so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.910 
probably already said for one x 5.25 so
that's<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.830> cd-rom<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.430> blu-ray<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:40.790> then<00:03:41.790> a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
that's the cd-rom or blu-ray and then a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.010 
that's the cd-rom or blu-ray and then a
little<00:03:43.920> bracket<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.580> comes<00:03:44.910> with<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
little bracket that comes with it so

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.990 
little bracket that comes with it so
your<00:03:46.230> cd-rom<00:03:46.740> goes<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.280> top<00:03:47.310> your<00:03:47.790> hard

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
your cd-rom goes on the top your hard

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.750 
your cd-rom goes on the top your hard
drive<00:03:48.240> underneath<00:03:48.780> there<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:51.990> also

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
drive underneath there you can also

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.690 
drive underneath there you can also
unscrew<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> bottom<00:03:54.270> panel<00:03:55.520> once<00:03:56.520> that's

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
unscrew the bottom panel once that's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.900 
unscrew the bottom panel once that's
done<00:03:57.000> there's<00:03:57.390> room<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:58.160> screw<00:03:59.160> from<00:03:59.280> below<00:03:59.610> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
done there's room to screw from below a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.910 
done there's room to screw from below a
further<00:04:00.510> three<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.110> half<00:04:01.140> inch<00:04:01.560> hard<00:04:01.830> drive
