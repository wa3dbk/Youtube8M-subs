me<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:04.909> it's<00:01:05.329> and<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:06.020> ethics<00:01:06.350> okay<00:01:07.219> you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
me and it's and the ethics okay you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.849 
me and it's and the ethics okay you
can't<00:01:07.549> read<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:07.969> but<00:01:08.389> either<00:01:09.229> combat

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
can't read that but either combat

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.449 
can't read that but either combat
buttons<00:01:10.159> easy<00:01:11.119> big<00:01:11.420> round<00:01:11.630> ones<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.249> I<00:01:13.249> think

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
buttons easy big round ones and I think

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
black ops I like black ops but to me

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.860 
black ops I like black ops but to me
bottle<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.210> two<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.540> better<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:56.300> only

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
bottle for two is better and I only

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.440 
bottle for two is better and I only
think<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.200> because<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:58.330> guess<00:02:59.330> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
think that because I guess the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.270 
think that because I guess the
killstreaks<00:02:59.960> are<00:03:00.140> better<00:03:00.350> or<00:03:00.680> something

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
killstreaks are better or something

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.770 
killstreaks are better or something
because<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:03.050> like<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.620> lot<00:03:04.520> better<00:03:04.780> but

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
because I just like it a lot better but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.500 
because I just like it a lot better but
when<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.050> was<00:03:06.200> over<00:03:06.380> at<00:03:06.410> my<00:03:06.500> friend's<00:03:06.890> house<00:03:07.510> he

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
when I was over at my friend's house he

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.750 
when I was over at my friend's house he
broke<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.930> so<00:03:09.730> I'm<00:03:10.730> sucked<00:03:11.210> playing<00:03:12.550> black<00:03:13.550> ops

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
broke it so I'm sucked playing black ops

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.030 
broke it so I'm sucked playing black ops
which<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> fun<00:03:14.780> game<00:03:14.810> I'm<00:03:15.290> not<00:03:15.410> gonna<00:03:15.500> lie<00:03:15.710> I

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
which is a fun game I'm not gonna lie I

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.650 
which is a fun game I'm not gonna lie I
thing<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:16.730> yeah<00:03:17.090> Oh<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> controller<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
thing but yeah Oh in this controller I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.310 
thing but yeah Oh in this controller I
think<00:03:20.660> I've<00:03:20.750> already<00:03:20.900> said<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.170> was<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
think I've already said it was a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.090 
think I've already said it was a
procedure<00:03:21.710> named<00:03:21.920> controller<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:23.600> me<00:03:23.810> I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
procedure named controller and to me I

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.660 
procedure named controller and to me I
think<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.430> helps<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:26.020> aiming<00:03:27.370> because<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.490> fits

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
think it helps in aiming because it fits

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.480 
think it helps in aiming because it fits
your<00:03:28.820> hands<00:03:29.210> better<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.160> since<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.340> like

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
your hands better and since it's like

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.350 
your hands better and since it's like
sure<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.690> crap<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:35.060> move<00:03:35.210> around

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
sure that crap like you can move around

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.740 
sure that crap like you can move around
faster<00:03:35.930> like<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:36.800> look<00:03:37.040> around<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.150> like

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
faster like and like look around so like

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.230 
faster like and like look around so like
you<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.050> higher<00:03:39.230> sensitivity<00:03:39.650> or<00:03:40.280> lower<00:03:40.940> it

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
you can higher sensitivity or lower it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.390 
you can higher sensitivity or lower it
because<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:42.140> will<00:03:42.320> make<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.650> move<00:03:42.830> faster

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
because this will make you move faster

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.950 
because this will make you move faster
than<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:44.510> crap<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:46.190> yeah<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.810> love<00:03:47.810> this

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
than that crap so yeah I love this

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.400 
than that crap so yeah I love this
controller<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.730> I'm<00:03:49.730> thinking<00:03:50.360> mad<00:03:50.810> catz<00:03:51.050> and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
controller and I'm thinking mad catz and

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.980 
controller and I'm thinking mad catz and
treyarch<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.010> activating<00:03:52.460> for<00:03:52.930> making<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
treyarch and activating for making it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:01.880 
treyarch and activating for making it
because<00:03:54.320> it's<00:03:54.680> just<00:03:54.880> great<00:03:56.290> piece

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.450 

you

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460
