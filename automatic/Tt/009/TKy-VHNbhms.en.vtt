00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
think Sega was so afraid that people who

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.539 
think Sega was so afraid that people who
would<00:03:48.260> be<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.440> little<00:03:48.680> overwhelmed<00:03:49.310> by<00:03:49.489> this

were<00:06:59.010> really<00:06:59.280> good<00:06:59.490> but<00:07:00.090> it<00:07:00.300> would<00:07:00.420> have<00:07:00.480> been

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
were really good but it would have been

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.720

really<00:07:00.900> neat<00:07:01.140> if<00:07:01.320> they<00:07:01.470> had<00:07:01.680> paid<00:07:02.010> a<00:07:02.040> homage<00:07:02.550> to

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
really neat if they had paid a homage to

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.000 
really neat if they had paid a homage to
the<00:07:03.060> first<00:07:03.270> game<00:07:03.570> and<00:07:03.750> done<00:07:04.260> the<00:07:04.350> 3d<00:07:04.620> dungeons
