00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 medical students are worried 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.839
 for their future we expect more than 2000 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.540
 students in the capital this after 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.240
 noon a street a demonstration for 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.280
 ask that any student be able to enjoy 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 a registration number with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.920
 the inami sinequanone condition and well 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.769
 to be able to exercise more than 500 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.390
 students are currently gathered 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 on the campus of him is the flight hui 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 among them gabriel navy you are at 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 the initiative somewhere from this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 Brussels rally so remember 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 we a little bit it's true that we do not 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 has been talking for a long time about this problem of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 numerus clausus then there has been 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 obviously some modifications of the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 federal government recently then 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.910
 why again take the tone of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910
 the demonstration 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 because currently the problem is 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.050
 that all students who are in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.200
 medical curricula are not concerned 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.120
 by recent 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.550
 reasons government publication 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.699
 and there will actually be a problem 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.320
 for at least 5 years consecutively 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 in curriculum that will that will not 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.310
 not enough inami numbers at the end of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.510
 studies and so students who get 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.820
 will regain with a medical degree 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.310
 but no opportunity to exercise 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 any case in the current situation 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 you think it's an outcry of the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.220
 manifestation we learned but the medicine 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.950
 it's complicated studies and we think 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 not that it is normal that we can 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.759
 launch in such studies without the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.660
 to have the opportunity to exercise the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.369
 job for which we worked 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.530
 for seven years to now six years 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.840
 and so it 's not normal that the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.479
 government default work or 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.940
 by not taking into account the situation 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.530
 current medicine in Belgium does not 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.570
 not react to allow all 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.009
 students who are in courses from 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.649
 ability to practice at the end of their studies 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.960
 you also denounce the lack of space 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:02:00.619
 in the context of your internships 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.850
 when it happens in hospitals lot of 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.960
 problems behind this problem of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.429
 Inami numbers and we talk a lot about them 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.619
 less for the moment and so 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.700
 general is that besides the numbers 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.679
 inami that actually lacks there 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.300
 after seven years of study a 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.800
 specialization to do that it's in 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.840
 a specialized medicine or in the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.680
 general medicine and to be able to do 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 this specialization 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.200
 it is necessary to have a master of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.330
 internship to have a place in hospital and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.459
 that all and all these measures are 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.670
 actually funded actually it 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.530
 there are not enough internship places there are 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.490
 doctors who would like to be 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.110
 internship supervisor who does not have the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.910
 possibility because very criteria 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.360
 strict regulate the people who 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.069
 can be a tutor and so 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.780
 even if the government gave 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.300
 today the numbers inami at all 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.190
 students a curriculum at least for the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.020
 string of 2018 which takes over both 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.640
 years that will end together those who 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.000
 are currently in the 2nd and 3rd year of 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.650
 medicine 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.790
 there will not be enough internship places 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 not enough training supervisor for 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.940
 supervise their training and their license 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.230
 allow them to finish their 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.849
 flagship specialization or even of 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.470
 start their specialization in 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.580
 good conditions 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.670
 thank you gold and levis for all 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.170
 clarifications reminds that the event 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.900
 will start around 2 pm on the side of 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.610
 albertine to move next 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.040
 to the cabinet of a minister of 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.040
 health around the central station
