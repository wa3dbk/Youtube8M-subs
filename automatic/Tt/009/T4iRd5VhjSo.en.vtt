00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.280 
that you can buy each game you can have
up<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> three<00:02:18.220> boosts<00:02:19.210> unless<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.810> purchase<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290

up to three boosts unless you purchase a
fourth<00:02:20.590> slot<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.210> we'll<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.450> ahead<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.690> click

fourth slot so we'll go ahead and click
start<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.850> basically<00:02:25.110> what<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> game<00:02:26.470> does

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
is up here it gives you a number to add

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.980 
is up here it gives you a number to add
to<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.460> all<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.270> choose<00:02:31.660> from

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the numbers on the board to add to that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
the numbers on the board to add to that
number<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.720> we'll<00:02:37.930> do<00:02:38.730> really<00:02:39.730> quick<00:02:39.940> will<00:02:40.240> do

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
nine and four you can see it's 13 do 77

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.390 
nine and four you can see it's 13 do 77
just<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.990> show<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.410> quick<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.950> up

here in the top right corner your score

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.910 
here in the top right corner your score
is<00:02:51.160> calculated<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:52.990> see<00:02:53.290> if<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.650> have

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
is calculated can also see if you have

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.180 
is calculated can also see if you have
boosts<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> require<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.540> actually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
boosts that require you to actually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.530 
boosts that require you to actually
touch<00:02:57.190> them<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.970> use<00:02:58.150> them<00:02:58.420> they're<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.350> here

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
touch them to use them they're up here

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.470 
touch them to use them they're up here
also<00:03:01.800> your<00:03:02.800> timers<00:03:03.100> down<00:03:03.459> here<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.060> pause

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
also your timers down here you can pause

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.520 
also your timers down here you can pause

we're<00:03:11.230> back<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.530> main<00:03:11.709> menu<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:16.150> regulars

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
we're back to the main menu the regulars

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.390 
we're back to the main menu the regulars
are<00:03:16.810> think<00:03:16.989> it's<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.560> pretty<00:03:17.739> fun<00:03:18.010> game<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.280> play

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
are think it's a pretty fun game to play

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.430 
are think it's a pretty fun game to play
it's<00:03:19.000> very<00:03:19.510> simple<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.170> straightforward

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
it's very simple and straightforward

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.630 
it's very simple and straightforward
which<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.130> always<00:03:21.310> nice<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.950> timed<00:03:24.250> games

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
which is always nice and the timed games

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.320 
which is always nice and the timed games
last<00:03:25.050> 60<00:03:26.050> seconds<00:03:26.640> unless<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:27.820> boosts

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
last 60 seconds unless you have boosts

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.130 
last 60 seconds unless you have boosts
on<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:30.160> we'll<00:03:30.519> go<00:03:30.670> ahead<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.180> we'll<00:03:31.300> go<00:03:31.900> back

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
on so we'll go ahead and we'll go back

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.440 
on so we'll go ahead and we'll go back
to<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.410> main<00:03:32.620> menu<00:03:35.459> after<00:03:36.459> you're<00:03:36.850> playing

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
to the main menu after you're playing

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.500 
to the main menu after you're playing
that<00:03:37.630> game<00:03:37.840> let's<00:03:38.440> see<00:03:38.620> we<00:03:38.950> lost<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.090> ruby<00:03:40.360> heart

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
that game let's see we lost a ruby heart

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.460 
that game let's see we lost a ruby heart
so<00:03:40.930> we're<00:03:41.080> down<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.380> five<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.590> had<00:03:41.980> six<00:03:42.459> before

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
so we're down to five I had six before

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.290 
so we're down to five I had six before
now<00:03:44.470> i'm<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.830> show<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.300> turn-based

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
now i'm going to show you turn-based

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.640 
now i'm going to show you turn-based
which<00:03:46.870> also<00:03:47.170> uses<00:03:47.530> boosts<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.650> these

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
which also uses boosts but this is these

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.530 
which also uses boosts but this is these
are<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.860> different<00:03:51.130> set<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.580> boosts<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.390> are

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
are a different set of boosts that are

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.600 
are a different set of boosts that are
catered<00:03:53.290> more<00:03:53.590> toward<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.610> style<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.489> we'll

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
catered more toward this style so we'll

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.000 
catered more toward this style so we'll
go<00:03:57.730> ahead<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:57.910> start<00:03:58.269> without<00:03:58.420> them<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.010> what

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
go ahead and start without them and what

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.310 
go ahead and start without them and what
this<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.700> instead<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.720> being<00:04:01.750> timed

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
this is is instead of it being timed

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.729 
this is is instead of it being timed
it's<00:04:02.910> strictly<00:04:03.910> turn-based<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.470> can<00:04:05.590> see

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
it's strictly turn-based so you can see

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.289 
it's strictly turn-based so you can see
down<00:04:05.950> here<00:04:06.100> at<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.280> bottom<00:04:06.370> you<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:06.820> 19

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
down here at the bottom you have 19

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.720 
down here at the bottom you have 19
turns<00:04:07.570> left<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.680> can<00:04:08.860> use<00:04:08.980> boosts<00:04:09.519> to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
turns left and you can use boosts to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.479 
turns left and you can use boosts to
change<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.799> if<00:04:11.799> you<00:04:11.950> want<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.160> add<00:04:12.280> more

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
change that if you want to add more

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.449 
change that if you want to add more
terms<00:04:12.730> but<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:14.080> concept<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.830> same<00:04:14.860> your

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
terms but the concept is the same your

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.449 
terms but the concept is the same your
numbers<00:04:15.760> up<00:04:15.790> here<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.540> use<00:04:17.459> either

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
numbers up here and you use either

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.240 
numbers up here and you use either
numbers<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> board<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:20.709> add<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.220> that

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
numbers on the board to add to that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.300 
numbers on the board to add to that
number<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.820> as<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:23.320> do<00:04:23.500> better<00:04:23.710> as<00:04:24.130> you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
number and as you do better as you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.560 
number and as you do better as you
progress<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.850> numbers<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:25.360> higher<00:04:25.389> and

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
progress the numbers get higher and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.290 
progress the numbers get higher and
higher<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:26.200> add<00:04:26.320> 2<00:04:26.590> which<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.400> nice<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:28.150> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
higher to add 2 which is nice I like the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.500 
higher to add 2 which is nice I like the
fact<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.810> gets<00:04:28.930> difficult<00:04:29.139> as<00:04:29.680> you
