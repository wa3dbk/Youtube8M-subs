 next episode next Sunday I 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.560

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 of the one piece anime however if

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 this special one piece of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 2 hours what is interesting about this 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.850
 episode do not give you this special that they're going 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.559
 to do is that good is going to treat what 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.050
 is the story that has not been told well 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.570
 the one piece manga and anime 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 history that has lived this light and with 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.270
 silver riley for two years the time is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.969
 that the so famous and that everyone talks and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 you're going to focus on this this character in 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.780
 light and our main protagonist of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.720
 how he has lived with centuries of law during 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.870
 these two years and with the inclusion of 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.610
 a new enemy of the enemy so 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 theorized and the one that's been done let's say 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.590
 predictions of who could do what 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.000
 that there was going to be published or was going to give 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.620
 meet a new enemy in the series of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.870
 One piece is surely about 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.640
 special is where this will appear 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.880
 new enemy is not no other hong 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.250
 kong and another no identity is not treated 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 of a character in which we do not have the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.780
 name that I do not know if it's bar nor world but 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
 you can not specify it exactly and not 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 I want to give you the wrong information 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 but if we already say it has done a 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 character created by the same way that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.570
 participate in this two - hour special 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.729
 do not try to reflect that story what 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.680
 would be after the death of 'aces' and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.600
 of the mind form war and reflect a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.580
 little what this light has lived and in those 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 two years is not something that many of us are 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 intrigued if we would get it as 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.030
 fill the anime or just be 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.400
 it would come out in manga stories and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
 covers that we always have with each 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.869
 volume not and well this is the news not 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.900
 I leave you in the description the three links 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.909

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.229
 special 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.969
 so that we can say you can throw a 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.920
 look are very short but good 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.999
