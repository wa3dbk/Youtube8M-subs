sticks where c is playing / also much

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.930 
sticks where c is playing / also much
iron<00:03:19.790> right<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.049> where<00:03:21.260> t<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.560> stick<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
iron right and then where t is stick so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.860 
iron right and then where t is stick so
see

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
see

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.250 
see
is<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:25.099> wood<00:03:25.400> or<00:03:25.430> anything<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.180> T<00:03:26.780> Stick

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
is the like wood or anything and T Stick

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.930 
is the like wood or anything and T Stick
so<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:27.769> basically<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.220> rest<00:03:28.900> plus<00:03:29.900> recipe

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
so that's basically the rest plus recipe

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.580 
so that's basically the rest plus recipe
this<00:03:33.159> all<00:03:34.159> right<00:03:34.340> X<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.940> Clank<00:03:35.269> right<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.260> X

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
this all right X and Clank right so X

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.839 
this all right X and Clank right so X
keys<00:03:37.580> cobblestone<00:03:38.650> tease<00:03:39.650> iron<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.400> our<00:03:40.640> is

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
keys cobblestone tease iron and our is

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.800 
keys cobblestone tease iron and our is
red<00:03:41.060> so<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.569> never<00:03:42.290> knew<00:03:42.470> how<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> craft<00:03:43.810> piston

more<00:04:16.850> physics<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:18.380> plug<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.889> basically<00:04:19.220> if

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
more physics is plug in basically if

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.909 
more physics is plug in basically if
you're<00:04:20.030> wearing<00:04:20.299> armor<00:04:20.870> it'll<00:04:21.229> slow<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.590> down

I'm probably gonna change that nothing
that's<00:04:24.680> kinda<00:04:25.039> stupid<00:04:25.220> like<00:04:26.150> if<00:04:26.780> your<00:04:26.960> water

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
that's kinda stupid like if your water

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.960 
that's kinda stupid like if your water
you're<00:04:27.530> wearing<00:04:27.770> heavy<00:04:27.950> Arbor<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.700> can't

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
you're wearing heavy Arbor you can't

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.629 
you're wearing heavy Arbor you can't
swim<00:04:29.240> back<00:04:29.450> up<00:04:29.950> before<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.010> have<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.250> careful

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
swim back up before you have it careful

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.089 
swim back up before you have it careful
and<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.000> like<00:04:32.180> Pistons<00:04:32.630> they<00:04:33.410> shoot<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.919> up

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
and it like Pistons they shoot you up

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.290 
and it like Pistons they shoot you up
again<00:04:34.370> like<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.789> mod<00:04:35.560> 1.5<00:04:36.560> if<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.639> use<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.120> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
again like the mod 1.5 if you use it and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.839 
again like the mod 1.5 if you use it and
then<00:04:38.889> crappy<00:04:39.889> dia<00:04:40.039> you<00:04:40.760> basically<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:42.849> wanted

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
yeah so we got these logs we're gonna

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.049
