00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.660
 Barcelona 4-0 at the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.830
 almería the set of luis enrique 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.209
 increases your lead advantage to the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.690
 wait for what he does to his maximum rival 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.339
 Real Madrid a not brilliant match 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.500
 of barcelona but yes quite effective 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.730
 with two goals by Luis Suarez with one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 first action in which he claimed 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.220
 penalty pedro was opening that man the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.500
 ex barcelonista sergi barjuán in the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.950
 Almería's bench 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 to get your first points 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.970
 messi tried the header and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.830
 wellington silva had a very good 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.660
 opportunity for the Andalusian team 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.660
 still with the 0-0 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.370
 his shot was going too 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.590
 used 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.590
 so did Peter's shot of 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.180
 volley after that game change in 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 barcelona that soon began to have 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.600
 your first chances of danger 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.250
 xavi tried the auction with that volley and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.930
 He did not get to worry too much about 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.820
 julián however in an action 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.210
 individual of messi the argentinian 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.670
 I got the 1-0 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.310
 the shot with unreachable thread for 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 julián became the first goal of the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.210
 match in minute 33 of match and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.790
 Barcelona opened the scoring with a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.950
 great goal by leo messi a match that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.380
 went 1-0 to the break and in which 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.810
 Luis Suarez got the 2-0 at 10 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 minutes of the second half is not 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.509
 quite similar to the first one this time 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.550
 Uruguayan striker cutting towards 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.369
 inside and placing the ball with the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.590
 left the barcelona- increased his 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.250
 advantage a boat where I want to have a 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 second part much more comfortable marc 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.690
 bertrán titular in the center of the rear 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 to 3-0 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 the corner kick the anticipation of the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.409
 young central 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.540
 will become the third goal of the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.690
 barcelona marked the new leo messi 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.260
 However, the goal canceled due to lack of 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.270
 Argentine is not out of the game but if 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.369
 lack of leo messi about the player of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.369
 almería before receiving that ball 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 I also tried a direct lack of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.750
 yes good answer from Julian and the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.150
 Almería in the final stretch was going to 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.280
 get to score that if the goal was not going 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.340
 to go up to the scoreboard the zongo center 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.920
 the spectacular goal by tomás somewhat 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.270
 that should have gone up to the score 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.710
 it does not seem to be out of the game 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.600
 player of almería 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.460
 I went up to the goalkeeper if I was going to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.770
 do already in the 93rd minute in the last 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.050
 action of the game the fourth goal the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.200
 second of luis suárez barcelona 4 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.270
 almería 0 the Catalan team is leader 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.400
 the supporter has 74 points and of 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.650
 almeria for its part stays with the 25 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.720
 points that had sum eight days without 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.280
 win and has added only three points of 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.280
 the last 24 possible
