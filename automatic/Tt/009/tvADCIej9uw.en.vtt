00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.160
 Hello to you semolina you today we 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.560
 talk about a member but also events in 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 warcraft it's love fever in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
 particular about farm shores which 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 required for various kinds of achiv and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.480
 mount most probably expensive that you can 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 buy on this holiday 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 have tried different ways of mining these 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 Greeks try to farm on various 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.290
 mobs tried to go along and stuff 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 Other but the most interesting option is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 we get this form or in Varna 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 violent porters 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.879
 where is the window of the passage that will stay after 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 first boss what's the interest of this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.280
 activity 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.329
 but the fact that we have a blue face cutting machine 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.859
 very very quickly it allows us 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 strictly speaking and recruit our shores 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.020
 with considerable speed before all i 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 I read recruited triple tide 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 but now it is no longer available I tried 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 there your chance to fly not only that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.400
 such that in principle is not the fastest 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.470
 place and uncomfortable 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.360
 nevertheless, the department is already not working there 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.090
 So look at what speed 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 recruited bank dare in Varna 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.549
 in fact, I took a simple position 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.549
 at the entrance to the boss 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.510
 I am waiting for all these inquisitive 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.200
 filth or who constantly constantly 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.200
 appear 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.520
 and so while seeing 10 o'clock time 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.430
 us 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:25.720
 I'm 50 amulets well and as you can see time 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:30.250
 50 minutes later I will rub together and how much 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 do we have to file and for that time well 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.250
 we see the handbag is almost full 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.510
 this is not enough for me to mount 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.300
 will have to look here again but 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 no less significant part already 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.140
 collected 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 how much did i have due to or to 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.750
 standard and left quite a bit 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 actually like this in this beautiful 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.680
 a place we can quickly and very efficiently 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.510
 the main thing is not disturbing anyone 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 dial yourself festive holiday 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.850

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.950

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.260
