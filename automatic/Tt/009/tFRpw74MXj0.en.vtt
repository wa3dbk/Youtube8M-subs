00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
ballistic ranging what this allows you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.650 
ballistic ranging what this allows you
to<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.529> TBR<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.010> if<00:00:29.550> you're<00:00:30.210> shooting<00:00:30.480> on

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to do the TBR is if you're shooting on

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.130 
to do the TBR is if you're shooting on
an<00:00:30.750> incline<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.349> decline<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:33.750> will<00:00:33.899> take

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the reading take into account the angle

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.350 
the reading take into account the angle
from<00:00:37.800> where<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> target<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
from where you're out to the target and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.260 
from where you're out to the target and
make<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> necessary<00:00:40.290> calculations<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
make the necessary calculations so that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.840 
make the necessary calculations so that
you<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> true<00:00:44.600> range<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> us<00:00:47.670> know

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you get a true range as most of us know

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.420 
you get a true range as most of us know
if<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.000> shoot<00:00:48.239> high<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:48.719> low<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.350> shooting<00:00:50.160> up

if you shoot high or low or shooting up
or<00:00:50.730> down<00:00:51.000> much<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.590> angle<00:00:54.410> your

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
or down much of a much of an angle your

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.720 
or down much of a much of an angle your
actual<00:00:56.600> distance<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> shorter<00:00:58.289> than<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
actual distance is shorter than the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.279 
actual distance is shorter than the
reading<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.300> give<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.750> enough<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.140> terms

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
reading would give you enough in terms

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.850 
reading would give you enough in terms
of<00:01:02.059> your<00:01:03.059> trajectory<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> was

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of your trajectory so you know if it was

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.940 
of your trajectory so you know if it was
up<00:01:05.119> on<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> cliff<00:01:06.510> fairly<00:01:07.110> high<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.470> 3<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> 80

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
up on a cliff fairly high at 3 and 80

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.050 
up on a cliff fairly high at 3 and 80
yards<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.490> example<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:10.140> range<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
yards for example and you range it and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.510 
yards for example and you range it and
didn't<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> TBR<00:01:12.570> function<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:14.400> would

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
didn't have the TBR function you would

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
didn't have the TBR function you would
get<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> reading<00:01:15.000> say<00:01:15.180> 385<00:01:17.000> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.240> adjust<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
get a reading say 385 if you adjust it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
get a reading say 385 if you adjust it
for<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.530> scope<00:01:19.860> via<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> dot<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
for that with your scope via a dot you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
for that with your scope via a dot you
know<00:01:21.450> dialing<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.259> holding<00:01:22.590> over<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.159> using

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
know dialing in or holding over or using

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.530 
know dialing in or holding over or using
a<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.080> any<00:01:25.860> point<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> reticle<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a you know any point on the reticle you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
a you know any point on the reticle you
would<00:01:27.659> actually<00:01:28.140> shoot<00:01:28.439> over<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> top<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
would actually shoot over the top of the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.249 
would actually shoot over the top of the
deer<00:01:30.079> or<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.500> whatever<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:32.250> after

nice and compact 6x magnification and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
nice and compact 6x magnification and
glasses<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> glass<00:01:40.290> works<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.220> um

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
glasses the glass works well it's um

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.410 
glasses the glass works well it's um
actually<00:01:42.950> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> serves<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> you

actually kind of serves as kind of a you
know<00:01:45.450> backup<00:01:46.229> monocular<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.610> feel

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
know backup monocular you don't feel

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.850 
know backup monocular you don't feel
like<00:01:48.060> having<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.630> big<00:01:48.780> binoculars<00:01:49.939> with<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
like having your big binoculars with you

one of these I like I typically like to
do<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> hunting<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> new<00:01:55.829> area<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:57.229> get<00:01:58.229> in

do is hunting a new area I will get in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.770 
do is hunting a new area I will get in
and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.649> range<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.939> landmarks<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.659> know

and I will range some landmarks you know

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
and I will range some landmarks you know
different<00:02:01.380> tree<00:02:01.560> lines<00:02:03.049> ridges<00:02:04.049> etc<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.610> that
