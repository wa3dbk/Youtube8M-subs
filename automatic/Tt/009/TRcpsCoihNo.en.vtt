00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.350
 two 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.889
 a house from the 30s in the town 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.840
 of basyurt ting in in southern germany 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.119
 three years ago the katrin architects 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.669
 with noble andy who remodeled it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.000
 now the couple lives on the two floors 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.489
 higher your idea is something unusual and not 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.009
 of the taste of all who visit the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.210
 home not so nothing else enter that here 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.210
 time to rest know 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:44.520
 and I'm raised in this house 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 before, do not take advantage of the attic because 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 we always had it rented during the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 remodeling of the roof that was 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.629
 complicated it occurred to us to install in it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.480
 a house the roof to two waters of the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.640
 attic an air tent for 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 keep that atmosphere the architects 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.830
 They decided to paint white walls 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.500
 floors and furniture accessories and the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.520
 huge window provide the necessary 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 note of color we did not start from the idea of 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.660
 that everything was white was the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 logical consequence at the end of a 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.690
 process in which we study the space 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:33.330
 its characteristics the shape of the roof 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:36.000
 and the attic also the kitchen is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 white made by a carpenter according to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.649
 the specific design of the architects 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.009
 robust work surface 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.110
 make up 90% of quartz one is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.280
 ask if it is practical to live in this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.229
 unspoiled environment 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 there is no problem even if it costs 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.080
 believe it the materials are good very 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 resistant once having eggs of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.390
 easter with beet stain the table 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.390
 red but I could clean them without problems 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 surrounded by white furniture are the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.840
 center of all eyes the table of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.310
 oak wood inherited from a 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.620
 grandfather who was a carpenter and katrin and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.410
 andy like the furniture that is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.209
 adapt to the needs of the moment 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.040
 This six-piece sofa can 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.040
 transform easily 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.090
 we wanted movement and although the couch did not 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.730
 move you can dismantle your 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 site components and can change them 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.830
 create a smooth surface to rest 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.959
 and adjust it to the circumstances or if 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.299
 there are children you can put a blanket for 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.299
 over and create a cave is cute 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.520
 a room of 80 square meters in 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.920
 the one that nothing breaks the harmony the beings and 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.000
 other everyday objects are hidden behind 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.000
 white doors 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.830
 this ladder remained in its color 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 original 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.700
 and on the ground floor the books are 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.700
 the view 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 Y 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 but in the bedroom the white recovers 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.810
 the protagonism 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.340
 we return to the attic the favorite corner of 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.620
 the couple the beautiful views replace 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.040
 the television and allow them to disconnect 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.040
 of everything 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.460
 It is an oasis of tranquility and when opening 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.960
 the sliding window arises a small terrace 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.870
 to sit outdoors 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.030
 in a few years catering not blog and andy that 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.520
 they want to also remodel the part 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.440
 leave the house in terms of color 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.440
 let's say they have a blank mind
