00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.030
 how about friends how about friends 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.790
 welcome to another video review of hey 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:12.200
 lick blogs this time I come to review the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:17.570
 nss of fighter well this set is 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.670
 also from the armory line and in the usa 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.570
 it came out about two weeks like this 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 that were pretty quick to bring it 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.869
 it's a good set has new things 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.610
 and good luckily they did not raise the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.240
 price only costs 209 pesos 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.870
 It has 48 pieces and it is set number 97 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.550
 001 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.550
 it is also the c3 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.790
 from the back we can see how 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.010
 the set would be armed 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.010
 the possible just nuances 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.420
 the 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.320
 that are also available 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.340
 the spartans and the description that says 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.159
 the combat unit with that cobalt 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.399
 not in this case it would be the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.100
 translation of nss which means command 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.640
 special of the united nations prepares 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.880
 marin of the nss exporting if spartans 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.090
 s cub for battle with an armory of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.759
 the uv in that is complete arm your troops 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 with the uv weapons in stool in the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.460
 additional scout armory pieces 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 spartan gives the team the troops 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.229
 necessary for 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.619
 friends and spies not detected in the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.619
 catch 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.760
 good so is the box now Let 's spend a 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.760
 imperative 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.100
 8 steps 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.270
 so it would be 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 those are the pieces 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.860
 and good now let's go to the convoy or not 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.430
 this is the new combat and look if 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.700
 here we can see that all the mini fix 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.780
 they bring a base 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.780
 this is the marin 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.150
 it comes with a 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.840
 your normal rifle is not muted 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.990
 and they have all detailed bags of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.420
 weapons 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:35.420
 and monocle which is green 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.610
 here we can see the new scout good at 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.240
 less for me is new 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.490
 personalize it in the body of the secure 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.620
 because sincerely in the Spartans there 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.260
 the interesting is good and good 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.050
 since being is the new design of 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.460
 rocket launcher is more realistic it gets attached 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.360
 more to the game the previous design was a 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.410
 a plasta 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.860
 it was all crushed and I had nothing to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.860
 see with the game instead this one yes this one 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.880
 has dimension 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.990
 it looks 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.810
 exactly the same and here is a new 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.080
 I for if you have a connector you can 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.310
 put behind a mini figure 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.310
 so it looks sideways 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.310
 same 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:33.989
 This is the scout finally 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.830
 his head is quite small but it is not 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.830
 a bad figure indeed is quite 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.830
 quite 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.040
 interesting 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.480
 provides a new armor design with 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.050
 the good foot we can create new 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.010
 stop-motion alone to the void 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.510
 finally the spartan 2 is the one that all 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.420
 we all know has nothing new 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.840
 the weapon that comes with it either a 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.010
 submachine gun with silencer to a shotgun 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.019
 well now let's move on to stop moria go 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.130
 detail of those of the uen is that alone 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.560
 put here a logo with 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.410
 valid redundancy a logo of the 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.760
 good is that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:31.940
 As we can see, the piece is not here 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.520
 who have the above harmony 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.220
 not even with the logo of the nfc 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.289
 and well this also brings a mine 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:48.560
 trap like several of the high ground and the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:50.900
 secure anspac egg plated 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.600
 these are the pieces brings two connectors 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.630
 there is the shotgun and it comes in a 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.129
 Green or green military color 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.679
 like the others you can also 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.009
 make more compact thanks to the 

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.009
 connectors 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.090
 good for 209 pesos can have 3 mini 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.560
 pretty pretty good figures 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.740
 and a new weapon or two or two or three in 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.180
 4 in the case you do not have any 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.030
 of these 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.300
 and well that has been all for this 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.509
