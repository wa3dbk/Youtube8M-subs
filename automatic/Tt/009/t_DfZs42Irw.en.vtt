00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.460 
under display so the first one will be
spot<00:03:36.000> where<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.360> control<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.230> this

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
spot where that control so this

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
spot where that control so this
essentially<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.129> similar<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.790> Samsung's<00:03:39.269> as

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
essentially is similar to Samsung's as

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.449 
essentially is similar to Samsung's as
much<00:03:39.690> steam<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.739> does<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:40.890> if<00:03:41.310> you're

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
much steam so what it does is if you're

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.860 
much steam so what it does is if you're
looking<00:03:41.819> at<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:41.970> device<00:03:42.269> staring<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
looking at the device staring at the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.930 
looking at the device staring at the
screen<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.230> are<00:03:43.319> cashing<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.920> touching<00:03:44.849> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
screen we are cashing the touching the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.110 
screen we are cashing the touching the
screen<00:03:45.150> we<00:03:45.900> keep<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.230> screen<00:03:47.120> illuminated

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
screen we keep the screen illuminated

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.740 
screen we keep the screen illuminated
until<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.319> look<00:03:49.470> away<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.879> is<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> new

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
until you look away so this is a new

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.069 
until you look away so this is a new
feature<00:03:51.959> from<00:03:52.170> Sony<00:03:52.849> so<00:03:53.849> it's<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.510> new<00:03:54.780> by

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
feature from Sony so it's not new by

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.759 
feature from Sony so it's not new by
such<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.680> nice<00:03:55.920> touch<00:03:56.190> or<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.090> new<00:03:57.209> model<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
such a nice touch or the new model and

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.020 
such a nice touch or the new model and
the<00:03:58.950> next<00:03:59.129> one<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.849> feature

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
the next one is that you have a feature

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.020 
the next one is that you have a feature
to<00:04:00.299> tap<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.409> wait<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.489> can<00:04:02.640> use<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
to tap to wait so you can use this to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.839 
to tap to wait so you can use this to
switch<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.930> screen<00:04:04.310> test<00:04:05.310> demonstrate
