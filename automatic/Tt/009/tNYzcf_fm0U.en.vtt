looking at the corrections at the bottom
of<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.329> screen<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:20.500> can<00:04:20.650> see<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:20.889> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
of the screen we can see that the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.060 
of the screen we can see that the
machine<00:04:21.489> has<00:04:21.729> to<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.030> down<00:04:22.440> 18.5<00:04:23.440> now<00:04:23.740> at<00:04:23.949> the

lifted by 16.5 now
with<00:04:29.620> these<00:04:29.830> results<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:30.610> say<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.090> there

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
with these results we can say that there

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.030 
with these results we can say that there
is<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.449> lot<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.720> misalignment<00:04:32.410> because<00:04:32.919> the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
is a lot of misalignment because the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.869 
is a lot of misalignment because the
machine<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.550> skewed<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.210> both<00:04:34.449> planes

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
before we begin making the corrections

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.769 
before we begin making the corrections
we<00:04:41.550> will<00:04:41.699> start<00:04:41.969> with<00:04:42.119> the<00:04:42.240> vertical<00:04:42.449> plane

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
we will start with the vertical plane

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.869 
we will start with the vertical plane
and<00:04:43.139> move<00:04:43.409> the<00:04:43.589> measuring<00:04:43.949> units<00:04:44.309> to<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.639> 12

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
and move the measuring units to the 12

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.690 
and move the measuring units to the 12
o'clock<00:04:45.059> position

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.060 

you<00:04:49.270> can<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:49.600> see<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.900> yellow<00:04:50.320> arrows<00:04:50.680> moved

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
you can now see the yellow arrows moved

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.470 
you can now see the yellow arrows moved
to<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.490> left<00:04:51.730> side<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.180> screen

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
in the vertical plane we will make the

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.800 
in the vertical plane we will make the

back end and lifting the front we do

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.810 
back end and lifting the front we do
this<00:05:02.560> by<00:05:02.800> adding<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.430> taking<00:05:03.790> away<00:05:03.910> shin<00:05:05.820> as

is<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.130> Thau<00:05:24.340> per<00:05:24.610> inch<00:05:24.790> offset<00:05:25.420> and<00:05:25.630> angle

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
is the Thau per inch offset and angle

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.330 
is the Thau per inch offset and angle
which<00:05:26.920> as<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.310> can<00:05:27.460> see<00:05:27.700> at<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.940> top<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.840> one

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
which as you can see at the top is one

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.580 
which as you can see at the top is one
thousand<00:05:30.340> zeroth<00:05:30.940> out<00:05:31.150> for<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.510> angle<00:05:31.930> which

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
thousand zeroth out for the angle which

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.010 
thousand zeroth out for the angle which
is<00:05:32.770> well<00:05:32.980> within<00:05:33.220> tolerance

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.260 

next<00:05:39.740> we<00:05:39.890> move<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.280> measuring<00:05:40.640> units<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.180> the

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
next we move the measuring units to the

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.530 
next we move the measuring units to the
nine<00:05:41.480> o'clock<00:05:41.780> position<00:05:42.320> so<00:05:42.560> they<00:05:42.710> read<00:05:42.950> live

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
nine o'clock position so they read live

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.940 
nine o'clock position so they read live
now<00:05:44.540> we<00:05:44.600> can<00:05:44.840> make<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.140> corrections<00:05:45.650> in<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
now we can make the corrections in the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.490 
now we can make the corrections in the
horizontal<00:05:46.220> plane

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.100 

the<00:05:53.980> motor<00:05:54.190> is<00:05:54.460> skewed<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:55.390> we<00:05:55.510> start<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:55.960> make

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
the motor is skewed so we start to make

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.990 
the motor is skewed so we start to make
small<00:05:56.440> adjustments<00:05:56.560> rather<00:05:57.430> than<00:05:57.670> making

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
small adjustments rather than making

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.060 
small adjustments rather than making
large<00:05:58.270> moves<00:05:58.540> which<00:05:59.350> is<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.620> best<00:05:59.830> way<00:06:00.040> to

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
large moves which is the best way to

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.830 
large moves which is the best way to
