00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.920
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.439
 channel and in this master class I will show 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 one of the options how to use 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.640
 Keynes previous video to work us 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.669
 will need polymer clay 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.689
 Keynes patterned waste remains of clay and 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.780
 round qatar 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.190
 lesia and toothpicks quarrels and delivery of 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.750
 farley lacquer tassel wet wipes 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.880
 spandex or rubber band for bracelet and 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.900
 super glue to start cut into small 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:49.880
 pieces the remains of clay and roll out and 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.120
 under the car thickness of 2 millimeters 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.290
 cut out circles for 12 beads 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.530
 I will need 24 circles of 2 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.230
 circle on each bead and roll and spirit 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.839
 bead circles 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.440
 do the same with the rest 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.470
 circles 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.370
 I got 12 beads I share on 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 several pieces 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.800
 6 beads will be with a pattern of death roads and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.780
 2 white green and black 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.940
 let's start creating beads with a pattern 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.950
 I chose a bright green background 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.230
 roll the clay and a half thick 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 millimeter wrap bead first 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.370
 the green layer is cut off by the blade 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 smooth the joint and roll the ball 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.930
 until it is natural to take all the irregularities 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.120
 blades and cut into thin strips and three 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 bunny so as not to deform the picture 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.100
 every time we turn the cane 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.850
 when cut enough 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 triangles in a chaotic manner 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.140
 attach and green ball 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.229
 and first slowly roll the bead to 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.790
 smooth edges and not deform the drawing 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.960
 when the pictures are dense in order well 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 roll beads 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.760
 to smooth all irregularities bead 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.250
 must be perfectly flat then 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.090
 scroll bead hands pierce it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.090
 web cleaning 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.980
 but 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 but 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.220
 so we twisted the bead in our hands the white color 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.110
 got a little greenish to this 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.200
 fix wipe our drawing 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.520
 wet wipes do the same thing and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.520
 stream 5 beads 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.120
 Now we are making an ordinary bead with Alena 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.830
 technology roll thick 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.220
 one and a half millimeter we wrap the workpiece 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 for beads and cut off the excess and roll 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.640
 ball 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.960
 after all the beads are ready 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.120
 we roll them in salt 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.970
 cuddling for lady length to good 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.340
 imprinted texture 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.440
 and scroll the beads in my hands and such 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.660
 a toothpick when all the beads are ready 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.180
 managed to bake for 20 minutes at 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.040
 temperature one hundred and ten degrees after 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.130
 roasting when the beads are still warm 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.110
 remove their toothpicks otherwise 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.250
 it will be left to do very 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.890
 warm up Now Putin and salt 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.760
 immerse the warm water and wait seem 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.760
 stayed 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.470
 after that we bloom napkin beads 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.470
 to remove excess moisture 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.850
 and cover the beads with a pattern and glossy 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.850
 varnish in two layers 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.250
 and start picking alternating beads with 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.250
 patterned and plain 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.390
 bracelet with rubber cord or spandex 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.900
 1 and Kalmyk 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.769
 you are the home of your heart and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.769
 the blind side 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 for a few knots and dripping super glue 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.760
 and hide the bundle of beads 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.139
 and our bracelet is ready as a drawing 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.600
 black and white you can combine any 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.600
 colors and combine with any beads 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.480
 but I hope that this master class to you 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.490
 I like it and I suggest you look 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.950

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 stupid not death and bracelets with books 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.030
