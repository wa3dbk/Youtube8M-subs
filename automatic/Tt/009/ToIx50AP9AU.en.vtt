00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.550
 good good day today I'm going to do 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.980
 made a product with quince makes 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.920
 several days to personar bullying is a 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.369
 telephoto with lenses with a lens a 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.869
 zoom magnifier by 12 for and Welsh 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.029
 and 4 of equal the model that is since 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.279
 then take that can be achieved that 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.740
 4 can be realized from this small 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.260
 Not good product superior over 17 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.140
 euros around about 24 dollars the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.820
 truth is not at all expensive and then the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.650
 who like to take their photos with their 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.030
 phone is pretty cool because not 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.070
 you want to increase the nothing else and good 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.630
 this one looks pretty clear and pretty 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.430
 alright then we're not going to leave so that 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.870
 we will go very quickly what 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.090
 has between the box of a box 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.160
 quite tough man and shore 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.050
 I tried it that you can see is the box 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 here first since we have the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.180
 lens right away with your 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 cover and everything 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 there is also with this little boy who is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.060
 a little angel for the little boy to put it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.549
 in a base on a small tripod that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 comes here comes in what is the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.520
 cover here we have a tripod 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.799
 the aluminum also quite stable 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 little one where we want to put ourselves 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.310
 in the lens 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.000
 come to us a cleaner cited a chamois 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.950
 to clean the screen or clean the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.409
 the objective lens here a small 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 how to how to put it and good manual 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.740
 as more or less as they see it there 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 it would be more or less as if they put phone 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.890
 since it says a little bit like 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.780
 who after a sample more or less 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.509
 of what about we are not going to leave that 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.159
 here also and here is not what 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.320
 that the charge quotes in a fund 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.789
 quite sure the little head we are going to 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.649
 put our four galaxies equal 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.840
 it involves a thread here and the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.140
 we will put here in the good east all the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 assembly plus do that is the simple 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 let's open here we have some 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 talks also if we want we open it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.810
 quite sturdy cas 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.760
 we open it and then because here we will have the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.330
 ball to put what is the objective 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.330
 let's uncover what 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 i 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.770
 here we see it here and we have what is the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.480
 to put the molten ball is here 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.750
 [Music] 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 and here we have the other one of the sun we have 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.879
 some pictures and the differences so to see 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.599
 how do you see we do not see the phone 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.599
 first of all here 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.960
 impressed and then we can give 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.960
 returns here 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.640
 by twisting and as you can see already 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.100
 I want 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.380
 get out of the scream 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.890
 and then you need to see how the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.810
 phone the photos but to dry 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.810
 pretty stable because it would be here not 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.390
 [Music] 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.390
 here the practices to turn around 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.230
 let's put it like that at that height 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.849
 and we are going to press it here 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.849
 they do not move at all 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.370
 and here we will put the base 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.660
 is the base of vitoria we will open the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.650
 legs again 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.650
 and a little side 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.460
 here we put it we would have our 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.460
 lens here we will see 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.260
 how are you going to see it once we put it 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.260
 already for the photos 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.150
 the assistant we can put it then we 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.729
 we wash here so that the weight of the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.340
 counterweight then do and so do not move 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.830
 for anything good that's how you would see the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.200
 objective here very s 4 I have the one of 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.270
 the part of the camera 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.490
 and here we have the objective there 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.050
 lens if we want to regulate it up 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.510
 horizontally because it would only 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.660
 just regulate here the donut and 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.270
 move what you can see is quite 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.410
 rigid is pretty cool and good 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.090
 let's see a little bit what it would be like to see 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.060
 how would it be that it works as you can see 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.430
 Here is a bush and in the distance the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.680
 taste that is focusing here 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.200
 there it is and you can see the bush that 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.390
 the phone equipment focused 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.490
 pretty good in some cases then there 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.550
 are in your possession one if we put it in 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.640
 he is butt they are by four 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.230
 there is more or less what it would look like in 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.420
 some images so they can see the 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.850
 normal phone and with the objective as 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.190
 would be zoomed in by one there has it not 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.510
 I know what I will do as it would look normal without 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.120
 no kind of that we can already take 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.080
 our picture right there she can 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 visualize it 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.640
 but then I hope you like it 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.830
 You already know that if you are interested in this 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.940
 product or in many similar to 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.980
 Jennifer beaujean then we can 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.140
 get freedom for they were pretty 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.950
 cheap and good greetings to everyone in 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.950
 another next video
