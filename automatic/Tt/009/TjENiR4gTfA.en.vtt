00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 and well let's start already obviously already 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.940
 is open because I wanted to know what 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.670
 they had brought us not because they could 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.990
 could be very different things and 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.520
 Well since I've seen and I've

 here we will vary the good we see that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.960
 they give us how it's worth or this for pc 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.180
 components that do not help us at all 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.940
 they also give us good because the paper 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.699
 of shipping and everything and well then here 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.480
 let's see what they have brought us that not 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.449
 it's little 'okay, we 're going to take it out and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.130
 I will show you that there is nothing else 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.560
 simply that there is then that is worth it here 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.620
 there's nothing else there are papers and shits 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.630
 it's worth they are useless 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.930
 so we 'll leave it here and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.320
 We would take this, what is this, then? 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.770
 good is a keyboard and mouse pack like 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.020
 You see it's the shepherd pack of the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.570
 cooler master is as you see here that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.000
 put web here that puts cooler master 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.610
 It is worth as you see it is keyboard and mouse 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.940
 which is the buster keyboard and mouse 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.250
 It's good for gaming and well, it's this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.340

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.080
 that brings this pack will also bring 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.560
 well I'll put it to yourself so that what 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.100
 you can see how I open them here and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.390
 now here 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 and what we would see is perfect what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.830
 we'll put it like that and let's open I'll 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.410
 to show how you see how I put the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.569
 keyboard and mouse as you see constant 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.270
 at the moment you can not see anything because you see 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.630
 all black but first let's take out the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.170
 mouse over here, you are seeing it if 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.450
 it is perfect 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.730
 is worth 6 this is the mouse a while in the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.489
 true that very very very good 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
 quite pretty pretty, as you see 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.650
 the interface that takes us then is very 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
 good with two buttons over here 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.260
 random and another one over here that is 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.600
 to control 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.670
 the sensitivity of our well of 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.500
 our mouse is worth the sensitivity for 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.959
 the game of for then for the computer 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.260
 itself of our computer is worth as 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.420
 you see 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.420
 He is quite handsome 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.560
 this would be the mouse let's leave it for 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.310
 here and now we would take the keyboard 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.280
 What is the jewel in the crown? 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.069
 keyboard is the jewel in the crown we are going to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.170
 leave it here you will not see that no 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.709
 there's nothing else you sell the whole box such 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.470
 which and these are for a few planes 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.670
 worth the other thor and the guide and such 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.360
 but that the oven is going to need it 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.790
 for nothing like this is another that you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.630
 indicates that that backlit project 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.160
 is the keyboard and well, as you see 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.470
 tells us that by this key it is 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.549
 turn everything on with this we 're already going 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.350
 to leave it here and let's take 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.269
 our piece keyboard and you'd better 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.380
 I will teach the specifications so much 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.800
 of the mouse like him 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.360
 of the super keyboard that comes to us this is 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.120
 the super keyboard as you see doing the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.460
 specifications vale is a keyboard of 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.250
 personalized membrane is to say that it is 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.010
 between membrane and the mechanical as you go 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.340
 see the sound is worth almost mechanical 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.340
 look 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.200

 I have the micro here is a sound almost of 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.220
 mechanical is worth a very very very sound 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.710
 good and the truth is that the keys then 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.290
 Well they go up and down very fast worth 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.750

 backlit with 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.570
 with blue it's worth this key here 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.390
 it's worth this key because it turns on and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.970
