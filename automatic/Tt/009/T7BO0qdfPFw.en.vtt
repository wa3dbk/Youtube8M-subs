barrels like I did a few years ago
sometimes<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.170> big<00:00:19.320> gringo<00:00:19.560> starts<00:00:19.830> off

a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.660> not<00:00:21.660> super<00:00:21.990> Hollow<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> little

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
a little not super Hollow it's a little

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.439 
a little not super Hollow it's a little
tricky<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.000> once<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> get

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
tricky to get into it but once you get

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.849 
tricky to get into it but once you get
into<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.199> kind<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.439> start<00:00:25.650> weaving

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
into it you can kind of start weaving

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.970 
into it you can kind of start weaving
through<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:27.740> challenges<00:00:28.740> your

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
through it and actually challenges your

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.130 
through it and actually challenges your
your<00:00:29.820> tube<00:00:30.000> riding<00:00:30.269> ability<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:30.960> i<00:00:31.080> think

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
your tube riding ability which i think

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
your tube riding ability which i think
is<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.439> good<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.850> your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
is really good you know in just your

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.250 
is really good you know in just your
whole<00:00:33.120> control<00:00:33.510> throughout<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> whole<00:00:34.079> wave

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
whole control throughout the whole wave

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
whole control throughout the whole wave
it's<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.739> pretty<00:00:34.890> challenging<00:00:35.160> wave<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.000> ride

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it's a pretty challenging wave to ride

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.479 
it's a pretty challenging wave to ride
it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.930> perfect<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> whole<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's not just perfect the whole way it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.340 
it's not just perfect the whole way it
kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.820> does<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.360> through<00:00:39.570> different<00:00:39.750> shapes

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
kind of does go through different shapes

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.740 
kind of does go through different shapes
as<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.800> moving<00:00:40.920> down<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> reef<00:00:41.629> but<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
as it's moving down the reef but it's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
as it's moving down the reef but it's
it's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.170> great<00:00:43.290> body<00:00:43.559> wedding<00:00:43.829> wave<00:00:43.950> well<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it's a great body wedding wave well the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's a great body wedding wave well the
event<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> year<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.420> every<00:00:45.840> year<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
event this year I think every year it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
event this year I think every year it
seems<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.530> keeps<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.579> bar<00:00:47.760> keeps

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
seems like it keeps the bar keeps

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
seems like it keeps the bar keeps
getting<00:00:48.300> raised<00:00:48.510> higher<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> higher<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.460> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
getting raised higher and higher and a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.119 
getting raised higher and higher and a
lot<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.420> top<00:00:52.140> contenders<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.890> knocked

and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> guy<00:01:37.950> catches<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> wave

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and you know if the guy catches a wave

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.249 
and you know if the guy catches a wave
then<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:38.880> loses<00:01:39.030> priority<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.810> paddles<00:01:40.140> for

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
then he loses priority or paddles for

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.080 
then he loses priority or paddles for
wavy<00:01:40.439> he<00:01:40.619> loses<00:01:40.860> his<00:01:40.979> chance<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.790> goes<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
wavy he loses his chance and it goes to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
wavy he loses his chance and it goes to
the<00:01:42.150> next<00:01:42.329> guy<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.509> line<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> takes<00:01:43.920> out

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the next guy in line and so it takes out

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.240 
the next guy in line and so it takes out
a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.520> hassling<00:01:45.000> aspect<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
a lot of the hassling aspect of

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.289 
a lot of the hassling aspect of
competition<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.119> good

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
competition which which is really good

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.630 
competition which which is really good
the<00:01:48.899> technical<00:01:49.380> level<00:01:49.500> has<00:01:49.770> seen<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.369> really

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the technical level has seen it's really

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.460 
the technical level has seen it's really
good<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.570> keep<00:01:51.899> continually

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
good to see it's keep continually

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.789 
good to see it's keep continually
improving<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.899> as<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> result<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
improving and as a result of that it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
improving and as a result of that it
just<00:01:55.829> pushes<00:01:56.280> everyone<00:01:56.520> else<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just pushes everyone else to be that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
just pushes everyone else to be that
much<00:01:57.299> better<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
much better and that's kind of what you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.870 
much better and that's kind of what you
want<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.189> competition<00:01:59.700> guys

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
want to see in a competition guys

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.899 
want to see in a competition guys
pushing<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.460> places<00:02:02.880> that

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pushing it and you know to places that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
pushing it and you know to places that
are<00:02:03.210> beyond<00:02:03.930> their<00:02:04.049> comfort<00:02:04.259> levels<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
are beyond their comfort levels and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.580 
are beyond their comfort levels and
beyond<00:02:05.759> their<00:02:05.880> abilities<00:02:06.299> even<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.380> lot<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
beyond their abilities even in a lot of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.100 
beyond their abilities even in a lot of
cases<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:09.060> where

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
cases in the that's where

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.220 
cases in the that's where
things<00:02:10.380> are<00:02:10.530> found<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.750> new<00:02:12.750> techniques

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
things are found and new techniques

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.560 
things are found and new techniques
developed<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.850> mean<00:02:15.150> that's<00:02:15.270> part<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
developed so I mean that's part of the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.700 
developed so I mean that's part of the
reason<00:02:15.720> why<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.870> still<00:02:16.110> compete<00:02:16.410> because<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
reason why I still compete because it

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.710 
reason why I still compete because it
kind<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> really<00:02:17.130> motivates<00:02:17.520> me<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> push

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
kind of really motivates me to push

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.180 
kind of really motivates me to push
myself<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.380> further<00:02:19.590> than<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.800> would<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.070> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
myself a lot further than I would if I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.180 
myself a lot further than I would if I
was<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.460> going<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.790> free<00:02:20.970> surf
