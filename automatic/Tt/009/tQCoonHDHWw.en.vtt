00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.320
 friends of andrea the blog always from 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.680
 stand out of mahjong 2006 this time 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.290
 in the company of the top of the range of 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.099
 gamma jason presented by asus we talk 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.169
 of 66 which takes its name like the others 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.380
 two from the diagonal of the iblei to make them 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.269
 we always have 6 inches of cases 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.679
 resolution let's see anyway 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.710
 as in the front does not change 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:32.899
 practically nothing compared to the terminals 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.780
 lower range ie 5 and 4 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.730
 while at the rear level we are 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.520
 however with a speaker grill 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.730
 much wider than the previous one 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.220
 and the camera that this time is not from 8 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.010
 but well from 13 megapixels 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.040
 also in the case of zen with 6 we have 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 in integration with low light mode 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.050
 which increases by 400 per cent 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.360
 brightness in the picture this display can 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.940
 also be used with the mode 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.560
 gloves a display that is still by eye 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.659
 looks really very nice despite the 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.509
 resolution can obviously not high 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.749
 that's the processors that move this 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.740
 time if like the others, ginger is always 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:19.670
 a pole an atom this time the z 25 80 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 clocked at 2gb of ram and in this case 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.360
 is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 from a gb of ram but when a card 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 video is also marked the 2 2 GB of ram e 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.840
 so I don't know if it is present in others 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 markets we will investigate this on this 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 what the storage is instead of 16 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.860
 gigabytes more and the expansion slot for 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 the micro sd 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 the front camera instead is 2 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 megapixels and the battery built into the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.580
 body always very beautiful of this zen 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.650
 phone and 3.300 took place 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.310
 family for now this time however it is not 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.700
 removable let's go you have a moment 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.410
 other characteristics 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.800
 the interface is always the sen 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.800
 they told us it's called so that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.630
 I really liked it a lot 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.430
 then we enter the settings of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.500
 terminal meanwhile we can appreciate the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780
 speed of this act in opening i 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.210
 menu we don't have a minimum delay e 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.700
 android is always version 4.3 but 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.180
 on technical specifications and clearly 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
 having said that it will be updated by the 4.4 kit 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.190
 kat 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.750
 let's go back to see the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.840
 history of if we confirm how much 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.610
 written on 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:44.590
 on the technical sheet and therefore on this 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.300
 let's see there are at 5.09 so this is it 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.340
 a model probably with a bang 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.519
 gigabyte let's assume a variation in 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.590
 based on the markets also in this in 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.599
 this time the dimensions this time 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.720
 we must mention them are important because 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:07.390
 for a 6 inches as they are 166 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:11.260
 point 9 84 point 35.5 mm thick e 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.799
 see for example the comparison with lg 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.010
 g2 which however is a 5.2 inch la 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.079
 size difference anyway 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.450
 important despite the shape of a little 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.000
 jarred of the rear yes and allows 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.810
 hold this terminal in your hand 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.910
 unfortunately the pieces of these zen phones by 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.319
 the whole range have not yet been 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.720
 announced by we will fail to inform you 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.060
 promptly as soon as we know something 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.849
 more maybe in the next few hours 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 also for the iPhone 6 so we have 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.010
 seen a fast floured like 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.680
 we can also see the applications 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.810
 implemented by never asus tools 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.720
 capable powersavers to optimize the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.930
 battery a set up a wizard and the web 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 storage is now classic asus e 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.080
 anything else classic can feel 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.510
 then integrated into a new interface 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.860
 also on zen phone 6 we gave 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.980
 look at the main ones 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.560
 features and zen phone range that 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.709
 however we liked it at the level of 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.500
 design aesthetics and usability 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.020
 general and for this preview it's all 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.600
 for now from my world congress is a 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.600
 salute of alessio for androidblog.it
