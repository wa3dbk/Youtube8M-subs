00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.470 

hello<00:00:02.100> everyone<00:00:02.460> so<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.850> last<00:00:02.970> episode<00:00:03.149> we

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hello everyone so in the last episode we

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.780 
hello everyone so in the last episode we
made<00:00:03.600> it<00:00:03.689> possible<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.110> place<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.529> object

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790 
made it possible to place this object

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.450 
made it possible to place this object
but<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.720> was<00:00:06.899> kind<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.109> just<00:00:07.460> arbitrary

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
but it it was kind of just arbitrary

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040 
but it it was kind of just arbitrary
we're<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> go<00:00:09.540> ahead<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.780> do<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> little

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
we're going to go ahead and do a little

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.959 
we're going to go ahead and do a little
bit<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.230> work<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.679> today<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
bit of work on that today one of the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.999 
bit of work on that today one of the
things<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.389> did<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.440> made<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
things that I did is I made it so that

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919 
things that I did is I made it so that
the<00:00:14.160> object<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.700> were<00:00:14.849> placing<00:00:15.330> which<00:00:15.690> was

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the object we were placing which was

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.529 
the object we were placing which was
this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.440> now<00:00:16.830> inside<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.699> another<00:00:17.789> object<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this is now inside of another object and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.730 
this is now inside of another object and
the<00:00:18.600> only<00:00:18.720> reason<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.470> i

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the only reason for that is because i

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.609 
the only reason for that is because i
want<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.980> rotation<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> be<00:00:20.520> 000<00:00:21.439> I've<00:00:22.439> also

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
want the rotation to be 000 I've also

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
want the rotation to be 000 I've also
created<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.340> rigid<00:00:23.609> body<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.119> object<00:00:24.330> with

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
created a rigid body on this object with

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820 
created a rigid body on this object with
a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:26.090> movement<00:00:27.090> drag<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> I'm

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a little bit of movement drag and I'm

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
a little bit of movement drag and I'm
freeze<00:00:29.220> Rose<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> rotation<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> problem

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
freeze Rose the rotation now the problem

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.569 
freeze Rose the rotation now the problem
you're<00:00:31.679> probably<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> run<00:00:32.250> into<00:00:32.340> real

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you're probably going to run into real

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.680 
you're probably going to run into real
quick<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.360> looks<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:34.640> unity<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.210> having<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
quick is it looks like unity is having a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170 
quick is it looks like unity is having a
tough<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:37.070> with<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.399> mesh<00:00:38.610> colliders<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
tough time with two mesh colliders I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.430 
tough time with two mesh colliders I
can't<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> work<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.290> two

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
can't get it to work when there's two

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
can't get it to work when there's two
mesh<00:00:40.649> colliders<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> make

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
mesh colliders so we're going to make

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.690 
mesh colliders so we're going to make
this<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.690> simple<00:00:43.649> box<00:00:44.040> Collider<00:00:44.489> instead

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
this a very simple box Collider instead

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
this a very simple box Collider instead
like<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.989> won't<00:00:49.200> matter<00:00:49.320> much<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:50.039> our

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
like so that won't matter much from our

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.920 
like so that won't matter much from our
perspective<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.329> doing<00:00:51.629> much

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
perspective but if you are doing much

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.330 
perspective but if you are doing much
more<00:00:52.110> complicated<00:00:52.410> meshes<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.250> have

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
more complicated meshes you might have

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.080 
more complicated meshes you might have
to<00:00:53.430> figure<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.699> why<00:00:54.980> why<00:00:55.980> unity<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.579> decided

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to figure out why why unity has decided

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
to figure out why why unity has decided
that<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> let<00:00:58.260> me<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that it's not going to let me do that I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.029 
that it's not going to let me do that I
tried<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.730> about<00:00:59.879> ten<00:01:00.059> minutes<00:01:00.770> could<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
tried for about ten minutes could get to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.509 
tried for about ten minutes could get to
work<00:01:02.420> now<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> should<00:01:03.780> though<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.430> next

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
work now it should though so the next

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.530 
work now it should though so the next
thing<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> need<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> create

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
thing we need to do is we need to create

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.600 
thing we need to do is we need to create
a<00:01:06.630> script<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.439> our<00:01:07.710> new<00:01:08.070> kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> object

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
a script for our new kind of object

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 
a script for our new kind of object
which<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.330> droppable<00:01:09.900> module<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.729> we're

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
which is a droppable module and we're

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
which is a droppable module and we're
going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.150> ahead<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> put<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:13.140> with

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
going to go ahead and put that out with

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to go ahead and put that out with
that<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> deleted<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> screen<00:01:15.180> just

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that I deleted it from the screen just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
that I deleted it from the screen just
as<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.720> needed<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.100> brilliant<00:01:19.880> droppable

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
as I needed it brilliant droppable

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
as I needed it brilliant droppable
module<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.220> find<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> pixel<00:01:23.670> where

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
module here it is find the pixel where

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
module here it is find the pixel where
lets<00:01:24.000> me<00:01:24.090> add<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.540> open<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> we

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
lets me add it and open it up here so we

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
lets me add it and open it up here so we
want<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> droppable<00:01:29.189> module<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.850> actually

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
want the droppable module to actually

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
want the droppable module to actually
fall<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.110> we're<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.799> ahead<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.280> move

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
fall so we're going to go ahead and move

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:43.440 
fall so we're going to go ahead and move
it<00:01:32.850> upwards<00:01:33.090> after<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.810> been<00:01:33.960> placed

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.020 

like<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.660> and<00:01:45.160> in<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.310> way<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.610> should<00:01:46.790> fall

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
like that and in that way it should fall

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.140 
like that and in that way it should fall
from<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.390> sky<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.310> did<00:01:49.610> have<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.970> actually

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
from the sky now I did have to actually

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.770 
from the sky now I did have to actually
I<00:01:51.140> did<00:01:51.920> go<00:01:52.340> ahead<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.640> set<00:01:52.910> this<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
I did go ahead and set this to the the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.080 
I did go ahead and set this to the the
way<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.440> it's<00:01:54.590> correct<00:01:54.770> where<00:01:55.190> this<00:01:55.850> used<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
way that it's correct where this used to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.450 
way that it's correct where this used to
be<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:56.390> lines<00:01:56.630> now<00:01:56.869> it's<00:01:57.050> just<00:01:57.200> one<00:01:57.430> it's<00:01:58.430> just

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
be two lines now it's just one it's just

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.040 
be two lines now it's just one it's just
a<00:01:58.640> minor<00:01:58.910> thing<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.390> doesn't<00:01:59.990> actually

a minor thing that doesn't actually

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.719 
a minor thing that doesn't actually
change<00:02:00.260> how<00:02:00.619> anything<00:02:00.890> works<00:02:01.160> it's<00:02:01.400> just<00:02:01.490> how

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
change how anything works it's just how

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.240 
change how anything works it's just how
I<00:02:01.760> prefer<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:04.970> hit<00:02:05.360> space<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.250> weight

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
I prefer it so a hit space and weight

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:17.980 
I prefer it so a hit space and weight
and<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:08.060> comes<00:02:08.300> Luke<00:02:09.110> there<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.830> go

but<00:02:23.810> can't<00:02:24.290> if<00:02:24.950> we<00:02:25.159> actually<00:02:25.579> are<00:02:25.670> careful<00:02:26.120> we

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
but can't if we actually are careful we

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.910 
but can't if we actually are careful we
should<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.049> able<00:02:27.109> to<00:02:27.260> click<00:02:27.379> on<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> ground

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
should be able to click on the ground

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.619 
should be able to click on the ground
close<00:02:28.310> enough<00:02:28.609> to<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:29.000> those<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.510> they

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
close enough to one of those that they

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.110 
close enough to one of those that they
land<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:29.959> top<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.319> each<00:02:30.409> other<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.969> you<00:02:31.969> can

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
land on top of each other and you can

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.880 
land on top of each other and you can
see<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.329> they<00:02:32.450> bounce<00:02:32.719> they<00:02:33.349> also<00:02:33.560> get

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
see that they bounce they also get

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.259 
see that they bounce they also get
stomped<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.670> hell<00:02:35.060> when<00:02:35.359> we<00:02:35.480> run<00:02:35.629> across<00:02:35.780> them

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
stomped to hell when we run across them

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.399 
stomped to hell when we run across them
I'll<00:02:38.269> actually<00:02:38.750> we<00:02:38.870> get<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.109> we<00:02:39.140> get<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.349> little

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
I'll actually we get it we get a little

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.750 
I'll actually we get it we get a little
bit<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.680> height<00:02:39.859> so<00:02:40.159> we<00:02:40.280> actually<00:02:40.400> don't<00:02:40.609> hit

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
bit of height so we actually don't hit

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.250 
bit of height so we actually don't hit
them<00:02:40.879> quite<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.150> hard<00:02:41.299> as<00:02:41.359> we<00:02:41.480> could<00:02:41.629> but<00:02:42.139> you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
them quite as hard as we could but you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.289 
them quite as hard as we could but you
can<00:02:42.349> say<00:02:42.439> we<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.650> kick<00:02:42.829> them<00:02:42.859> around<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.489> I'll

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
can say we can kick them around and I'll

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.000 
can say we can kick them around and I'll
right<00:02:44.599> now<00:02:44.750> that's<00:02:44.989> actually<00:02:45.349> how<00:02:45.469> I<00:02:45.500> want<00:02:45.859> it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
right now that's actually how I want it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.830 
right now that's actually how I want it
later<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.310> we'll<00:02:46.549> probably<00:02:46.760> optimize<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.659> so

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
later on we'll probably optimize it so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.899 
later on we'll probably optimize it so
that<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.230> physics<00:02:48.799> don't<00:02:49.069> get<00:02:49.400> simulated

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
that the physics don't get simulated

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.539 
that the physics don't get simulated
quite<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.299> aggressively<00:02:51.139> but<00:02:52.099> for<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:52.310> this

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
quite so aggressively but for now this

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.530 
quite so aggressively but for now this
is<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:52.819> good<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.239> one<00:02:53.359> of<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.510> other

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
is really good is one of the other

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.789 
is really good is one of the other
things<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.989> does<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.620> will

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
things that does is it will

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.640 
things that does is it will

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.319 

can't<00:03:09.079> look<00:03:09.230> down<00:03:09.379> quite<00:03:09.739> far<00:03:09.980> enough<00:03:10.099> that<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
can't look down quite far enough that I

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.580 
can't look down quite far enough that I
make<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.200> things<00:03:12.319> we're<00:03:12.409> going<00:03:12.500> to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
make a one of the things we're going to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.520 
make a one of the things we're going to
do<00:03:12.739> soon<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.310> make<00:03:13.639> it<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:13.909> that<00:03:14.030> i<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.269> zoom<00:03:14.629> in

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
do soon is make it so that i can zoom in

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.990 
do soon is make it so that i can zoom in
and<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:15.739> with<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.069> camera<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.639> should<00:03:16.939> have

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
and out with the camera I should have

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.369 
and out with the camera I should have
done<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.480> long<00:03:17.629> time<00:03:17.689> ago<00:03:17.900> i<00:03:18.139> don't<00:03:18.319> know

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
done that a long time ago i don't know

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.190 
done that a long time ago i don't know
why<00:03:18.560> i<00:03:18.620> haven't<00:03:19.010> still<00:03:19.310> done<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:20.079> there<00:03:21.079> we<00:03:21.169> are

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
why i haven't still done it there we are

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.110 
why i haven't still done it there we are
so<00:03:21.859> that's<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.159> for<00:03:22.189> today<00:03:22.519> they<00:03:22.700> now<00:03:22.819> fall

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
so that's it for today they now fall

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.209 
so that's it for today they now fall
from<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.389> sky<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.469> the<00:03:24.560> next<00:03:24.709> episode

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:25.219 
from the sky and in the next episode

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.740 
from the sky and in the next episode
maybe<00:03:25.519> we'll<00:03:25.730> get<00:03:25.819> onto<00:03:26.060> inventories<00:03:26.599> or

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
maybe we'll get onto inventories or

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.509 
maybe we'll get onto inventories or
maybe<00:03:27.049> i'll<00:03:27.229> fix<00:03:27.560> our<00:03:27.709> camera<00:03:28.069> up<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.310> little

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
maybe i'll fix our camera up a little

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.280 
maybe i'll fix our camera up a little
bit<00:03:28.639> haven't<00:03:29.030> decided<00:03:29.329> there's<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.109> lot<00:03:30.260> of

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
bit haven't decided there's a lot of

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.479 
bit haven't decided there's a lot of
stuff<00:03:30.530> left<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.799> do<00:03:30.949> and<00:03:30.979> it's<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.459> matter

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
stuff left to do and it's just a matter

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.879 
stuff left to do and it's just a matter
of<00:03:31.729> which<00:03:31.909> order<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:32.209> do<00:03:32.389> things<00:03:32.629> in<00:03:32.889> obviously

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
of which order we do things in obviously

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.170 
of which order we do things in obviously
have<00:03:34.010> radically<00:03:34.430> decreased<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:35.000> view

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
have radically decreased the view

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.920 
have radically decreased the view
distance<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.750> for<00:03:35.930> testing<00:03:36.199> purposes

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
distance just for testing purposes

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.979 
distance just for testing purposes
alright<00:03:38.930> see<00:03:39.169> you<00:03:39.229> see<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.680> next<00:03:39.799> time
