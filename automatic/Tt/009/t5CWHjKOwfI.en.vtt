baking soda baking powder do you know

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:15.020 
baking soda baking powder do you know
the<00:00:02.610> difference<00:00:03.060> I'm<00:00:03.300> gonna<00:00:03.510> show<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:14.030> we

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the difference I'm gonna show you we

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.670 
the difference I'm gonna show you we
know<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> difference<00:00:15.630> between<00:00:15.719> baking<00:00:16.199> soda

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
know the difference between baking soda

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.099 
know the difference between baking soda
and<00:00:17.100> baking<00:00:17.130> powder<00:00:17.550> well<00:00:18.390> there's<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> big

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and baking powder well there's a big

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
and baking powder well there's a big
difference<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.039> calcium<00:00:20.580> carbonate

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
difference this is calcium carbonate

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
difference this is calcium carbonate
it's<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.779> naturally<00:00:22.350> occurring<00:00:22.769> substance<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it's a naturally occurring substance and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.480 
it's a naturally occurring substance and
it's<00:00:24.150> got<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> uses<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.740> baking<00:00:26.220> powder

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it's got a lot of uses now baking powder

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's got a lot of uses now baking powder
it<00:00:27.029> has<00:00:27.090> baking<00:00:27.689> soda<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.949> used

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it has baking soda in it and it's used

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
it has baking soda in it and it's used
principally<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.170> baking<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.679> let's<00:00:31.890> focus<00:00:32.099> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
principally for baking so let's focus on

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
principally for baking so let's focus on
baking<00:00:32.790> soda<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> lot<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
baking soda because there's a lot of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
baking soda because there's a lot of
ways<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.380> use<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.680> around<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> house<00:00:35.160> one

there together it's nice taste let it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
there together it's nice taste let it
sit<00:01:31.680> overnight<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.460> loosen<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.659> and

sit overnight and loosen all that up and
make<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.290> much<00:01:34.439> easier<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
make it so much easier now one of the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
make it so much easier now one of the
things<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:36.360> great<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.600> baking<00:01:37.259> soda<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
things that's great about baking soda is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.550 
things that's great about baking soda is
that<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.659> base<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that it's actually a base and when you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.670 
that it's actually a base and when you
combine<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.850> acid<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:43.020> effervesces

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
combine it with an acid it effervesces

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
combine it with an acid it effervesces
and<00:01:44.040> creates<00:01:44.369> carbon<00:01:44.850> dioxide<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and creates carbon dioxide when it was a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
and creates carbon dioxide when it was a
kid<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.860> love<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.090> make

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
kid but I would love to do if to make

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
kid but I would love to do if to make
volcanoes<00:01:48.930> let<00:01:49.170> me<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.409> show<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.619> cuz<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
volcanoes let me just show you cuz this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.950 
volcanoes let me just show you cuz this
is<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.640> happens<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> cook<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
is what happens when you cook with it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.039 
is what happens when you cook with it
here's<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.649> base<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.390> calculate<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.840> take

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
here's your base the calculate you take

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050 
here's your base the calculate you take
something<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.409> vinegar<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> add<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
something like vinegar and you add it to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.800 
something like vinegar and you add it to
it<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.990> whoa<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it look at that whoa so what you see is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.020 
it look at that whoa so what you see is
you're<00:02:01.259> creating<00:02:01.740> carbon<00:02:02.130> dioxide<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.880> all

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you're creating carbon dioxide so all

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.370 
you're creating carbon dioxide so all
those<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.360> bubbles<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.930> coming<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
those little bubbles are coming up and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.690 
those little bubbles are coming up and
when<00:02:04.500> my<00:02:04.590> grandmother<00:02:05.040> used<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> make<00:02:05.340> corn

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
when my grandmother used to make corn

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
when my grandmother used to make corn
bread<00:02:05.759> she<00:02:06.420> would<00:02:06.570> use<00:02:06.899> buttermilk<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
bread she would use buttermilk and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.699 
bread she would use buttermilk and
baking<00:02:08.610> soda<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> simmer

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
baking soda and you get the simmer

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.770 
baking soda and you get the simmer
and<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.819> bubbles<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.420> carbon

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and the little bubbles the carbon

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.569 
and the little bubbles the carbon
dioxide<00:02:12.930> would<00:02:13.439> rise<00:02:13.709> up<00:02:14.010> through<00:02:14.219> the<00:02:14.340> batter

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
dioxide would rise up through the batter

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.050 
dioxide would rise up through the batter
and<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:14.909> would<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.290> bread<00:02:16.920> rise<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and that would make the bread rise so

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.910 
and that would make the bread rise so
you<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.599> there's<00:02:18.900> lots<00:02:19.079> of<00:02:19.290> uses<00:02:19.530> for

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you can see there's lots of uses for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.399 
you can see there's lots of uses for
baking<00:02:20.310> soda<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.420> liked<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:21.810> tip<00:02:22.109> and

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
baking soda if you liked this tip and

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.170 
baking soda if you liked this tip and
others<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.280> use<00:02:23.579> around<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.969> house
