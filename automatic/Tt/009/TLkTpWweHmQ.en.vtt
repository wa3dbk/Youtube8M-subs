he did against cow on this map I
predicted<00:00:50.540> that<00:00:50.600> we'd<00:00:50.809> be<00:00:50.960> seeing<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.440> lot<00:00:51.470> of

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
predicted that we'd be seeing a lot of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.590 
predicted that we'd be seeing a lot of
interesting<00:00:52.250> strategies<00:00:52.670> starting<00:00:53.420> with<00:00:53.480> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
interesting strategies starting with the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.220 
interesting strategies starting with the
last<00:00:53.809> match<00:00:54.020> put<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> last<00:00:54.620> match<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:56.110> mean<00:00:57.110> he

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
last match put the last match I mean he

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.299 
last match put the last match I mean he
definitely<00:00:57.350> had<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.710> difference<00:00:58.220> in

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
definitely had a difference in

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.920 
definitely had a difference in
strategies<00:00:58.790> but<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.090> didn't<00:00:59.330> see<00:00:59.420> any<00:00:59.450> kind<00:00:59.809> of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
strategies but we didn't see any kind of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.470 
strategies but we didn't see any kind of
cheese<00:01:00.470> proxy<00:01:00.920> or<00:01:01.070> anything<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.400> that<00:01:01.580> no

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
early push with a lot of gateways or

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.840 
early push with a lot of gateways or
anything<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.350> we'll<00:01:07.010> see<00:01:07.190> what<00:01:07.400> happens<00:01:07.520> in

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
anything so we'll see what happens in

this match bisous he's going to be a lot

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.970 
this match bisous he's going to be a lot
more<00:01:11.240> confident<00:01:11.930> after<00:01:12.080> that<00:01:12.380> win<00:01:12.650> because

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
more confident after that win because

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.580 
more confident after that win because
he's<00:01:13.850> been<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.210> finals<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.690> lot<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.170> he's

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
he's been to the finals a lot and he's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.180 
he's been to the finals a lot and he's
won<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.830> lot<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.670> he<00:01:17.770> definitely<00:01:18.770> has<00:01:19.159> that

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
won a lot so he definitely has that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.790 
won a lot so he definitely has that
hanging<00:01:19.820> over<00:01:19.970> janki's<00:01:20.659> head<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.560> Jamie

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
hanging over janki's head because Jamie

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.180 
hanging over janki's head because Jamie
doesn't<00:01:22.070> have<00:01:22.250> anything<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:23.500> back<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.770> up<00:01:24.830> he

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
doesn't have anything to back this up he

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.100 
doesn't have anything to back this up he
hasn't<00:01:25.460> been<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.670> any<00:01:25.820> finals<00:01:26.300> he<00:01:26.690> hasn't<00:01:26.990> won

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
hasn't been to any finals he hasn't won

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.649 
hasn't been to any finals he hasn't won
any<00:01:27.350> major<00:01:27.830> championships<00:01:28.610> although<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.330> think

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
any major championships although I think

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.930 
any major championships although I think
he's<00:01:29.810> definitely<00:01:30.350> long<00:01:31.040> overdue<00:01:31.370> because<00:01:31.790> he

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
he's definitely long overdue because he

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.690 
he's definitely long overdue because he
had<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:32.570> excellent<00:01:33.200> winning<00:01:33.650> streak<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.130> this

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
had a excellent winning streak in this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.150 
had a excellent winning streak in this
ms<00:01:35.030> l<00:01:35.210> three<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:36.550> 10<00:01:39.580> here<00:01:40.580> we<00:01:40.760> go<00:01:41.890> this<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.010> on

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
ms l three to 10 here we go this is on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.370 
ms l three to 10 here we go this is on
Byzantium<00:01:43.640> too<00:01:43.850> looks<00:01:44.240> like<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:44.600> got<00:01:44.630> cross

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
Byzantium too looks like we got cross

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.600 
Byzantium too looks like we got cross
positions<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.430> any<00:01:46.790> kind<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:47.720> cheese<00:01:47.990> would<00:01:48.020> be

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
positions so any kind of cheese would be

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.880 
positions so any kind of cheese would be

cheese to this game I think that that
Jamey<00:02:20.900> definitely<00:02:21.200> should<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:22.270> predicting

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
Jamey definitely should be predicting

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.810 
Jamey definitely should be predicting
this<00:02:23.590> because<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:24.950> definitely<00:02:25.430> never

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
this because be so definitely never

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.320 
this because be so definitely never
afraid<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.300> cheese<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.790> he's<00:02:28.910> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
afraid to cheese like he's going to the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.460 
afraid to cheese like he's going to the
middle<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.750> he<00:02:29.810> might<00:02:29.960> be<00:02:30.110> thinking<00:02:30.140> about

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
middle so he might be thinking about

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.590 
middle so he might be thinking about
doing<00:02:30.980> Jane<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.520> strategy<00:02:32.030> against<00:02:32.450> him

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
doing Jane be strategy against him

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.940 
doing Jane be strategy against him
putting<00:02:32.840> down<00:02:34.360> gateways<00:02:35.360> or<00:02:35.630> something<00:02:36.110> he's

putting down gateways or something he's
actually<00:02:37.360> um<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> very<00:02:39.440> strange<00:02:39.920> place

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
actually um this is a very strange place

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.650 
actually um this is a very strange place
to<00:02:40.250> put<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.640> file<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.030> he's<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.270> putting<00:02:41.480> it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.360 
to put this file and he's not putting it
directly<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> middle<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.620> think<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.160> might

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
directly in the middle I think it might

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.210 
directly in the middle I think it might
be<00:02:43.400> spotted<00:02:43.970> by<00:02:44.200> j<00:02:45.200> &amp;<00:02:45.320> B<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.500> Jane<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.850> Scouts<00:02:46.850> up

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
a map pack and here's a looks like jamie

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.920 
a map pack and here's a looks like jamie
is<00:03:01.520> going<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.940> scout<00:03:02.270> though<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.810> is

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
is going out to scout though this is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.330 
is going out to scout though this is
going<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.140> be<00:03:03.200> very<00:03:03.230> important<00:03:03.860> which

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
going to be very important which

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.780 
going to be very important which
direction<00:03:04.850> he<00:03:05.000> Scouts<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:06.830> he<00:03:06.980> Scouts<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.550> he

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
direction he Scouts if he Scouts up he

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.300 
direction he Scouts if he Scouts up he
might<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.330> able<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.410> he<00:03:10.190> is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
might be able to see this and he is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.640 
might be able to see this and he is
scouting<00:03:10.549> up<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:11.690> think<00:03:12.200> he's<00:03:12.290> gonna<00:03:12.500> be

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

these<00:05:29.430> guys<00:05:29.639> I'm<00:05:30.000> just<00:05:30.180> gonna<00:05:30.570> be<00:05:30.750> able<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:31.020> oh

these guys I'm just gonna be able to oh
I<00:05:31.500> think<00:05:32.070> bc<00:05:32.250> definitely<00:05:32.669> has<00:05:32.759> the<00:05:32.789> advantage

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
I think bc definitely has the advantage

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.999 
I think bc definitely has the advantage
since<00:05:33.449> he<00:05:33.630> has<00:05:33.840> more<00:05:35.570> ocelots<00:05:36.570> here<00:05:37.009> this

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
since he has more ocelots here this

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.969 
since he has more ocelots here this
could<00:05:38.190> be<00:05:38.220> very<00:05:38.310> important<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.770> both<00:05:40.770> guys
