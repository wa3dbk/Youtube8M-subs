so<00:00:06.600> let's<00:00:06.839> start<00:00:07.170> by<00:00:07.410> giving<00:00:07.799> some<00:00:08.099> examples

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
so let's start by giving some examples

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.169 
so let's start by giving some examples
of<00:00:09.230> freezing<00:00:10.230> behavior<00:00:10.889> one<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> things

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
of freezing behavior one of the things

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.509 
of freezing behavior one of the things
that<00:00:12.389> you'll<00:00:12.540> notice<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.230> playing<00:00:13.590> poker<00:00:14.219> is

that you'll notice in playing poker is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.950 
that you'll notice in playing poker is
that<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.750> people<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:17.039> bluffing<00:00:17.960> often

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that when people are bluffing often

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.010 
that when people are bluffing often
times<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.680> will<00:00:19.859> restrain<00:00:20.520> themselves

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
times they will restrain themselves

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.240 
times they will restrain themselves
you'll<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.680> go<00:00:23.460> all-in<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.890> then<00:00:25.890> they

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you'll see them go all-in and then they

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
you'll see them go all-in and then they
sort<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> shut<00:00:26.939> down<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.510> hold<00:00:27.720> very<00:00:28.380> very

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sort of shut down they hold very very

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.380 
sort of shut down they hold very very
still<00:00:30.590> hardly<00:00:31.590> any<00:00:31.830> movement<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.790> visible

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
still hardly any movement is visible

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.030 
still hardly any movement is visible
compared<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.860> were<00:00:34.920> doing<00:00:35.340> before

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
compared to what they were doing before

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
compared to what they were doing before
chances<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.329> person<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.260> fact

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
chances are that this person is in fact

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160 
chances are that this person is in fact
bluffing<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.360> hold<00:00:42.570> their<00:00:42.840> breath

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bluffing they will hold their breath

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.220 
bluffing they will hold their breath
they<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.129> restrain<00:00:44.850> their<00:00:45.120> movements<00:00:45.809> we

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they will restrain their movements we

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.029 
they will restrain their movements we
see<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.950> Liars<00:00:47.309> also<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> way

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
see this with Liars also by the way

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
see this with Liars also by the way
Liars<00:00:50.039> tend<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.789> use<00:00:51.329> their<00:00:51.570> arms<00:00:51.960> less<00:00:52.469> they

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
Liars tend to use their arms less they

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.660 
Liars tend to use their arms less they
tend<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.640> less<00:00:54.110> expressive<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
tend to be less expressive so one of the

the table as to the behavior the
activity<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> other<00:01:34.170> players<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> crucial

activity of the other players is crucial

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.899 
activity of the other players is crucial
we<00:01:36.420> call<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.500> baseline<00:01:38.189> behaviors<00:01:39.320> and

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
we call this the baseline behaviors and

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
we call this the baseline behaviors and
one<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> advantages<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> sitting<00:01:43.680> there

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
one of the advantages of sitting there

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
one of the advantages of sitting there
at<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> table<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.149> collecting<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
at the table and collecting this

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.219 
at the table and collecting this
information<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.829> these<00:01:47.070> players<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.329> as

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
information on these players is that as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.490 
information on these players is that as
the<00:01:49.619> game<00:01:49.860> unfolds<00:01:50.540> all<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> sudden<00:01:52.259> you'll

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the game unfolds all of a sudden you'll

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.999 
the game unfolds all of a sudden you'll
notice<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.119> player<00:01:54.890> for<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
notice when this one player for the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
notice when this one player for the
first<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.640> moves<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.460> then<00:01:59.640> freezes

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
first time moves all in but then freezes

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039 
first time moves all in but then freezes
and<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:02.009> already<00:02:02.189> said<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
and we already said that one of the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.660 
and we already said that one of the
things<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.920> about<00:02:04.950> our<00:02:05.369> brain

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
things that we do know about our brain

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.960 
things that we do know about our brain
is<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.540> when<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:07.080> tend<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> freeze<00:02:08.099> it's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
is is that when we tend to freeze it's

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.530 
is is that when we tend to freeze it's
usually<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> result<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:11.130> threat<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
usually as a result of a threat and the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.250 
usually as a result of a threat and the
threat<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.220> person<00:02:14.489> may<00:02:14.970> be

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
threat here is that the person may be

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.970 
threat here is that the person may be
caught<00:02:16.260> bluffing<00:02:17.360> another<00:02:18.360> way<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.980> they

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
caught bluffing another way that they

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.940 
caught bluffing another way that they
may<00:02:20.130> freeze<00:02:20.520> at<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.030> table<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.950> normally

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
may freeze at the table is normally

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.460 
may freeze at the table is normally
they're<00:02:23.160> talkative<00:02:24.290> normally<00:02:25.290> they're

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
they're talkative normally they're

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.949 
they're talkative normally they're

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
yapping away talking about this and that

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.240 
yapping away talking about this and that
they<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.069> all<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.660> they're<00:02:30.660> bluffing<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:32.010> then

all of a sudden they're silent now
there's<00:02:36.150> something<00:02:36.660> inside<00:02:37.140> them<00:02:37.590> telling

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
there's something inside them telling

them to behave this way they don't mean
to<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.060> because<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.840> millions<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.470> years

this was one of the primal ways that we
