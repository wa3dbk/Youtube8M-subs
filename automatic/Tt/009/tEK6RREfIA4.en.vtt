grind down the stone you can see how the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.570 
grind down the stone you can see how the
stone<00:00:09.210> sticks<00:00:09.540> out<00:00:09.719> yeah<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.410> not<00:00:10.530> even<00:00:10.710> had

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
stone sticks out yeah it's not even had

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.980 
stone sticks out yeah it's not even had
to<00:00:11.639> grind<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> down<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> answer<00:00:12.840> will

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to grind that down so the answer will

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
to grind that down so the answer will
slightly<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> flush<00:00:14.219> okay<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
slightly and flush okay I see it

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.220 
slightly and flush okay I see it
electrical<00:00:15.450> outlet<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.750> back<00:00:15.929> corner

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
electrical outlet in the back corner

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
electrical outlet in the back corner
there<00:00:16.440> yeah<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.710> had<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:16.980> 110<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.460> there

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
there yeah we had to get 110 in there

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.189 
there yeah we had to get 110 in there
for<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> convection<00:00:18.480> fan<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.050> what's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
for the convection fan all right what's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
for the convection fan all right what's
this<00:00:19.289> pipe<00:00:19.529> doing<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.580> actually<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
this pipe doing you that's actually a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
this pipe doing you that's actually a
half<00:00:21.330> inch<00:00:21.539> gas<00:00:21.750> line<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.260> holes<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
half inch gas line with holes in it and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.599 
half inch gas line with holes in it and
to<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> log<00:00:24.150> lighter<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.720> log<00:00:25.260> lighter

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
to use as a log lighter a log lighter

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.009 
to use as a log lighter a log lighter
alright<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> shutoff<00:00:27.449> over<00:00:27.810> here

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
alright so is this the shutoff over here

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.470 
alright so is this the shutoff over here
yes<00:00:28.349> turn<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> lights<00:00:29.789> lugs<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
yes turn that on and it lights lugs that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.720 
yes turn that on and it lights lugs that
really<00:00:30.990> beats<00:00:31.199> Kinlan<00:00:31.619> yes<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
really beats Kinlan yes all right but

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.590 
really beats Kinlan yes all right but
that's<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> way<00:00:33.420> right

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that's got to get out of the way right

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.299 
that's got to get out of the way right
mm<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.290> got<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.440> cap<00:00:34.620> off<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.950> line<00:00:35.100> all<00:00:35.280> right

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
mm we got a cap off that line all right

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.270 
mm we got a cap off that line all right
good<00:00:35.640> yeah<00:00:36.440> using<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> couple<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> wrenches<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
good yeah using a couple of wrenches I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
good yeah using a couple of wrenches I
will<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> line<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:43.700> okay<00:00:45.350> all<00:00:46.350> right

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

will back that line out okay all right
and<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.399> cap<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.850> off<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and now we will cap that off with a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
and now we will cap that off with a
half-inch<00:00:48.719> cap<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> our<00:00:49.860> new<00:00:49.980> insert

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
half-inch cap now with our new insert

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.979 
half-inch cap now with our new insert
we're<00:00:50.579> no<00:00:50.760> longer<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> vent<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
we're no longer going to vent into this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
we're no longer going to vent into this
entire<00:00:52.379> chimney<00:00:52.890> mass<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> use

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
entire chimney mass we're going to use

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
entire chimney mass we're going to use
this<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> six<00:00:54.960> inch<00:00:55.230> stainless<00:00:55.770> steel

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
this it's a six inch stainless steel

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
this it's a six inch stainless steel
vent<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> run<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.390> 25<00:00:57.989> feet

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
vent this is going to run about 25 feet

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
vent this is going to run about 25 feet
up<00:00:58.469> through<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> top<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> our<00:00:59.250> chimney

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
up through the top of our chimney

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
up through the top of our chimney
now<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.449> any<00:01:00.539> fireplace<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> damper

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
now with any fireplace there is a damper

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
now with any fireplace there is a damper
you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you can see it right up and in now this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.719 
you can see it right up and in now this
damper<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> designed<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.369> able<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
damper is designed to be able to be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.370 
damper is designed to be able to be
opened<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.240> closed<00:01:06.540> when<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.810> fireplace<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
opened or closed when the fireplace is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.929 
opened or closed when the fireplace is
on<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> heat<00:01:08.369> doesn't<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.729> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
on or off so the heat doesn't go up

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.090 
on or off so the heat doesn't go up
through<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> chimney<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> our<00:01:10.920> way

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
through the chimney but it's in our way

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.370 
through the chimney but it's in our way
we<00:01:11.369> can't<00:01:11.580> run<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.450> vent<00:01:12.750> pipe<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.260> no

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
we can't run this vent pipe and it's no

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.679 
we can't run this vent pipe and it's no
longer<00:01:13.650> necessary<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.280> that's<00:01:14.430> got<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> go

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
longer necessary so that's got to go

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.630 
longer necessary so that's got to go
this<00:01:17.689> stamp<00:01:17.930> was<00:01:18.110> actually<00:01:18.530> welded<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.280> place

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
this stamp was actually welded in place

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.490 
this stamp was actually welded in place
when<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.090> fireplace<00:01:20.540> was<00:01:20.720> first<00:01:21.020> built<00:01:21.229> this

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
when the fireplace was first built this

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.350 
when the fireplace was first built this
is<00:01:21.650> really<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.920> best<00:01:22.130> way<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.580> get<00:01:23.000> rid<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.210> it

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
is really the best way to get rid of it

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.910 
is really the best way to get rid of it
so<00:01:23.720> even<00:01:23.900> with<00:01:24.080> our<00:01:24.200> damper<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.680> frame

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
so even with our damper and frame

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.830 
so even with our damper and frame
removed<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:25.520> still<00:01:25.850> don't<00:01:26.090> have<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.390> space<00:01:26.600> we

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
removed we still don't have the space we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.480 
removed we still don't have the space we
need<00:01:26.869> for<00:01:27.259> our<00:01:27.350> vent<00:01:27.530> pipes<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.009> these<00:01:28.130> bricks

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
need for our vent pipes so these bricks

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.969 
need for our vent pipes so these bricks
right<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:28.850> have<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.240> go<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:30.619> bricks<00:01:30.799> come

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
right here have to go the bricks come

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.529 
right here have to go the bricks come
out<00:01:31.070> with<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> chisel<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.270> sledgehammer

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
out with a chisel and a sledgehammer
