see<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.440> glitter<00:01:21.650> unless<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.040> get<00:01:22.130> like

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
see the glitter unless you get like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.740 
see the glitter unless you get like
right<00:01:22.550> under<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.850> light<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.330> you're<00:01:23.420> looking

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
right under a light and you're looking

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.660 
right under a light and you're looking
right<00:01:23.930> at<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:25.010> kind<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.220> pointless<00:01:25.460> to

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
right at it so it's kind of pointless to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.180 
right at it so it's kind of pointless to
even<00:01:25.730> have<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.090> glitter<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:26.450> here<00:01:26.690> but<00:01:27.190> it's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
even have the glitter in here but it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.380 
even have the glitter in here but it's
still<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.400> pretty<00:01:28.610> color<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.090> light<00:01:29.240> lavender

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
still a pretty color the light lavender

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.780 
still a pretty color the light lavender
color<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.930> still<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.320> pretty<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.520> is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
color is still really pretty so that is

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.450

my<00:02:56.690> nails<00:02:56.810> were<00:02:57.020> longer<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.560> last<00:02:57.770> video

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
my nails were longer in the last video

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.070 
is helping when my nails are longer they
flex<00:03:07.370> more<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.060> get<00:03:08.330> those<00:03:08.510> cracks
