00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.990
 this time gamemakers beijing sitia we need near camping 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.630
 the clinch agreed 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.300
 the apartheid black olives 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.689
 garlic 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.390
 way too skinny 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.939
 guest parmesan pepper and we start chopping the garlic 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.939
 a press conference 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 because money is 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.220
 cut back and melt in as much as possible in the same season 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.610
 olive oil 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.970
 this is the sale 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.340
 they suffer when not then we are going to halve the rankings it is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 distances are of course the most useful 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.590
 7 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.750
 the cards are water sports achieved 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.320
 the savior funk is not too high 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 because then it should not burn that is not good for taste one 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.670
 little olive oil in the bank and then do it almost immediately yourself in the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.590
 baking pan 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.650
 before it gets too hot 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.930
 the pandas own of course already sent 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.240
 we are going to cook quickly with a passer-by 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.880
 it is finished in a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 pay attention 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 that the water come on the ice 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.509
 if at first I don't just melt it either 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.210
 And that gives nice ash wood 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 taste to the states 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.740
 to provoke the fall 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.830
 I have myself too 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.370
 even the garlic must not burn 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 So it is now important that you get the capers as quickly as possible 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.110
 and stay there 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.340
 throws in the property 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 unfortunately a minute or two 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 the peeled tomatoes 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.150
 schuitema to measure in pieces it does not have to be very fine 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.570
 and to simmer this for another ten minutes later 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.420
 wait on Saturday 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 she is holding in the water 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.270
 He thinks the trip comes from the perspective of pasta packs of wood 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.119
 brain around a bit 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.889
 and now it looks like a new building from van gogh is a very nice building 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.799
 scattered in the tire 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.759
 it's the works ready so it's public 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.339
 Utrecht almost ready 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 he frustrates the iphone 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.059
 He's ready 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:28.839
 the basil in the room 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.699
 that may not sound perfect but it will keep it nice and sweet especially 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.790
 pepper salt and better watch out because if elvis is recovered 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.609
 conversation has gone 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.609
 everything is mixed up 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.299
 the parmesan cheese 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.299
 and then you get to the premier league within twenty minutes 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.279
 I am not talking about that
