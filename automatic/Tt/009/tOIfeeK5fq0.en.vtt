00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.210

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:13.990
 about everyone everyone sees me 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.800
 everyone listens to me well 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.440
 Excellent 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.230
 given the painful events that have 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.210
 happened professor dumbledore has 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.540
 allowed to create this small club of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.810
 duel and prepare them well in case 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.210
 they need to defend themselves as I 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.980
 I 've done it countless times for more 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.980
 details see my books 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.769
 I present my assistant the professor 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.769
 snape 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.880
 I agree to help me with this demonstration 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.820
 I do not want none distress his 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.180
 dear professor will not be hurt not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180
 teman 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 one 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 2. 3 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.420
 I think that I do not think it's an excellent idea 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.390
 show that professor snape but let me 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.009
 tell him it was too obvious what 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.590
 I pretended to do if I had wanted 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.020
 avoiding it would have been simple 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.520
 It may be prudent to first teach 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.979
 the students to block 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.979

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.920

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.920
