you're gonna go gank those lanes you
need<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.230> plan<00:02:47.530> out<00:02:47.709> every<00:02:48.190> single<00:02:48.400> step<00:02:48.760> of

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
need to plan out every single step of

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.699 
need to plan out every single step of
that<00:02:49.030> gank<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.140> biggest<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.680> most

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
that gank that is the biggest and most

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.080 
that gank that is the biggest and most
important<00:02:51.280> tip<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.700> give<00:02:52.000> you

important tip that I can give you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.059 
important tip that I can give you
because<00:02:52.390> basically<00:02:52.959> as<00:02:53.440> you're<00:02:53.650> gonna<00:02:53.769> see

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
because basically as you're gonna see

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.430 
because basically as you're gonna see
with<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> way<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.819> build<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.930> actually<00:02:56.110> put

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
with a way I build I don't actually put

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.690 
with a way I build I don't actually put
a<00:02:56.500> lot<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.799> points<00:02:56.950> towards<00:02:57.340> my<00:02:57.430> chompers

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
a lot of points towards my chompers

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.120 
a lot of points towards my chompers
because<00:02:58.180> literally<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:58.989> I'm<00:02:59.110> ganking<00:02:59.739> those

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
because literally when I'm ganking those

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.039 
because literally when I'm ganking those
choppers<00:03:00.730> are<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> only<00:03:01.450> thing<00:03:01.690> that's<00:03:01.900> gonna

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
choppers are the only thing that's gonna

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.350 
choppers are the only thing that's gonna
make<00:03:02.290> my<00:03:02.440> game<00:03:02.610> compensate<00:03:03.610> for<00:03:03.790> my<00:03:03.849> loss<00:03:03.940> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
make my game compensate for my loss of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.270 
make my game compensate for my loss of
speed<00:03:04.629> so<00:03:05.110> what<00:03:05.319> I'm<00:03:05.440> gonna<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.829> is<00:03:05.980> I'm<00:03:06.160> gonna

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
speed so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.340 
speed so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
keep<00:03:06.640> let's<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.120> use<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> top<00:03:07.660> line<00:03:07.870> example

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
keep let's just use a top line example

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.770 
keep let's just use a top line example
I'm<00:03:08.769> gonna<00:03:09.040> keep<00:03:09.280> him<00:03:09.549> kind<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.209> pushing<00:03:10.660> on

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
I'm gonna keep him kind of pushing on

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.379 
I'm gonna keep him kind of pushing on
our<00:03:10.959> tower<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.650> enemy<00:03:11.980> being<00:03:12.160> him<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.760> when

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
our tower the enemy being him and when

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.420 
our tower the enemy being him and when
he<00:03:13.420> gets<00:03:13.750> past<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:14.739> know<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.859> halfway<00:03:15.190> point

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
he gets past you know the halfway point

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.400 
he gets past you know the halfway point
I'm<00:03:16.150> gonna<00:03:16.450> run<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:16.959> he's<00:03:17.079> gonna<00:03:17.170> start

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
I'm gonna run it and he's gonna start

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.229 
I'm gonna run it and he's gonna start
walking<00:03:17.620> backwards<00:03:18.190> my<00:03:18.340> choppers<00:03:18.880> are<00:03:19.060> going

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
walking backwards my choppers are going

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.970 
walking backwards my choppers are going
to<00:03:19.329> block<00:03:19.569> him<00:03:19.750> up<00:03:19.870> cuz<00:03:20.019> most<00:03:20.230> likely<00:03:20.620> he's<00:03:20.799> not

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
to block him up cuz most likely he's not

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
to block him up cuz most likely he's not
gonna<00:03:21.130> flash<00:03:21.459> over<00:03:21.880> my<00:03:22.060> chompers

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
gonna flash over my chompers

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.900 
gonna flash over my chompers
from<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.350> moment<00:03:23.380> whoever<00:03:24.250> my<00:03:24.430> top<00:03:24.670> lane<00:03:24.880> is

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
from that moment whoever my top lane is

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.490 
from that moment whoever my top lane is
he<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.420> also<00:03:25.600> come<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.109> at<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.350> moment

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
he can also come in at that moment

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.050 
he can also come in at that moment
because<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.920> choppers<00:03:27.280> will<00:03:27.400> last<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:27.819> long

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
because the choppers will last a long

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.940 
because the choppers will last a long
time<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.750> has<00:03:28.930> nothing<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.440> helpful<00:03:29.680> and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
time that has nothing but helpful and

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.890 
time that has nothing but helpful and
then<00:03:30.370> while<00:03:30.639> he's<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.180> chopper<00:03:31.569> stun<00:03:31.780> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
then while he's in that chopper stun you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.750 
then while he's in that chopper stun you
also<00:03:32.139> hit<00:03:32.440> him<00:03:32.560> with<00:03:32.680> zap<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.220> he<00:03:33.430> slowed<00:03:33.730> down

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
also hit him with zap and he slowed down

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.670 
also hit him with zap and he slowed down
and<00:03:34.239> then<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.930> start<00:03:35.049> firing<00:03:35.319> at<00:03:35.650> him

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
and then you just start firing at him

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.839 
and then you just start firing at him
with<00:03:35.950> your<00:03:36.069> machine<00:03:36.160> gun<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.670> then<00:03:36.790> you

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
with your machine gun and then you

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.520 
with your machine gun and then you
finish<00:03:37.060> off<00:03:37.299> with<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.599> rocket<00:03:38.019> blast<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.410> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
finish off with a rocket blast if you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.650 
finish off with a rocket blast if you
need<00:03:38.680> alt<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.579> will<00:03:39.730> help<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:40.359> it's<00:03:40.480> not

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
need alt that will help you but it's not

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.479 
need alt that will help you but it's not
really<00:03:40.959> necessary<00:03:41.530> now<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.040> great<00:03:42.310> thing

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
really necessary now the great thing

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.490 
really necessary now the great thing
about<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:43.000> as<00:03:43.120> well<00:03:43.299> as<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.780> after<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
about that as well as is that after you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.770 
about that as well as is that after you
kill<00:03:44.739> them<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:45.130> pass<00:03:45.340> or<00:03:45.609> Prague's<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:46.389> this

kill them the pass or Prague's now this

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.720 
kill them the pass or Prague's now this
is<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> very<00:03:47.260> rare<00:03:47.500> instance<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.250> if<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.519> pipe
