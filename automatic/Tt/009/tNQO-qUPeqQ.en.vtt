important<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> understand<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
important to understand is that it's

some parts of Afghanistan than and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
others but overall it is a huge PR

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
others but overall it is a huge PR
disaster<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> u.s.<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.449> we're<00:00:57.870> looking

disaster for the u.s. so we're looking

then at a backlash against American

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.660 
then at a backlash against American
troops<00:01:00.480> perhaps<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> ground<00:01:02.129> rather

these these peace talks which are about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.789 
these these peace talks which are about
to<00:01:07.650> start<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.430> soon<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.560> that's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to start we think soon that that's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
to start we think soon that that's
that's<00:01:11.070> accurate<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> great<00:01:11.970> degree<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's accurate to a great degree but to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
that's accurate to a great degree but to
expect<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:13.979> images<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
expect that because of these images that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
expect that because of these images that
have<00:01:14.850> been<00:01:15.000> broadcast<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.780> presumably<00:01:16.049> on

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
have been broadcast but presumably on

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
have been broadcast but presumably on
the<00:01:16.409> Afghan<00:01:16.799> media<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.049> have

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the Afghan media so that by now so have

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.440 
the Afghan media so that by now so have
large-scale<00:01:20.070> demonstrations<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:21.000> Afghans

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
large-scale demonstrations by Afghans

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
large-scale demonstrations by Afghans
and<00:01:21.630> others<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> ground<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.680> Afghanistan

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and others on the ground in Afghanistan

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
and others on the ground in Afghanistan
involving<00:01:23.729> burning<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> American<00:01:24.509> flags<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
involving burning of American flags I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.719 
involving burning of American flags I
think<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:25.770> far-fetched<00:01:26.009> but

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
think is a little too far-fetched but

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
think is a little too far-fetched but
what<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.720> does<00:01:28.110> create<00:01:28.530> more

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
what it does is it does create more

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.120 
what it does is it does create more
negativity<00:01:29.460> among<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> Afghans<00:01:30.829> about<00:01:31.829> the

10 years of war I think there now you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.289 
10 years of war I think there now you
have<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> strongest<00:01:49.770> push<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.820> parties

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
have the strongest push from all parties

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.719 
have the strongest push from all parties
involved<00:01:51.750> especially<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.320> US<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> Taliban

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
involved especially the US the Taliban

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.550 
involved especially the US the Taliban
themselves<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> Afghan<00:01:55.020> government<00:01:55.049> as

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
themselves and the Afghan government as

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.870 
themselves and the Afghan government as
well<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> withdrawal<00:01:56.399> deadline<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
well because the withdrawal deadline is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
well because the withdrawal deadline is
coming<00:01:57.149> close<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> push<00:01:58.619> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
coming close but but the push is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
coming close but but the push is
stronger<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.430> ever<00:01:59.610> towards<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> negotiated

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
stronger than ever towards a negotiated

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.600 
stronger than ever towards a negotiated
settlement<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.380> Afghan<00:02:01.740> peace<00:02:01.920> or<00:02:02.430> for

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
settlement for the Afghan peace or for

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.359 
settlement for the Afghan peace or for
peace<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> Afghan<00:02:03.469> conflict<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.250> add

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
peace in the Afghan conflict but to add

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
peace in the Afghan conflict but to add
one<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:06.060> point<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> video

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
one other point about that the video

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
one other point about that the video
involving<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.340> alleged<00:02:08.729> dealer<00:02:09.030> nation<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
involving the alleged dealer nation of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.720 
involving the alleged dealer nation of
US<00:02:09.720> Marine<00:02:10.020> Corps<00:02:10.050> troops<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.890> Afghanistan<00:02:11.520> I

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
US Marine Corps troops in Afghanistan I

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.570 
US Marine Corps troops in Afghanistan I
think<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.629> sort<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.110> cognate

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
think there is sort of a cognate

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.970 
think there is sort of a cognate
dissonance<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.300> Washington<00:02:15.020> about<00:02:15.200> what<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
dissonance in Washington about what the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.490 
dissonance in Washington about what the
US<00:02:16.160> wants<00:02:16.670> its<00:02:16.910> troops<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.300> do<00:02:17.450> or<00:02:17.720> thinks<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
US wants its troops to do or thinks of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.200 
US wants its troops to do or thinks of
its<00:02:18.710> troops<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.100> what<00:02:19.430> these<00:02:19.610> individuals

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
its troops and what these individuals

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.780 
its troops and what these individuals
have<00:02:20.360> allegedly<00:02:20.750> done<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.770> think<00:02:21.830> but<00:02:22.460> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
have allegedly done and I think but and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.210 
have allegedly done and I think but and
many<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.360> West<00:02:23.660> I've<00:02:23.990> also<00:02:24.320> are<00:02:24.500> similarly

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
many in the West I've also are similarly

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.470 
many in the West I've also are similarly
shocked<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:25.790> what's<00:02:25.970> important<00:02:26.420> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
shocked but what's important to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.510 
shocked but what's important to
understand<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:28.040> shock<00:02:28.310> in

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
understand is that the shock in

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.760 
understand is that the shock in
Afghanistan<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.360> not<00:02:29.510> per<00:02:29.870> se<00:02:30.110> about<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> act

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
Afghanistan is not per se about the act

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.550 
Afghanistan is not per se about the act
but<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.400> involves<00:02:31.820> an<00:02:32.120> action<00:02:32.630> urination<00:02:33.440> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
but it involves an action urination and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.990 
but it involves an action urination and
desecration<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.250> corpses<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.760> are

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
desecration of corpses that are

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
desecration of corpses that are
culturally<00:02:35.510> more<00:02:35.750> significant<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.830> Afghans

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
culturally more significant to Afghans

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.310 
culturally more significant to Afghans
than<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.820> act<00:02:38.000> per<00:02:38.300> se<00:02:38.510> itself<00:02:38.930> as<00:02:39.140> is

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
than the act per se itself as is

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.530 
than the act per se itself as is
understood<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.040> West<00:02:40.070> again<00:02:40.880> much<00:02:41.180> Yuja

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
understood in the West again much Yuja

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.170 
understood in the West again much Yuja
thank<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:41.900> much<00:02:42.020> indeed
