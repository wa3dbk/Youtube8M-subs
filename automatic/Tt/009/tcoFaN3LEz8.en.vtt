00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
as good as the other openings in my

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.609 
as good as the other openings in my
opinion<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.780> first<00:01:45.990> opening<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> my

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
opinion like the first opening in my

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.749 
opinion like the first opening in my
opinion<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> always<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> best<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
opinion is always the best you

apparently like the second one I i

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
apparently like the second one I i
personally<00:01:50.250> prefer<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> second<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
personally prefer the second one to the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.300 
personally prefer the second one to the
first<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.509> yes<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:52.950> cuz<00:01:53.220> i

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
first one yes but what about now cuz i

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
don't really like it as much competitive

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.249 
don't really like it as much competitive
though<00:01:55.850> yeah<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> weakest<00:01:57.780> opening

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
though yeah this is the weakest opening

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.560 
though yeah this is the weakest opening
in<00:01:58.799> terms<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> some<00:01:59.520> wires<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.030> terms<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> like

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in terms of some wires in terms of like

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.350 
in terms of some wires in terms of like
a<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> pages<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.549> actual<00:02:03.000> opening

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
a kind of pages of the actual opening

a kind of pages of the actual opening
like<00:02:03.960> visuals<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.530> well<00:02:04.680> I'd<00:02:04.829> say<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
like visuals as well I'd say it's the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.270 
like visuals as well I'd say it's the
weakest<00:02:05.700> yeah<00:02:06.210> exactly<00:02:06.320> siren<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.380> after<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
weakest yeah exactly siren is after the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.150 
weakest yeah exactly siren is after the
