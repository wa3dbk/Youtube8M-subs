00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.440
 good afternoon everyone i'm now i'm a little 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.810
 I'll tell you, but who has the difficulty of a chair? 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.810
 more precisely about how to modernize it and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.119
 for more comfortable fishing this type 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 many companies produce these chairs 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.160
 chairs have a number of significant 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 advantages 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.700
 firstly it is an affordable price also when 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 its small weight is a cross on in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.219
 clothes are quite large loads and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.079
 for example, the characteristics of this model 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.789
 specified maximum load weight 150 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 kilogram is also of course very easy 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.129
 it takes literally two movements and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.289
 sanji and easy to fold 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.480
 still in this chair there are additional 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 devices 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 here we have such a folding table 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.570
 and on the other hand there are such 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.140
 pockets for different fishing come on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.360
 10 three small and 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.760
 bottom one big branch now i'm 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.119
 show you how to upgrade it and 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.950
 tell you why we do it and so 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.530
 our upgrade will consist of two 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.630
 stages the first stage will be to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.780
 tom to eliminate one significant 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.750
 a disadvantage that will allow us substantially 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220
 extend the life of this chair and 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.060
 by the way this flaw has all the chairs 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.430
 this type 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.290
 and the second stage in the modernization will be 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.050
 be to increase comfort 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.660
 while fishing 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.460
 the main disadvantage of this chair is 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.190
 that the frame here is made of thin-walled 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.710
 aluminum pipe and these guides 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.619
 made of steel and it turns out that 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.910
 Aluminum operating time is very fast 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.759
 frayed on steel 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.830
 in the end , this fish burst their place 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.270
 worn out 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.479
 in fact this problem is solved 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.340
 very easy for that we need 4 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.100
 metal plastics plumbing 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.410
 pipes the length of these pipes should be such 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.470
 so that they begin here 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.019
 side frame and reached the point where 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.340
 here is this frame 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.640
 in contact with this metal 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.239
 directing then we are in each of these 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.250
 four pipe segments are doing here 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.540
 longitudinal cuts this can be done 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.190
 usual creepy on metal and then 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.190
 so here is a little chair fold 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 and now this longitudinal section of dress 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:48.159
 on a metal guide here or 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.760
 we do the same with each of these 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.349
 we have four guides and so here I am 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.829
 put on all four metal-plastic 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.560
 pipes 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:01.030
 After all, in front of 2 behind now we are laying out 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.549
 chair and see that the aluminum frame and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.099
 completely rests on the plastic pipe 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.159
 this one hundred percent will protect the frame of the chair 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.959
 under the chafing about becoming the second stage 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.269
 modernization will be interesting to fans 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.939
 feeder fishing the thing is that such 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.760
 cresta their processes are high enough 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.579
 feeder fishing is very tiring all 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.859
 time nomination for bait so 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.379
 I will now show how capacity for 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.269
 bait adapt such a chair in 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.189
 as capacity for bait we will 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.879
 use this 5 liter bucket 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.530
 with under paints and we will fix on 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.709
 side frame 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.629
 first we need to put a bucket 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.060
 or so that while fishing 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.400
 she did not interfere with us that is what the price does not 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.009
 rested but at the same time so that liters 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.169
 was at hand 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:52.750
 then we need to do two 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.979
 through holes through the thigh and frame 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.280
 a chair that is one tower one below and 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:02.769
 after which we need two bolts with 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.330
 T-shirts in diameter are the same as 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:12.130
 holes and these bolts 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:22.420
 we will fasten the bucket is like this 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:23.490
 here we insert one god bucket insert in 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.270
 hole 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.819
 tula 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.819
 on the back we tighten the nut 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.090
 and do the same with the bottom bolt 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.419
 with u peter securely fixed now 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.050
 pour in here mixed in advance 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.050
 prikormku 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.789
 and you can start fishing as you can see 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.310
 But I sat down and I always have it at hand 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.560
 will be prikormku here you saw how 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.960
 you can simply organize inexpensively 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.330
 good fishing place all the tail
