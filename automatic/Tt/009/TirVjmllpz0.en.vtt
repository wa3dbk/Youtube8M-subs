then it is less than active of services
instantly<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.250> means<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.790> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
instantly this means that the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.610 
instantly this means that the
competitive<00:00:55.390> products<00:00:55.750> require<00:00:56.140> complex

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
competitive products require complex

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.889 
competitive products require complex
dosing<00:00:57.130> systems<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:58.210> give<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.450> chemicals

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
dosing systems to give the chemicals

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
dosing systems to give the chemicals
enough<00:00:59.140> time<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.590> react

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
enough time to react

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.070 
enough time to react
so<00:01:01.059> activox<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.809> much<00:01:02.140> simpler<00:01:04.080> activox

so<00:02:03.060> activox<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.720> much<00:02:04.050> safer<00:02:05.390> okay<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.450> that's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so activox is much safer okay so that's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.620 
so activox is much safer okay so that's

note<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.800> chlorine<00:02:23.220> dioxide<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.850> produced

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
note is the chlorine dioxide is produced

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.979 
note is the chlorine dioxide is produced
directly<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.020> solution<00:02:25.620> ready<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.459> use<00:02:26.750> no<00:02:27.750> gas

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
directly in solution ready to use no gas

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.960 
directly in solution ready to use no gas
is<00:02:28.200> released<00:02:28.380> which<00:02:28.980> means<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> activox

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
is released which means that the activox

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.000 
is released which means that the activox
dosing<00:02:30.420> system<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:31.080> much<00:02:31.350> simpler<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
dosing system can be much simpler and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.940 
dosing system can be much simpler and
safer<00:02:32.550> than<00:02:33.239> other<00:02:33.450> chlorine<00:02:33.690> dioxide

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
safer than other chlorine dioxide

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.300 
safer than other chlorine dioxide
generators<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.989> show<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:37.620> simple<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
generators to show just how simple and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.090 
generators to show just how simple and
safe<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.820> activox<00:02:39.269> reaction<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.769> this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
safe the activox reaction is in this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.070 
safe the activox reaction is in this
demonstration<00:02:41.459> we've<00:02:42.180> substituted<00:02:42.570> the
