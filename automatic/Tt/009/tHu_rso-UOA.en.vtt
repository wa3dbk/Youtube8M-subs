00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.080 
won't go this solid it's just a really
really<00:01:16.500> fantastically<00:01:17.360> well-built<00:01:18.360> item<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
really fantastically well-built item and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
really fantastically well-built item and
it's<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> pretty<00:01:21.600> simple<00:01:21.810> build<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> why

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it's a pretty simple build which is why

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's a pretty simple build which is why
they've<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.520> able<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.350> robust

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
they've been able to make it so robust

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
they've been able to make it so robust
and<00:01:26.490> by<00:01:26.729> simple<00:01:27.119> build<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.540> mean<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.259> doesn't

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and by simple build I mean it doesn't

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
and by simple build I mean it doesn't
have<00:01:28.530> anything<00:01:29.310> fancy<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
have anything fancy on it you know it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.090 
have anything fancy on it you know it
doesn't<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> extending<00:01:31.590> legs<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.950> anything

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
doesn't have extending legs or anything

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
doesn't have extending legs or anything
like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> comes<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
like that but again it comes back to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.050 
like that but again it comes back to
that<00:01:34.079> point<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.530> doing<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.369> job<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that point of doing that one job really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
that point of doing that one job really
really<00:01:36.360> well<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.950> let<00:01:37.950> me<00:01:38.009> show<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
really well so let me show this in

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
really well so let me show this in
comparison<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.909> some<00:01:39.060> other<00:01:39.119> ones<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:40.170> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
comparison to some other ones this is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.950 
comparison to some other ones this is
the<00:01:40.590> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.100> standard<00:01:41.670> average<00:01:41.960> tripod

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the sort of your standard average tripod
