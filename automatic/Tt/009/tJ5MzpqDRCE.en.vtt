hi<00:00:01.829> everyone<00:00:02.129> its<00:00:02.520> Danny<00:00:03.020> since<00:00:04.020> I'm

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hi everyone its Danny since I'm

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.710 
hi everyone its Danny since I'm
reporting<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.740> Mill<00:00:05.279> Tony<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.089> really

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
reporting this Mill Tony do I really

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.930 
reporting this Mill Tony do I really
want<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> divide<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.319> because<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.340> very

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
want to divide it because it is very

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.020 
want to divide it because it is very
overgrown<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.380> think<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.650> could<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:11.099> by

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
overgrown and I think you could do by

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.390 
overgrown and I think you could do by
being<00:00:12.240> divided<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.530> I'm<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.219> show

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
being divided so I'm just going to show

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.760 
being divided so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:14.429> how<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.849> properly<00:00:15.360> divide<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> non-si<00:00:16.560> diem

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
you how to properly divide a non-si diem

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.470 
you how to properly divide a non-si diem
or<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.160> ounce<00:00:17.279> idiom<00:00:17.640> into<00:00:17.880> generic<00:00:18.150> because

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
or an ounce idiom into generic because

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.230 
or an ounce idiom into generic because
they<00:00:18.869> do<00:00:18.930> share<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> same<00:00:19.560> traits<00:00:20.180> now<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
they do share the same traits now the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.050 
they do share the same traits now the
golden<00:00:21.689> rule<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.650> leave<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.070> least<00:00:23.460> three

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
golden rule is to leave at least three

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.689 
golden rule is to leave at least three
pseudobulbs<00:00:24.750> per<00:00:25.260> division<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:26.519> you're

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
pseudobulbs per division and when you're

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
pseudobulbs per division and when you're
dealing<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.150> big<00:00:27.689> oncidium<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
dealing with big oncidium they can this

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.740 
dealing with big oncidium they can this
can<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:29.849> easy<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.480> they

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
can be actually very easy because they

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
can be actually very easy because they
have<00:00:30.929> large<00:00:31.199> bulbs<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> are

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
have large bulbs but when you are

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.660 
have large bulbs but when you are
dealing<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.480> multi<00:00:34.140> mediums<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.219> have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
dealing with multi mediums that have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.440 
dealing with multi mediums that have
very<00:00:36.090> tiny<00:00:36.590> pseudobulbs<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:38.640> might<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> bit

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
very tiny pseudobulbs it might be a bit

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.799 
very tiny pseudobulbs it might be a bit
confusing<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.160> I'll<00:00:41.489> try<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> divide

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
confusing at first so I'll try to divide

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.310 
confusing at first so I'll try to divide
this<00:00:43.050> or<00:00:43.410> kit<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.770> best<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.320> show

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
this or kit as best as I can and show

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.160 
this or kit as best as I can and show
you<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
you how I like to do it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
you how I like to do it
okay<00:00:50.000> now<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.449> rule<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> three

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
okay now the rule with the three

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.479 
okay now the rule with the three
pseudobulbs<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.250> should<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.059> applied<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
pseudobulbs here should be applied but I

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
pseudobulbs here should be applied but I
think<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.789> divide<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.270> orchid<00:00:57.750> with

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
think I will divide this orchid with

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.950 
think I will divide this orchid with
more<00:00:59.010> suitable<00:00:59.399> spur<00:00:59.760> division<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
more suitable spur division because it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.560 
more suitable spur division because it
is<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.410> such<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> small<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.340> CDM<00:01:02.730> compared<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is just such a small and CDM compared to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.310 
is just such a small and CDM compared to
others<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.860> first<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.150> try<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.750> check<00:01:07.110> if

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
others so first of all try to check if

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
others so first of all try to check if
any<00:01:07.680> part<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> plant<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.000> coming<00:01:09.360> loose<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
any part of the plant is coming loose on

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.340 
any part of the plant is coming loose on
its<00:01:10.110> own<00:01:11.090> sometimes<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> luck

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
its own sometimes you can have the luck

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
its own sometimes you can have the luck
that<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> plant<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.670> comes<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.509> its

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that the plant actually comes up on its

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.160 
that the plant actually comes up on its
own<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
own as we can see here this one kind of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.490 
own as we can see here this one kind of
comes<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.259> can

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
comes off but if you look at it we can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.060 
comes off but if you look at it we can
see<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.220> rather<00:01:23.810> tiny<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> division

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
see that it's rather tiny for a division

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.789 
see that it's rather tiny for a division
and<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> rather<00:01:27.330> tiny<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.140> taste<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.680> do

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
and it is rather tiny for my taste I do

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.920 
and it is rather tiny for my taste I do
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> divide<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> circuit<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.299> two<00:01:30.659> or

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
want to divide the circuit in two or

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.429 
want to divide the circuit in two or
three<00:01:31.280> divisions<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.180> let's<00:01:33.390> try<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.689> find<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
three divisions so let's try to find a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.190 
three divisions so let's try to find a
spot<00:01:35.189> where<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.820> divide<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> could

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
spot where we can divide so if I could

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
spot where we can divide so if I could
split<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.310> would<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.520> fantastic

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
split this here it would be fantastic

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.539 
split this here it would be fantastic
and<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> doesn't<00:01:43.770> come<00:01:44.040> loose<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.490> can

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and if it doesn't come loose you can

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.139 
and if it doesn't come loose you can
always<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> small<00:01:45.509> knife<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.850> rather<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
always use a small knife or rather a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.929 
always use a small knife or rather a
sharp<00:01:48.420> knife<00:01:48.770> but<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:50.100> try<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
sharp knife but I will try to see if I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.020 
sharp knife but I will try to see if I
can<00:01:51.119> divide<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.689> without<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> knife<00:01:53.030> first

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
can divide this without the knife first

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
can divide this without the knife first
I<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.299> want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.649> pseudobulbs<00:01:56.399> are

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I just want to see which pseudobulbs are

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.429 
I just want to see which pseudobulbs are
linked<00:01:56.939> together<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.259> bulb

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
linked together so this little bulb

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.210 
linked together so this little bulb
seems<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.280> come<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.240> one

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.370 

so<00:02:06.760> let's<00:02:06.940> see<00:02:07.120> if<00:02:07.180> we<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:08.970> jam<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.000> loose<00:02:13.380> some

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
so let's see if we can jam it loose some

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.270 
so let's see if we can jam it loose some
roots<00:02:14.620> will<00:02:14.920> be<00:02:15.540> damaged<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.380> process<00:02:17.560> but

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
roots will be damaged in the process but

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.210 
roots will be damaged in the process but
you<00:02:18.430> shouldn't<00:02:18.700> worry<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.210> will<00:02:19.980> grow<00:02:20.980> back

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
you shouldn't worry it will grow back

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.490 
you shouldn't worry it will grow back
just<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.700> sure<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.060> leave<00:02:22.270> some<00:02:22.600> notes<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
just be sure you leave some notes on the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:35.600 
just be sure you leave some notes on the
divisions<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:30.070> came<00:02:30.340> off

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 

the<00:02:36.150> roots<00:02:36.360> are<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> bit<00:02:36.720> tangled<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.470> just

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the roots are a bit tangled you just

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.290 
the roots are a bit tangled you just
need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.460> have<00:02:38.610> patience<00:02:43.700> I'm<00:02:44.700> almost<00:02:45.060> done

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
need to have patience I'm almost done

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.060 
need to have patience I'm almost done
here<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.220> go<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:51.380> we<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> prop<00:02:52.920> in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
here there you go here we have a prop in

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.800 
here there you go here we have a prop in
the<00:02:53.190> proper<00:02:53.700> division<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.450> melting

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the proper division of this melting

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.100 
the proper division of this melting
medium<00:02:55.790> they<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.970> some<00:02:57.210> old<00:02:57.390> bulbs<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
medium they have some old bulbs to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.060 
medium they have some old bulbs to
ensure<00:02:58.770> some<00:02:59.390> water<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.720> nutrients<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.890> have

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
ensure some water and nutrients we have

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.580 
ensure some water and nutrients we have
some<00:03:02.250> roots

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
some roots

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.800 
some roots
well<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.790> multi<00:03:06.120> medium<00:03:06.450> was<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> bit

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
well this multi medium was a bit

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
well this multi medium was a bit
suffering<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.550> them<00:03:08.700> are<00:03:08.850> alive

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
suffering so not all of them are alive

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.290 
suffering so not all of them are alive
but<00:03:09.720> some<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> them<00:03:10.410> are<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.910> new<00:03:12.000> suitor

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
but some of them are and the new suitor

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.340 
but some of them are and the new suitor
bulbs<00:03:12.660> will<00:03:13.290> produce<00:03:13.530> new<00:03:14.190> roots<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.200> is

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
bulbs will produce new roots so this is

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
bulbs will produce new roots so this is
a<00:03:16.380> good<00:03:16.590> enough<00:03:16.830> division<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:20.360> really<00:03:21.360> don't

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
a good enough division I really don't

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.340 
a good enough division I really don't
want<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.550> divide<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.970> part<00:03:24.300> here<00:03:24.660> because

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
want to divide this part here because

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.310 
want to divide this part here because
it's<00:03:25.709> too<00:03:25.950> tiny<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.670> my<00:03:27.240> taste<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.050> if<00:03:28.200> I

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
it's too tiny for my taste and if I

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.440 
it's too tiny for my taste and if I
leave<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.560> here<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.170> grow<00:03:31.170> better<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
leave it here it will grow better I

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.360 
leave it here it will grow better I
really<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.630> want<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> remove<00:03:34.290> these<00:03:34.890> dead

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
really just want to remove these dead

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.340 
really just want to remove these dead
suitor<00:03:35.820> bulbs<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.270> usually<00:03:36.750> they<00:03:36.900> come<00:03:37.170> off

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
suitor bulbs and usually they come off

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.180 
suitor bulbs and usually they come off
like<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:40.519> see<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.820> can<00:03:42.140> make<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.440> look<00:03:43.739> a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
like so see if I can make this look a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.880 
like so see if I can make this look a
bit<00:03:44.880> more<00:03:45.030> pretty

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.950 

I<00:03:51.980> really<00:03:52.700> don't<00:03:52.850> want<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.060> go<00:03:53.180> any<00:03:53.420> lower<00:03:53.510> than

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
I really don't want to go any lower than

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.780 
I really don't want to go any lower than
this<00:03:54.110> because<00:03:54.530> I<00:03:54.710> don't<00:03:54.980> want<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.250> remove<00:03:55.490> this

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
this because I don't want to remove this

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.080 
this because I don't want to remove this
section<00:03:56.300> here<00:03:58.150> hopefully<00:03:59.150> I'm<00:03:59.360> doing<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
section here hopefully I'm doing the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.490 
section here hopefully I'm doing the
right<00:04:02.240> thing

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.750 

okay<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:09.800> plant<00:04:10.100> could<00:04:10.250> actually<00:04:10.400> be

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
okay this plant could actually be

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.380 
okay this plant could actually be
divided<00:04:11.240> again<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.260> will<00:04:12.500> not<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.950> will<00:04:13.390> keep

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
divided again but I will not I will keep

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.710 
divided again but I will not I will keep
it<00:04:14.540> as<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:15.340> because<00:04:16.340> it's<00:04:16.820> really<00:04:16.940> nice<00:04:17.299> to

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
it as it is because it's really nice to

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.979 
it as it is because it's really nice to
have<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.709> small<00:04:19.400> plant<00:04:19.730> a<00:04:19.880> small<00:04:19.970> oncidium<00:04:20.570> with

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
have a small plant a small oncidium with

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.810 
have a small plant a small oncidium with
as<00:04:21.140> many<00:04:21.290> bulbs<00:04:21.680> as<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:21.950> can<00:04:22.160> in<00:04:22.370> one<00:04:22.550> pot

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
as many bulbs as you can in one pot

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.150 
as many bulbs as you can in one pot
because<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.810> will<00:04:23.960> produce<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.650> lot<00:04:25.100> more

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
because it will produce a lot more

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.190 
because it will produce a lot more
shoots<00:04:25.700> for<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.290> will<00:04:27.650> keep<00:04:28.250> this

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
shoots for you so I will keep this

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.260 
shoots for you so I will keep this
division<00:04:30.200> as<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.770> is<00:04:30.920> I'll<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:31.700> clean<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.150> up

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
division as it is I'll just clean it up

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.400 
division as it is I'll just clean it up
clean<00:04:33.260> up<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.650> dead<00:04:33.800> roots<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:35.720> will<00:04:36.170> pop

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
clean up the dead roots and I will pop

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.080 
clean up the dead roots and I will pop
this<00:04:36.790> as<00:04:37.790> for<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:38.210> one<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:40.190> it's<00:04:41.000> a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
this as for this one I think it's a

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.300 
this as for this one I think it's a
pretty<00:04:41.300> nice<00:04:41.570> division<00:04:42.110> that<00:04:42.440> I<00:04:42.500> can<00:04:42.770> grow<00:04:42.980> and

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
pretty nice division that I can grow and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.690 
pretty nice division that I can grow and
give<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.700> friend<00:04:44.650> okay<00:04:45.650> guys<00:04:45.860> thank<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.520> for
