00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.960
 today we make a special recipe 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:16.719
 it's not particularly strange we go to 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.719
 coat each potato contrà carpagnon 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.980
 we put them on a baking sheet 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.350
 as you can see they are potatoes from 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:32.149
 pretty uniform size and come on 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:35.800
 to put it in the oven for let's say about 40 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.800
 180 degree minutes 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.750
 let's go get our potatoes now 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:56.899
 the problem will only be temperature 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.910
 tending to fusion we open the 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.910
 cartoccio and now what we have to do 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.350
 we have to uncover so let's take 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.350
 a knife we engrave like this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.210
 we create ourselves with the plan plan 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 a space 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.240
 what is this point we all do 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.240
 three 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.760
 Here is our filling 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.030
 we begin to put a spoon of 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.080
 cooked a generous spoonful of 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 mascarpone a little bit of Parmesan cheese e 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.630
 the pancetta we are going to remove all the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:11.920
 outside we send slicing i 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:19.360
 little sticks here we go to 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:22.989
 mix everything ok 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.230
 we get emmental or you can 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.760
 also use gruyere and do as we do 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.760
 for the bacon in the sticks 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.550
 at this point that our plan is 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:52.850
 ready then take a spoonful 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:57.230
 of our filling we push it so here 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:02.570
 we have asiago we put two slices 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.400
 above the sliced ​​bacon then 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.600
 let's do it like a sandwich 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.600
 let's put it this way 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.600
 continue 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.870
 asiago cheese and pancetta lunch 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.870
 it 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:54.819
 cover we must admit last thing 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:59.140
 to make a trickle of oil over some 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:02.890
 rises above and now we go into the oven 180 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.510
 200 degrees for quarter of an hour ten minutes 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:15.700
 time and in any case cheese is 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:17.549
 can melt and let's get in shape but 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.139
 you do n't even need to check 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.940
 perfect the cheese is melting that is 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.110
 wonderful 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.599
 the scent these are our potatoes 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.599
 stuffed with cheese and bacon
