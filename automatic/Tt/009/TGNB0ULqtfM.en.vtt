00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
and champ car coming together it's good

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.339 
and champ car coming together it's good
to<00:01:54.130> give<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.429> a<00:01:54.520> second<00:01:54.999> breath<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:55.959> I<00:01:55.990> think

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
to give it a second breath but I think

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.499 
to give it a second breath but I think
it'll<00:01:56.859> take<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.219> while<00:01:57.549> for<00:01:57.609> it<00:01:58.090> to<00:01:58.119> come<00:01:58.450> back

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
it'll take a while for it to come back

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.620 
it'll take a while for it to come back
because<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.770> takes<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.249> while<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.270> woo<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
because it takes a while to to woo the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.719 
because it takes a while to to woo the
sponsors<00:02:02.289> 22<00:02:03.039> with<00:02:03.279> the<00:02:03.310> television

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
companies but at the end of the day

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.120 
companies but at the end of the day
it's<00:02:07.870> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.229> tough<00:02:08.440> for<00:02:08.649> them<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:09.009> be

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
it's going to be tough for them to be

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.540 
it's going to be tough for them to be
competitive<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> big<00:02:11.170> sense<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:12.100> turn<00:02:12.370> a

competitive in the big sense to turn a

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.730 
competitive in the big sense to turn a
scar<00:02:12.850> because<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.930> had<00:02:14.260> such<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> good

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740

because<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.000> had<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.410> scavenge<00:03:05.410> pump<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:06.280> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
because I had a scavenge pump in the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.979 
because I had a scavenge pump in the
engine<00:03:07.680> seized<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.420> can't<00:03:10.420> remember<00:03:10.870> the

name<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.440> engine<00:03:11.829> but<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> think<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.610> began

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
name of the engine but I think it began

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.240 
name of the engine but I think it began
with<00:03:13.420> F<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.260> might<00:03:14.410> have<00:03:14.440> been<00:03:14.709> for<00:03:15.010> later

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
with F and it might have been for later

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.819 
with F and it might have been for later
oh<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.660> worked<00:03:16.870> with<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.260> company<00:03:17.500> for

to and how do you as an announcer how do

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.740 
to and how do you as an announcer how do
you<00:04:49.520> deal<00:04:49.759> with<00:04:49.789> something<00:04:50.150> like<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.569> you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
you deal with something like that you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.779 
you deal with something like that you
pretty<00:04:51.110> much<00:04:51.199> knew<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.710> guy<00:04:51.860> had<00:04:52.099> had<00:04:52.520> died

a racing driver it's a little easier

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.959 
a racing driver it's a little easier
because<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.449> know<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.699> gravity<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:22.729> the

because you know the gravity of the
accident<00:05:23.509> you<00:05:23.599> actually<00:05:24.050> sometimes<00:05:24.289> have

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
felt it and you've become this close to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.879 
felt it and you've become this close to
that<00:05:27.650> death<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.370> life<00:05:28.759> is<00:05:29.029> very<00:05:29.319> easily<00:05:30.319> taken

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
that death and life is very easily taken

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.570

and<00:05:31.219> these<00:05:31.580> speeds<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.770> when<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.800> saw<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:34.190> it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
and these speeds and when I saw it it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.670 
and these speeds and when I saw it it
