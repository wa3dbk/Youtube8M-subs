my jet boil on a shorter trip with fewer

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
my jet boil on a shorter trip with fewer
people<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.340> usually<00:00:29.490> lighter<00:00:29.880> weight<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
people it's usually lighter weight to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.319 
people it's usually lighter weight to
use<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> canister<00:00:31.140> stove<00:00:31.460> now<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> downside<00:00:33.120> to

use a canister stove now the downside to
doing<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> canister<00:00:34.620> stoves<00:00:34.920> don't<00:00:35.219> work

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
doing this is canister stoves don't work

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.930 
doing this is canister stoves don't work
quite<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.270> well<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.320> snow<00:00:37.760> they<00:00:38.760> don't

sink they become uneven they become
unruly<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.399> manage<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> trick<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> doing

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
unruly to manage so the trick to doing

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
unruly to manage so the trick to doing
this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> hang

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this is I'm gonna have to make a hang

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
this is I'm gonna have to make a hang
out<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.870> old<00:00:49.110> jet<00:00:49.469> boil

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
out of it and this is my old jet boil

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
out of it and this is my old jet boil
you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.370> I've<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:50.820> already<00:00:51.149> made<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can see I've actually already made a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can see I've actually already made a
hanging<00:00:51.960> stove<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
hanging stove out of it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
hanging stove out of it
this<00:00:53.730> particular<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.899> used<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> little

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
this particular one I just used a little

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520 
this particular one I just used a little
bit<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> quarter<00:00:56.010> let<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.430> some<00:00:57.120> duct<00:00:57.449> tape<00:00:57.570> use

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bit of quarter let in some duct tape use

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
bit of quarter let in some duct tape use
a<00:00:58.559> carabiner<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.520> attachment<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.770> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
a carabiner for my attachment point the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
a carabiner for my attachment point the
problem<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> design<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.570> as

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
problem with a design like this is as

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560 
problem with a design like this is as
the<00:01:04.439> stove<00:01:04.739> heats<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.850> duct<00:01:06.150> tape<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the stove heats up the duct tape the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
the stove heats up the duct tape the
adhesive<00:01:07.140> starts<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> heat<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.890> well

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
adhesive starts to heat up as well

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
adhesive starts to heat up as well
starts<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> melt<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> doesn't<00:01:09.570> work<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.869> well

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
starts to melt it doesn't work as well

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230 
starts to melt it doesn't work as well
so<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> couple<00:01:11.130> other<00:01:11.310> options<00:01:11.400> first<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so a couple other options first and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.390 
so a couple other options first and
foremost<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> hang<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> store

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
foremost just use a hang from the store

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.270 
foremost just use a hang from the store
you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.640> buy<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.330> Jetboil<00:01:15.810> or<00:01:16.080> MSR<00:01:16.650> they

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you can buy one from Jetboil or MSR they

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
you can buy one from Jetboil or MSR they
usually<00:01:17.640> only<00:01:17.759> cost<00:01:18.030> anywhere<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.540> ten<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of the other guides use is instead of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
of the other guides use is instead of
using<00:01:27.360> cord<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:27.990> use<00:01:28.170> wire<00:01:28.439> cable<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
using cord they use wire cable and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.749 
using cord they use wire cable and
instead<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> using<00:01:30.240> duct<00:01:30.509> tape<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:31.409> use<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
instead of using duct tape they use a

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
instead of using duct tape they use a
pipe<00:01:32.759> clamp<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.470> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
fumes and the other thing is believe it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.640 
fumes and the other thing is believe it

there<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.630> make<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.810> waterproof<00:02:42.260> allow<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.340> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
there to make it waterproof allow it to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.940 
there to make it waterproof allow it to
catch<00:02:43.610> fire<00:02:43.640> really<00:02:44.210> easily<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.380> don't<00:02:45.770> cook

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
catch fire really easily so I don't cook
