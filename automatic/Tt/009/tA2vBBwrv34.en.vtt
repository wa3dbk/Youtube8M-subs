00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 I just record but I think it gave and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 to the fan of child enters it makes magic her 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.880
 has the function of delimiting the medium and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.520
 external and internal 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.410
 She has my selective woman who 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 means that it will select the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 substances that will enter and exit 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.170
 so this irritation is not a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.570
 organelle size of plasmodium 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.300
 she's just those businesses that we 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 put in there has a plasma belt 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.399
 that cytoplasm is an internal email 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.100
 also bruno is constituted which is what 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.530
 I like to give a plasma belt and a gel 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.210
 that he will stay here crying I put 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.969
 an ice is taking place during class and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.789
 I then put the remaining gel that would be the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 internal medium also white, remembering that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 the membrane is this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 then you have a nucleus and the nucleus in your 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.019
 club rated the core that he 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.979
 store genetic profit profit where 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.170
 Tehran is genetic, it's little luca. 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 then a day later accounts very much 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.740
 the condition these blues continued in the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 memory of the different 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.220
 the cellular respiration function and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
 from it the cell will get the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 energy required for the metabolism to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 from this little thing alone and that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.860
 she will have the energy needed to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 metabolism and then we have the complex 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.390
 gold emergency encyclopedia 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 it has the function of storing 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.000
 substances that are produced by 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.430
 your pet 's urn example is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.939
 the protein and it also has another function 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.719
 that is to produce to produce them the dreams 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.170
 here it is urgent for two of these 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.869
 and used the mark on it 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.780
 I'm responsible for the day, I'm a 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.520
 after the endoplasmic reticulum and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.210
 or smooth endoplasmic reticulum 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.600
 What differs from one another is that the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:20.760
 the publisher of plasma enjoyment and has this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.430
 good are we joined in their fan of them in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.770
 membrane and removals only 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.570
 responsible for the protein synthesis that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.780
 people would be the synthesis of 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.110
 proteins and oh oh oh oh lattice 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 endoplasmic smooth plasma network 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.020
 they have the transport function 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.010
 substances produced by the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.310
 cells 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 then we will have also I already talked with 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.470
 they are me i bought a genius 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.090
 produce the sound and what your dream is 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.080
 dead she responsible for digestion 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.080
 cell phone 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.000
 This one here we'll have the one here 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.990
 It would be a gall but I found nothing to talk about. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.700
 about it 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:07.770
 then we have the feeling between the rains 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.740
 cell division and if we are here it's the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.260
 agreements the nacos they are responsible for 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.560
 for digestion to transform into 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.670
 storage of substances 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 If I said everything without goals, it's them. 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.350
 are present on the wall of the last year 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.120
 plasma with joy remembering the game but 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.890
 these black polka dots are also 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.660
 distributed by the cells 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.910
 Only I put it, but for the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.080
 dots you 'll find your animal 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.080
 this is it 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:04:00.510
 basically that's what advocated today 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:02.760
 shopkeeper today if 5 gold itself the title of the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.560
 amazed with joy is when plasma 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:12.570
 smooth between light bladder very account 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.970
 it is easier to them the homi Tacuru and 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.600
 It has 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:25.100
 plasma membrane volleyball balls 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.950
 future and eating plasma and here 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.510
 inside would be the young cytoplasm in the 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.720
 classic core your cu store load 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.720
 genetics
