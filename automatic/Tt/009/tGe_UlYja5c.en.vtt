00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
you can tap the screen to bring up the

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:22.149 
you can tap the screen to bring up the
menu<00:01:19.249> and<00:01:19.729> we<00:01:19.789> can<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.959> know<00:01:21.139> make<00:01:21.709> the<00:01:21.889> font

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
menu and we can you know make the font

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.209 
menu and we can you know make the font
bigger<00:01:23.469> to<00:01:24.469> make<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.619> little<00:01:24.829> bit<00:01:24.920> easier<00:01:25.189> to

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
bigger to make a little bit easier to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.090 
bigger to make a little bit easier to
read<00:01:25.749> you<00:01:26.749> can<00:01:26.899> also<00:01:27.049> change<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.889> line

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
read you can also change the line

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.190 
read you can also change the line
spacing<00:01:28.340> if<00:01:28.819> you<00:01:28.939> want<00:01:29.119> big<00:01:29.329> spacing<00:01:29.810> or<00:01:29.959> small

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
spacing if you want big spacing or small

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.590 
spacing if you want big spacing or small
spacing<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.249> actually<00:01:31.579> changes<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.090> margin

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
spacing this actually changes the margin

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.870 
spacing this actually changes the margin
so<00:01:32.779> the<00:01:32.899> margins<00:01:33.439> get<00:01:33.649> smaller<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.789> smaller

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
so the margins get smaller and smaller

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.109 
so the margins get smaller and smaller
or<00:01:35.509> if<00:01:35.599> you<00:01:35.719> want<00:01:35.899> them<00:01:35.990> bigger<00:01:36.200> okay<00:01:37.119> change

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
or if you want them bigger okay change

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.120 
or if you want them bigger okay change
our<00:01:38.299> font<00:01:38.539> here<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:39.529> we<00:01:39.619> have<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> couple<00:01:40.069> of

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
our font here so we have a couple of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.219 
our font here so we have a couple of
options<00:01:40.310> there<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.759> she's<00:01:41.749> a<00:01:41.779> pretty<00:01:42.079> good

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
options there that she's a pretty good

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.899 
options there that she's a pretty good
fine<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.859> and<00:01:43.490> then<00:01:43.609> we<00:01:43.670> have<00:01:43.789> our

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
fine like that and then we have our

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.339 
fine like that and then we have our
brightness<00:01:44.240> right<00:01:44.509> here<00:01:44.840> we<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.170> actually

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
brightness right here we can actually

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.339 
brightness right here we can actually
dim<00:01:46.069> it<00:01:46.189> down<00:01:46.219> with<00:01:46.609> low<00:01:46.849> or<00:01:46.880> make<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.959> nice<00:01:48.139> and

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
dim it down with low or make it nice and

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:49.749 
dim it down with low or make it nice and
bright<00:01:48.469> depending<00:01:48.889> on<00:01:49.009> how<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.369> better<00:01:49.609> for

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
bright depending on how it is better for

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.879 
bright depending on how it is better for
you<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.029> read<00:01:50.209> and<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.109> definitely<00:01:51.649> recommend

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
you to read and I definitely recommend

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:53.559 
you to read and I definitely recommend
take<00:01:52.219> advantage<00:01:52.609> of<00:01:52.759> these<00:01:52.909> features<00:01:53.359> because

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
take advantage of these features because

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.109 
take advantage of these features because
if<00:01:53.779> you<00:01:53.869> switch<00:01:54.259> from<00:01:54.679> white<00:01:54.889> to<00:01:54.919> black<00:01:55.130> this

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
if you switch from white to black this

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.120 
if you switch from white to black this
black<00:01:56.450> look<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:56.990> actually<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.380> better<00:01:57.619> look<00:01:57.979> for

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
black look is actually a better look for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.129 
black look is actually a better look for
when<00:01:58.279> you're<00:01:58.369> reading<00:01:58.549> at<00:01:58.939> night<00:01:59.599> like<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.020> the

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
when you're reading at night like in the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.449 
when you're reading at night like in the
dark<00:02:00.319> you<00:02:00.619> wouldn't<00:02:00.859> want<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.099> screen<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.340> be

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
dark you wouldn't want the screen to be

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:02.830 
dark you wouldn't want the screen to be
so<00:02:01.639> bright<00:02:01.909> because<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.299> would<00:02:02.389> actually<00:02:02.539> kind

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
so bright because it would actually kind

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.809 
so bright because it would actually kind
of<00:02:02.989> mess<00:02:03.109> up<00:02:03.289> your<00:02:03.439> eyes<00:02:03.590> or<00:02:03.950> not<00:02:04.399> mess<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:04.729> up

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
of mess up your eyes or not mess it up

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.010 
of mess up your eyes or not mess it up
but<00:02:04.969> it<00:02:05.090> would<00:02:05.209> kind<00:02:05.359> of<00:02:05.389> make<00:02:05.509> your<00:02:05.599> eyes<00:02:05.749> hurt

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
but it would kind of make your eyes hurt

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.749 
but it would kind of make your eyes hurt
so<00:02:06.679> this<00:02:06.829> is<00:02:06.979> kind<00:02:07.219> of<00:02:07.249> like<00:02:07.399> for<00:02:07.609> your

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
so this is kind of like for your

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.219 
so this is kind of like for your
low-light<00:02:08.179> setting<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.840> also<00:02:08.959> have

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
low-light setting and you also have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.949 
low-light setting and you also have
sepia<00:02:09.649> which<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.039> kind<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:11.060> good<00:02:11.270> complement

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
sepia which is kind of a good complement

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.430 
sepia which is kind of a good complement
of<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.140> two<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.720> that's<00:02:14.720> kind<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.960> how<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.140> do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
of the two so that's kind of how you do

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.059 
of the two so that's kind of how you do
the<00:02:15.590> settings<00:02:16.010> here
