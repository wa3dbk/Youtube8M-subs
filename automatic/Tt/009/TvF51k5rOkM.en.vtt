00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.880
 but made about it and worked commercially last year 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.520
 Movie 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.210
 had been earlier 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.020
 the euro wins out 0 0 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 the interview was 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.840
 Dr is also famous, at least in quarantine 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.730
 if the limbo is now 83 most of his life like that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.149
 Company cars constructed almost every day he has worked overtime 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.009
 Holger soil would be laid on what 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.009
 8,000 euros per year 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 Columban Luser but justifiable someday are safe 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.920
 his former colleague Joachim Nagel tells Weichert 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.759
 his best coworker had been a little later both have many 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.659
 Cars put the finishing touches on Joachim Nagel came to Karmann as 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.659
 the Giants was already produced on the assembly line 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 I would never have had that long ball for one one can stay but 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.900
 the product has then addressed me with the activity as 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.510
 Project Manager Essen gives no light for me no nicer 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.440
 To carry out activity as this 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.030
 because you just the whole very rare 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.640
 that the aging his wife's first thought go a product 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 accompany to serial production 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.819
 a series product 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.469
 the great Karmann Ghia in the jargon of the type 34 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.280
 he has his birthday today exactly 50 years ago became the first model 

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.100
 presented 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.309
 Altogether more than 42 thousand of them were off the line 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.999
 Kassenschlager was the little brother of Georg Zipfel find that was even found 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 over 300000 produced 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.819
 a little later drew on a design for the dialect 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.629
 that was VW too fast 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.749
 but the drawing had been canceled if everything here has collector value for it 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:35.000
 he has until his retirement Netzer 92 but all the cars on this 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.029
 Image constructed 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:41.189
 That's where it began with the demise of her employer Karmann from Osnabr端ck 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.189
 Reason because new CEOs are the old hands 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.880
 rewarded with effort 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.749
 I already have such a strange idea 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.859
 because of our good contact with our products order and that 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.699
 was always the privilege round of Anklamer long have the principal 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.509
 basically right 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.540
 and then everything changed. "The dykes make up my arrogance 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.959
 can 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.939
 the beginning of the end of the automotive supplier 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.939
 in June 2009, the last car rolled out of the house came on the band no hunting 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.419
 but a Mercedes most of the employees were fired 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.799
 those who are still there look different to the company than the guys from the 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.129
 golden times real difference 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.799
 and most of all that they have from Homburger those who have stayed there 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.019
 today the bleeding need to raise your arms 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.419
 Now you can be with her at the courage and driver already in the morning 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.809
 and if you're there before it spreads thanks to huge in louvers waiting for me 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.319
 Five weeks have to have a Santa Claus the Greeks there 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.569
 a cult car VW Karmann Ghia was still the relationship between Karmann and VW 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.209
 alright now is hand came history instead VW has its in the Altenwerk 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.869
 Location Osnabr端ck opened 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.829
 even the classic cars from the collection belong now exists 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.499
 What still shines on Karmann because only these memorabilia
