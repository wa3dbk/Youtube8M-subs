00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
out in the rain it's rusty as you can
see<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.649> put<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.189> wd-40<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
see I actually put a little wd-40 on the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.260 
see I actually put a little wd-40 on the
rail<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.899> good<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> new<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.180> other

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
rail and it's good as new and the other

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
rail and it's good as new and the other
thing<00:01:54.360> about<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> um<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.829> these<00:01:56.009> clamps

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
thing about this is um with these clamps

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
thing about this is um with these clamps
if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.020> serrated<00:01:58.500> edge

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
if you can see this has a serrated edge

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
if you can see this has a serrated edge
on<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.850> which<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.630> helps<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.960> gripping

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on here which really helps the gripping

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
on here which really helps the gripping
power<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.520> thing<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.939> harbor<00:02:03.210> freight<00:02:03.479> one

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
power this thing the harbor freight one

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.539 
power this thing the harbor freight one
for<00:02:03.990> example<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.680> doesn't<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.490> I'm

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
for example it doesn't have that so I'm

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.760 
for example it doesn't have that so I'm
thinking<00:02:05.790> that's<00:02:05.850> part<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> reason<00:02:07.290> for

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
thinking that's part of the reason for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.020 
thinking that's part of the reason for
this<00:02:07.890> next<00:02:08.129> problem<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> bring<00:02:08.879> up

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
this next problem going to bring up

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.530 
this next problem going to bring up
which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.649> fact<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.450> there's<00:02:12.450> no

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
which is on the fact that there's no

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
which is on the fact that there's no
gripping

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
gripping

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500 
gripping
or<00:02:13.560> when<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.890> thing<00:02:14.130> before<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.180> thing<00:02:15.360> was

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
or when this thing before this thing was

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.960 
or when this thing before this thing was
broke<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.560> clamping<00:02:17.130> gripping<00:02:17.490> power<00:02:17.700> was

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
broke the clamping gripping power was

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.440 
broke the clamping gripping power was
pretty<00:02:18.420> much<00:02:18.540> non-existent<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.590> mean<00:02:19.890> um<00:02:20.450> it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
pretty much non-existent I mean um it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.360 
pretty much non-existent I mean um it
would<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.810> would<00:02:21.840> hold<00:02:22.140> something<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
would it would hold something but I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.840 
would it would hold something but I
never<00:02:23.970> tried<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> use<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:25.610> anything<00:02:26.610> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
never tried to use it for anything that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.170 
never tried to use it for anything that
I<00:02:27.030> needed<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:29.180> superb

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I needed it out like some superb

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.090 
I needed it out like some superb
gripping<00:02:30.630> power<00:02:30.840> for<00:02:31.080> because<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.560> saw<00:02:31.830> right

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
gripping power for because I saw right

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.210 
gripping power for because I saw right
away<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.820> all<00:02:33.630> gets<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> point<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.830> you

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
away that it all gets to a point and you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.520 
away that it all gets to a point and you
really<00:02:35.490> can't<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.940> any<00:02:36.180> tighter<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:37.290> I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
really can't get any tighter because I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.990 
really can't get any tighter because I
think<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.130> main<00:02:38.280> thing<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.520> probably<00:02:38.700> because

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
think the main thing is probably because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.510 
think the main thing is probably because
that's<00:02:39.180> rated<00:02:39.480> edge<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.080> fact<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.520> yeah

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
that's rated edge and the fact that yeah

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790 
that's rated edge and the fact that yeah
this<00:02:41.760> thing<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.209> seems<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.600> crap<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.530> um

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
this thing just seems like crap so um

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.370 
this thing just seems like crap so um
yeah<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.720> need<00:02:45.870> something<00:02:46.080> to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
yeah for so if you need something to

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.140 
yeah for so if you need something to
like<00:02:46.530> maybe<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.070> crafts<00:02:47.520> or<00:02:47.730> something

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
like maybe do like crafts or something

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.990 
like maybe do like crafts or something
the<00:02:48.360> harbor<00:02:48.690> freight<00:02:49.190> clamp<00:02:50.190> right<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:50.970> I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the harbor freight clamp right here I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.300 
the harbor freight clamp right here I
think<00:02:51.330> may<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.080> worth<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
think may be worth it but if you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.530 
think may be worth it but if you
seriously<00:02:53.790> need<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.360> some

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
seriously need to do like some

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.140 
seriously need to do like some
construction<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.730> seriously<00:02:56.730> need<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.910> clan

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
construction and seriously need to clan

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.620 
construction and seriously need to clan
something<00:02:57.570> together<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.180> get

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
something together this is what you get

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.760 
something together this is what you get
so<00:03:01.700> harbor<00:03:02.700> freight<00:03:02.940> clamps<00:03:03.450> bad<00:03:04.760> things
