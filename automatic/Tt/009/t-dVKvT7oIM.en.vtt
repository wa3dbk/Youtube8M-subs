00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.499
 The absorption of local anesthetics is directly related 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.499
 with the following factors 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.089
 the greatest social condemnation are 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.480
 ph in the medinense 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.589
 the pk 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 local anesthetic is the toll 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.100
 and he did not see the other's faces 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.360
 to the north cca the fraction notification and cadaquÃ©s may 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.700
 so the accident rate faster 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.650
 since the form did not see or behind the drug is the one that interact in the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.180
 block 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.540
 at lower ph the start of actions slower since there is less action not 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 identified 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.710
 The higher the volume 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.120
 greater that to its action and therefore its passage to the bloodstream 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 taking into account the minimum inhibitory confrontation 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 nerve conduction 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
 tribal war 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.290
 we can overcome it but we recommend the use of anesthetics without exceeding the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.760
 thesis 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.890
 We were born stipulated 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.670
 the trend of the past in their developed children 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.850
 are those 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.480
 with the least concentration 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.010
 possible and its administration that larger volumes 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.280
 decreasing in degrees 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.280
 there were its effects 2 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.700
 the anesthetic distribution is made directly to 0 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.530
 been pasteurized 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.170
 and it happens to the tissues in function 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 physical-chemical properties already commented 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.430
 with local will be different 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.619
 the moncloa drop lidocaine 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.779
 Hindu Celtic a garbage 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.779
 so its action will increase 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.779
 the metabolization of friends is done through the liver 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 where it becomes 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.399
 that is why we believe that a weak 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.409
 this patient with the duck madrid 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.919
 which will present more time of 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.419
 and therefore increased risk of systemic toxicity
