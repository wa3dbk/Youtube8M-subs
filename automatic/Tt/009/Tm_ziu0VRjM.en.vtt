00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
wrapping them in a towel will suffice so

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.290 
wrapping them in a towel will suffice so
you<00:05:08.080> get<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.230> nice<00:05:08.350> thick<00:05:08.650> towel<00:05:08.890> wrap<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.580> place

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
you get a nice thick towel wrap it place

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.780

wrench pop those off and then off comes
the<00:05:50.170> blade<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.470> again<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.280> like<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.580> put<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
the blade and again I like to put the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.490 
the blade and again I like to put the
bolts<00:05:52.180> right<00:05:52.360> back<00:05:52.570> through<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.960> blade<00:05:53.200> holes

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
bolts right back through the blade holes

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.200 
bolts right back through the blade holes
so<00:05:53.800> you<00:05:53.860> know<00:05:54.070> exactly<00:05:54.520> where<00:05:54.700> they<00:05:54.820> are<00:05:54.850> and

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
so you know exactly where they are and

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.439 
so you know exactly where they are and
then<00:05:56.020> same<00:05:56.710> goes<00:05:56.980> wrap<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.700> the<00:05:57.790> towel<00:05:58.000> and

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
then same goes wrap it in the towel and

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.570 
then same goes wrap it in the towel and
they<00:06:00.259> should<00:06:00.469> be<00:06:00.499> protected<00:06:01.009> that<00:06:01.099> way<00:06:01.249> so

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
they should be protected that way so

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.489 
they should be protected that way so

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
marks to make sure where this edge is

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.159 
marks to make sure where this edge is
this<00:06:24.770> end<00:06:25.520> of<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.639> jig<00:06:26.029> and<00:06:26.300> coming<00:06:26.870> down<00:06:26.990> this

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
this end of the jig and coming down this

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.850 
this end of the jig and coming down this
end<00:06:27.439> two<00:06:28.430> marks<00:06:28.789> again<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.360> with<00:06:30.110> this<00:06:30.319> jig<00:06:30.680> he

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
end two marks again and with this jig he

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.679 
end two marks again and with this jig he
has<00:06:30.979> two<00:06:31.279> bars<00:06:31.520> in<00:06:31.759> the<00:06:31.849> middle<00:06:32.089> so<00:06:32.449> you<00:06:32.509> want

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
has two bars in the middle so you want

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.149 
has two bars in the middle so you want
to<00:06:32.749> make<00:06:32.779> sure<00:06:32.900> you<00:06:33.139> have<00:06:33.259> your<00:06:33.289> bars<00:06:33.650> labeled

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
either left or right as well as the end

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.249 
either left or right as well as the end
pieces<00:06:36.979> the<00:06:37.669> end<00:06:37.819> pieces<00:06:38.029> can<00:06:38.479> go<00:06:38.689> on<00:06:38.960> either

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
pieces the end pieces can go on either

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.829 
pieces the end pieces can go on either
way<00:06:40.189> so<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:40.849> want<00:06:41.089> to<00:06:41.180> make<00:06:41.210> sure<00:06:41.330> that<00:06:41.749> you

the same way every time if you set your

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.010 
the same way every time if you set your
jig<00:06:46.400> up<00:06:46.520> a<00:06:46.639> little<00:06:46.849> bit<00:06:46.969> differently<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.749> may

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
jig up a little bit differently you may

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.290 
jig up a little bit differently you may
not<00:06:48.199> get<00:06:48.439> a<00:06:48.680> square<00:06:49.490> edge<00:06:49.699> the<00:06:49.969> first<00:06:50.180> few

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
not get a square edge the first few

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.850 
not get a square edge the first few
times<00:06:50.479> you<00:06:50.629> sharpen<00:06:51.080> because<00:06:51.259> it<00:06:51.379> may<00:06:51.529> be<00:06:51.680> off

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
times you sharpen because it may be off
