00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good to all youtube friends 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.200
 welcome again my channel and here you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.349
 I bring a 2.0 again a long time ago 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.139
 I did not bring it and well what better occasion 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.509
 what to bring with this new microphone with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 these almost 10,000 subscribers that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.199
 many of you is the first time 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 see me you will say and this guy who does 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 up on the right talking yes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.609
 also some of this I make gameplays 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.560
 commented is what we 're going for so 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.750
 which one I started on YouTube after I got 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.809
 the ideas of the parodies occurred 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.730
 musicals and good the reason that there's no 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 another musical parody is because my 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
 throat does not leave me there is the thing the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.450
 I have a bit resentful I will do 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.579
 I'm not going to do it 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.469
 more times I will record that of how it is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 because I do not want to force the throat to 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.079
 see if I can get up tomorrow and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.879
 to record and do everything right I 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.590
 I will take the necessary time to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.350
 the parody is perfect so do not miss 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.840
 I can say how long it will take for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 leave the next but that here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 I already have the lyrics I will not teach 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.370
 so it's not a bit of a surprise because 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.100
 as you know they are parodies 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.050
 already known for it to be a little 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.730
 surprise then the case that I have it already 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.130
 written the lyrics I just have to sing it 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.050
 but that's the thing my throat does not 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.230
 it leaves me a moment to see if tomorrow 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.580
 we can do and all very well and good 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.650
 for all I was going to say followers 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.590
 followers I 'm not subscribers that in the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.420
 background is the same as giving you the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.800
 thanks as I said before the video by 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.660
 all that support as you have visited 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.780
 possibly without you I would not be 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.760
 doing this right now and good this 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.400
 it helps me move forward 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.650
 in all this musical parodies 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 they cost me a lot since I do not know if 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 you will know the cell for musical of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.190
 a song already known 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.110
 you have to make the bases of zero 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.910
 you can not catch the musical foundations of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.190
 the artists themselves because if you do not 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.590
 skip the copyright even so much more 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.780
 high many times the copyright being 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.960
 that is created all by myself that is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.390
 that I do not take anything original I know that just 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 to the song but it's like a cover and I 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.620
 assaults the copper and even going up only 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.130
 to me the clue of my voice is worth it or I 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.870
 I picked up is recorded and jumps to copete 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.850
 That 's weird and it went up alone in my voice 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.580
 It's worth without music and well I also 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 I took as the cup and rhythm of the song 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.950
 something very strange the truth is that I 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.530
 happened on youtube then that's why there's 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.770
 what to do takes a long time to see where 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.830
 fails to see where the copyright jumps and why 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.910
 that many times makes the songs 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.280
 they worsen so to speak in quotes 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.700
 because you have to change certain things 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.680
 and they do not look so much like the original that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.390
 is the reason and as I say in a few days 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.970
 you will have the new parody I hope that you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.760
 so much like the one of the me to champion that which is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.120
 very difficult because I sincerely 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.220
 condice the one of the me to encamp and thought that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.159
 well yes I said host for medel currado 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.650
 It has cost me a lot to do it 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.019
 but I say the same if it reaches ten thousand 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.430
 cool reproductions you know 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.950
 is now more than 300,000 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.220
 reproductions a barbarity I know that I 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.409
 it's going to cost a lot to get over that parody 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.780
 both in visits and in quality but it 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.700
 will try not and hopefully and i am 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.980
 aware and I think that I will overcome 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.110
 well I tell you the feel parodies hopefully 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.400
 can overcome that parody go 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.340
 surpassing every day that's what it's about 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.690
 learning new things 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.190
 taking ideas from the people who made this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.010
 uncle because he does not do it because he does not 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.900
 you do so many people have given me 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.209
 many ideas the truth and I appreciate it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.920
 an outrage since it is about 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.700
 help us say a little bit between all 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.069
 and even if I put it together, it's only helped 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 all over the world so to speak and that 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.640
 that as I have told you this is the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.849
 new microphone I will show you 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.239
 in detail in the 10,000 thousand special 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.849
 subscribers not thousand 10,000 that is said 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.410
 soon 10,000 but we count 123 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.570
 up to 10,000 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.280
 of people that I have out there that many 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.500
 thank you for continuing to support and that is 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.240
 true the shed as I have all the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.040
 chiringuito be mounted look at this be 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.940
 the old microphone is worth what 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.180
 I will teach in detail in the setup and 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.910
 I tell you I 'm now at 9,800 soon 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.280
 we will arrive imagine tomorrow or past 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 I believe that last 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.050
 we will reach 10,000 and use the setup 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.790
 of how I have everything assembled here I have a 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.620
 huge foot which is what he used to 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.889
 I pick up the microphone I put it up there 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.720
 to sing and see how it goes, I think 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.690
 that the next stop I hope it comes out 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.430
 much better than the previous ones since the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.990
 Being new micro audio quality will 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.930
 better and I think that that will give 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.370
 more quality in the whole song 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.200
 than the previous ones that was with the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 microphone and me this is a micro that 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.390
 it did not cost me 15 euros minus one and what 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.460
 I bought the truth I had it at home and 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.170
 that I will show you everything in detail and 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.020
 well here the game is over you see that 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.720
 I wanted to raise her up because the 28 5 and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.060
 You see my team that I've done nothing at all 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.880
 game with the most packages with the most 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.770
 banks, yes there you can see it has been 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.300
 totally disaster but if I wanted 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.290
 teach a game so you can see 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.420
 the people that now that I have to play 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.640
