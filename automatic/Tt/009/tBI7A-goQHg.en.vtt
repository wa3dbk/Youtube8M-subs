00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and cities dotted along the way I also

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.359

arriving<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.309> Pangaea<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.690> find<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
arriving on Pangaea and I find that a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.260 
arriving on Pangaea and I find that a
lot<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> towns<00:00:35.010> look<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.550> similar

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
lot of towns look very similar

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
lot of towns look very similar
I<00:00:36.530> mean<00:00:37.530> towns<00:00:38.250> tend<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> stick<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> same

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
I mean towns tend to stick to the same

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
I mean towns tend to stick to the same
fashion<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.230> putting<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> big<00:00:41.399> building<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.910> the

fashion of putting a big building in the

most minecraft towns take these days

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
most minecraft towns take these days
which<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.239> perfectly<00:01:00.600> fine<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.230> why

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
which is perfectly fine by the way why

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
which is perfectly fine by the way why
would<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:02.370> automatically<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.390> that

would you not automatically think that

would you not automatically think that
way<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.710> hating<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.250> towns<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.640> all

way I'm not hating on these towns at all

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.179 
way I'm not hating on these towns at all
I'm<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.090> pointing<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> fact<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> many

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
I'm just pointing out the fact that many

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'm just pointing out the fact that many
towns<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.700> built<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> same<00:01:09.360> grid<00:01:09.689> or

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
towns are built on the same grid or

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
towns are built on the same grid or

keeping<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> typical<00:01:17.220> themes<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.850> must<00:01:18.540> be

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on the ground have one or two floors a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
on the ground have one or two floors a
flat<00:01:21.390> roof<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.979> perfectly<00:01:23.340> fine

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
flat roof which is also perfectly fine

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
flat roof which is also perfectly fine
and<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.890> against<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and I know this is going against the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
and I know this is going against the
first<00:01:26.520> episode<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.210> they're<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.570> becoming

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
first episode but they're just becoming

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490 
first episode but they're just becoming
a<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:28.470> monotonous<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:30.720> asked<00:01:30.900> me<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> review

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
a bit monotonous you asked me to review

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
a bit monotonous you asked me to review
your<00:01:31.770> house<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:33.240> already<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> good

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
your house and I already have a good

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
your house and I already have a good
idea<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> will<00:01:35.009> look<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
idea of what it will look like this in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.359 
idea of what it will look like this in
some<00:01:36.900> cases<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> bad<00:01:37.920> thing

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
some cases is a bad thing

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.690 
some cases is a bad thing
so<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.479> better<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.920> no<00:01:41.460> clue

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so it's better for me to have no clue

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
so it's better for me to have no clue
about<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.680> build

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
about what I'm going to see so the build

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
about what I'm going to see so the build
will<00:01:44.070> put<00:01:44.280> forward<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> builders<00:01:45.110> creativity

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
will put forward the builders creativity

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
will put forward the builders creativity
more<00:01:46.470> strongly<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.180> overall<00:01:48.180> improve<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
more strongly and overall improve the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.789 
more strongly and overall improve the
design<00:01:50.210> basically<00:01:51.210> towns<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> cities<00:01:52.530> are

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
design basically towns and cities are

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
design basically towns and cities are
starting<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> look<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> same<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.000> eyes<00:01:54.200> not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
starting to look the same in my eyes not

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.530

for<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> next<00:04:56.330> episode<00:04:56.540> in<00:04:57.080> which<00:04:57.440> I'll<00:04:57.590> be

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
for the next episode in which I'll be

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.130 
for the next episode in which I'll be
talking<00:04:57.770> about<00:04:58.190> organic<00:04:58.700> builds<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.450> then

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
talking about organic builds and then

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.350 
talking about organic builds and then
after<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.560> we'll<00:05:00.890> have<00:05:00.920> one<00:05:01.490> possibly<00:05:02.180> about

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
after that we'll have one possibly about

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.840 
after that we'll have one possibly about
color<00:05:02.720> palettes<00:05:03.140> so<00:05:03.460> there's<00:05:04.460> lots<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.700> look

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
color palettes so there's lots to look

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.540 
color palettes so there's lots to look
forward<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:06.860> good<00:05:07.070> if<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.460> actually

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
forward to and it's good if I actually

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.100 
forward to and it's good if I actually
to<00:05:07.760> say<00:05:07.910> what's<00:05:08.150> coming<00:05:08.390> up<00:05:08.450> in<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.600> future

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
to say what's coming up in the future

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.740 
to say what's coming up in the future
because<00:05:09.950> it<00:05:10.190> will<00:05:10.340> coerce<00:05:10.820> me<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:11.390> make<00:05:11.570> them

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
because it will coerce me to make them

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.640 
because it will coerce me to make them
but<00:05:12.350> of<00:05:12.470> self-motivation<00:05:13.400> right<00:05:13.700> there

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650
