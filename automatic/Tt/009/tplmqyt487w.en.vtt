00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
realistic than some of them that we've

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.319 
realistic than some of them that we've
seen<00:04:13.979> in<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.129> past<00:04:14.220> however<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:15.150> doesn't

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
seen in the past however it doesn't

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.180 
seen in the past however it doesn't
feature<00:04:15.659> those<00:04:16.049> wooden<00:04:16.409> tables<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.010> those

feature those wooden tables that those

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.060

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
when you look at it it definitely looks

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.430 
when you look at it it definitely looks
like<00:05:13.340> something<00:05:13.729> that<00:05:14.419> Apple<00:05:14.930> would<00:05:15.050> design

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
like something that Apple would design

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.469
