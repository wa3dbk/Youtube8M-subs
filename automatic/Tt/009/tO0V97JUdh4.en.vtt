 take a deep breath 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.129
 hands above the table and let's 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.649
 begin to come from the comic simons 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.719

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 researched and wikipedia and as long as it you 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.880
 against is therefore the body is not the roon 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.830
 is that a six-year-old child in the comic? 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.360
 is not at 0 yet 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.090

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 beautiful skyline of staging square we 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.020
