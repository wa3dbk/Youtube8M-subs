00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.800
 review when I load 100 subscribers 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.510

 the quick so they pass better so get it 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.309
 take a deep breath 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.129
 hands above the table and let's 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.649
 begin to come from the comic simons 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.719
 first problem they have everyone in it 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.550
 high and twelve years 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.530
 and a six year old and yes I have it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 researched and wikipedia and as long as it you 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.880
 against is therefore the body is not the roon 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.830
 is that a six-year-old child in the comic? 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.360
 is not at 0 yet 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.090
 so in our first picture we see the 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 beautiful skyline of staging square we 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.020
 fly nac that doesn't insinuate at all 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.740
 that in the second picture also what I am 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.960
 into trouble 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.790

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.440
 make as disturbed as me someone 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.290

 development and then sonic xxx 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.870

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 fight with one 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.900

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.360
 put milk in a kind of him 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.110
 sometimes communicates with nichols who are busy 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.650

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.390
 men here just look at 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.380
 I started 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.349
 partly factor 10 why they never do this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.269
 have done before 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.670
 because you have to go to the playgroup 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.569

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.769

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.780

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.519
 spot seeing his mother 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.539
 partly says he has no idea of â€‹â€‹an isn 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.729
 voltage translated because he likes the chiny 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.220
 docs need to keep wondering about what's here 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.320
