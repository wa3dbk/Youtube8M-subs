and I can find Gouda it took me a while

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.090 
and I can find Gouda it took me a while
and<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:43.110> thought<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:46.200> need<00:01:46.680> something

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
but because of the weight restrictions

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.010 
but because of the weight restrictions
cheese<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.580> idleness<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.510> because<00:01:57.900> he

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
cheese of idleness and that's because he

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
cheese of idleness and that's because he
couldn't<00:01:58.260> see<00:01:58.440> it<00:01:58.650> was<00:01:58.800> their<00:01:58.979> clue<00:01:59.220> or<00:01:59.610> our

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.570 
couldn't see it was their clue or our
cheese<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.570> he<00:02:00.840> guess<00:02:01.050> our<00:02:01.410> changements<00:02:02.100> not

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
and so after a little while we thought

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.499 
and so after a little while we thought
we<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> find<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.910> solution<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.420> this
