00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.519
 Different crest boots 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.519
 Cute piano 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.260
 Two types of games are released this time 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:19.160
 I say I like a guy the same table Dabobiru students bite is I have a six 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.230
 Of course more and better 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.690
 Of course what does that child do with something? Of course it also hears about the change of appearance 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.240
 Though 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.980
 By interference of play 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.579
 I hoped that gameplay would change rapidly 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.350
 For example 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:42.070
 Playing specific first Datte shellfish have become accustomed to the kettle is not have a gun 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:47.050
 If you say medical khan inside is set up abandoned 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.530
 Ai switched to him so far that the attacked enemy became a fire so far with a gun at a distance 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.420
 I will 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.050
 Come rapidly approaching bamboo bong 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.420
 It will change 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.989
 It's like you're just fighting against the enemy and the situation is changing in an instant 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.969
 To 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.930
 Naa wanted to do this time 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.930
 I have to say well the kind of change Te 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 Hmm 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.950
 everyone 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.009
 Three 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.000
 Does this story is independently 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.290
 Hatoyama made one by one like this 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.490
 To Speaking in 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 Oh come at all 5-1 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.520
 Peek to about little bitty what little size of up to NISHII 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.350
 Because it is other than the martial arts which there is also a reservation 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 It's fun to do each 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:41.020
 This time, each character is on the beach as if it were a large outbreak. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.400
 Though it does not mean that it will become a final one 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.370
 Yes something in particular that one of the key 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.730
 Higashi Ward 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.330
 And Kama' required 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.330
 If you get 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.479
 me 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:03.730
 First of all, I am changing that submission in various ways 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.340
 There are many kinds of stories of fear but this time we are unique to rice 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.060
 For example, waist 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 It is a concrete of shrimp 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 N horror walk a strong space 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.090
 In 9 groups 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 Always say that being chased by someone fear and Iuko cormorant say individual 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.630
 We've had one after the mad masu first to say that offended sued 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.850
 So after all the player character has so much personality so how to fight too 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.720
 We write various things and prepare each one as good 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.300
 The guy who wrote 20 times 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.410
 First of all I was really aiming for that 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.520
 It is said that we want to make a game only for the game action which has been very action action 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.440
 Not necessarily 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.010
 For that you can make horror 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.489
 It means that we chose the best operation 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.489
 Overwintering that can sing in the country 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.550
 I is Kaiserslautern become possible new action-packed because there is the action 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.420
 I I'm I think Na whether that Tteyuu fear what taste there still 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.890
 I said this before 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.670
 Damn the scene and shoot a gun while Nekorobi 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.670
 And so 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:22.200
 It wasn't improved because the previous method of operation was bad, so the best words in life 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.000
 The Pick to and at the time of joy is the direction to make also still new horror game of 6 this time 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.950
 Because you told me choices 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.590
 Well there is no one who can respond 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.590
