00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.139
 other than the injury made his debut during the match time you 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 baby broadcasts there are more talk to him 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 Amersfoort choose what you disagree with the group 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.810
 great culture 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.940
 but the match was kicked in 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 just open the workout before both appear 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.810
 it was in the base of the crew that I started several times 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.210
 it is there that the jellyfish I suspect I was not sick of course but 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 see who told that also with little man had a big chance 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 but I note that he is sure that the debate stood 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.910
 7 next 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.799
 spring on the weighted 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.989
 It is, of course, a big change for me in the promises 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.940
 a limitation in the base 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.280
 and market it to the difficult 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.150
 Marchen suggested the day before the game 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.350
 gosh yeah i see i see i have something special is that the sun 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 so not just went to school every morning and then 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.890
 game played in the evening 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 and provided that she was in class that is pleasant 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.729
 but that match message 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 the koters is not so easy I think 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380
 Gent has not won the Greeks for the playoffs 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.510
 de and that you also saw a mix to appoint and 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.630
 the experts cannot be denied 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.960
 although the reactions after the game 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 schools predominantly positive thinking 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.680
 I looked at it myself and it was with the management and 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.710
 far too complex of appreciation and it was noticed that it is nice to 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.560
 to hear 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 that is the rate that members are 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 triad I do not know the same that it was Eastern Africa 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.850
 and in any case 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.960
 according to is a past in situ gintung dam 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.180
 we can see that the bus is being discussed what we expect next year 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 would extend her contract yes 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.100
 I decide I experienced a lot and I am also 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.800
 That is also the reason that brands sound
