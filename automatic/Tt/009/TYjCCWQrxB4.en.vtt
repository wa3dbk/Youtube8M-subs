people<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.690> understand<00:00:41.109> I<00:00:41.559> think<00:00:41.769> when<00:00:42.129> people

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
people to understand I think when people

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.950 
people to understand I think when people
don't<00:00:42.609> understand<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.210> it's<00:00:43.539> because<00:00:43.840> they

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
don't understand that it's because they

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200 
don't understand that it's because they
don't<00:00:44.140> want<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.550> then<00:00:45.850> there's<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.149> know

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210
