 classic apple style which is not 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 years but still they risked 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.920

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 enter the def mode and so that these breaths 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.170
 but it's all being trumpeted 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 first turn off the device so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.119
 turned off waiting for a complete shutdown 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.119
 devices 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.610
 so our device has disconnected now 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.220
 Now let's move on to defy mode and so on for 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.640
 this need to hold down the shutdown button 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.380
 power on and home button 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.080
 hold them for about 10 seconds and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:02.300
 counting time two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.210
