as<00:04:42.970> we're<00:04:43.150> playing<00:04:43.390> Barcelona<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.350> realized<00:04:44.650> a

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
as we're playing Barcelona I realized a

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.440 
as we're playing Barcelona I realized a
really<00:04:45.220> unique<00:04:45.370> style<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.790> play<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.150> was<00:04:46.240> just

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
really unique style of play it was just

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.150 
really unique style of play it was just
like<00:04:46.630> how<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.290> first<00:04:47.530> team<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.740> Boston

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
like how the first team of Boston

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.040 
like how the first team of Boston
players<00:04:48.520> like<00:04:48.790> Chevy<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.330> yeste<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.780> Messi

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
players like Chevy and yeste and Messi

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.630 
players like Chevy and yeste and Messi
play<00:04:50.550> on<00:04:51.550> defense<00:04:52.180> they<00:04:52.540> closed<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.680> really

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
play on defense they closed in really

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.360 
play on defense they closed in really
quickly<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.360> makes<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.140> really<00:04:56.830> hard<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.160> play

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
quickly and makes it really hard to play

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.840 
quickly and makes it really hard to play
out<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:58.170> on<00:04:59.170> when<00:05:00.070> they're<00:05:00.310> attacking

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
out of and on when they're attacking

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.840 
out of and on when they're attacking
they<00:05:01.480> really<00:05:02.350> switched<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.710> bull<00:05:03.040> credibly

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
they really switched the bull credibly

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.830 
they really switched the bull credibly
fast<00:05:05.070> Barcelona<00:05:06.120> came<00:05:07.120> with<00:05:07.420> what<00:05:07.660> looked

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
fast Barcelona came with what looked

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.090

and<00:05:11.440> they<00:05:12.190> created<00:05:12.910> chances<00:05:13.330> but<00:05:13.450> we<00:05:13.600> also

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
and they created chances but we also

a hard time with that we had some pace
up<00:05:21.580> top<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.790> they<00:05:22.120> couldn't<00:05:23.110> deal<00:05:23.290> with<00:05:23.320> and

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
up top that they couldn't deal with and

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.710

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
our guys played really really well and

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.200 
our guys played really really well and
committed<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.460> possession<00:05:27.460> rather<00:05:27.700> than<00:05:27.940> just

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
committed to possession rather than just

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.210 
committed to possession rather than just
bailing<00:05:29.020> ourselves<00:05:29.500> out<00:05:29.620> by<00:05:29.800> playing<00:05:30.070> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
bailing ourselves out by playing the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.860 
bailing ourselves out by playing the
ball<00:05:30.370> over<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.670> top<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:31.060> running<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.570> I'm

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
ball over the top and running so I'm

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.350 
ball over the top and running so I'm
really<00:05:32.530> pleased<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:33.070> them<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:34.000> think<00:05:34.210> it's
