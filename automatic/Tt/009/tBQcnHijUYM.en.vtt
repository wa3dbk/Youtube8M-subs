Hey, I'm Bartek from howtojuggle.com.pl, in this video I'm going 
 to teach you the Mills Mess pattern.  

00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:17.738
A small mistake in the video - every throw is 
 made to the inside. 
Upcoming exercises are OK.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.304
Let's start with one ball. If you can juggle quite well, 
 start from 4th exercise - link on the screen.

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:33.012
If you are a beginner - start from the 1st exercise. 
 There will be three steps with one ball. 

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.727
And then we'll make some exercises with two and three balls. 

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:40.517
Cross your forearms, toss the ball to the other 
 side with the hand which is above.

00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:50.928
After the toss, switch your hands and catch 
 with the other hand (still above). 

00:00:55.018 --> 00:01:10.535
Still with one ball - do the motion you see 
 on the screen. Your hand goes 360 degrees

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:23.494
Hand is above the other one, then 360 degrees, then under 
 the arm toss, catch with the other hand. 

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:27.798
Now in this exercise, hold the ball in the hand which is below.

00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:49.880
Uncross your arms, then toss the ball vertically, cross your arms again with hands 
 switched and catch with the hand that is below the other one. 

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:56.850
Time for 2 balls - that's the position. 

00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:06.640
Now toss the ball which is above with your arms crossed. 
 Then uncross and toss the other ball after it. 

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:13.400
Now cross your arms with your hands switched. The ball which was above 
 is still above, but it's caught by the other hand. 

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:22.540
See that is slow motion.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:35.660
Now the hands are uncrossed. Right hand tosses the ball vertically but a little bit to the middle of the pattern. 
 Cross your arms then and toss the ball a little bit to the middle after the first ball. 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:54.470
I don't toss them to the middle, sorry for that. 
 It's quite important for the whole pattern. 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.120
For this step you'll need to master the 4th step.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.460
Now add the third ball as I show. 

00:03:07.462 --> 00:03:10.990
Two balls are caught in the hand that's above the other one. 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:21.750
See that in slow motion. 

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.810
Now as you can see - all tosses are to the inside. 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.390
If you still can't perform that - it's the sign that you 
 have to go to the 4th step for a while

00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:36.710
In the 7th step add the next toss. It also implicates the 
 change from left to right or from right to left. 

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:44.910
Now see that and later in slow motion. So after 
 this you basically end with the same situation. 

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:16.760
And in the 8th step don't catch two balls in one hand. Just try to 
 juggle without a pause. Or pause if your pattern starts to deteriorate. 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:23.300
Or you can do 6 tosses as I show. And then add next. 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:49.450
Thanks for watching - hope that helps you. Again sorry for the tosses which aren't made 
 to the middle of the pattern. See you in the next videos !
