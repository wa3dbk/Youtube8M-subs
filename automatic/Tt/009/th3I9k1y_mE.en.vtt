00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
everything's going on it's got the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.460 
everything's going on it's got the
typical<00:00:37.090> payment<00:00:37.360> servant<00:00:37.600> grindstone<00:00:38.019> but

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
typical payment servant grindstone but

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.259 
typical payment servant grindstone but
also<00:00:38.650> has<00:00:38.920> like<00:00:39.190> since<00:00:39.790> these<00:00:39.879> vines<00:00:40.090> hop

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
also has like since these vines hop

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.340 
also has like since these vines hop
counter<00:00:40.570> balance<00:00:40.900> because<00:00:41.050> our<00:00:41.140> counter

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
counter balance because our counter

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.720 
counter balance because our counter
balance<00:00:41.559> curve<00:00:41.739> is<00:00:41.860> insane<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.430> just<00:00:42.580> has

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
balance curve is insane it just has

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.670 
balance curve is insane it just has
basically<00:00:43.360> everything<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:43.809> could<00:00:43.960> want<00:00:44.080> in<00:00:44.320> a

deck also ska band welder right yeah

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.140 
deck also ska band welder right yeah
there's<00:00:47.559> just<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.920> call<00:00:48.549> this<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.879> grixis

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
there's just I call this that grixis

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.180 
there's just I call this that grixis
painter<00:00:49.540> because<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.170> mean<00:00:50.350> that's<00:00:50.680> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
painter because it I mean that's the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.619 
painter because it I mean that's the
closest<00:00:51.549> I<00:00:51.610> could<00:00:51.670> come<00:00:51.760> up<00:00:52.000> with<00:00:52.120> what<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:52.510> is

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
closest I could come up with what it is

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.320 
closest I could come up with what it is
at<00:00:52.750> its<00:00:52.900> core<00:00:53.080> but<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.799> course<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.820> painter

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
at its core but of course the painter

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.670 
at its core but of course the painter
the<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.839> painter<00:00:56.019> servant<00:00:56.320> grindstone

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
the the painter servant grindstone

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.710 
the the painter servant grindstone
package<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.580> almost<00:00:57.970> like<00:00:58.120> an<00:00:58.269> afterthought

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
package it's almost like an afterthought

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.680 
package it's almost like an afterthought
there<00:00:59.619> actually<00:00:59.739> are<00:01:00.220> only<00:01:00.580> two<00:01:01.360> painter

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
there actually are only two painter

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.020 
there actually are only two painter
servants<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.260> one<00:01:02.470> grindstone<00:01:03.010> which<00:01:03.580> you

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
servants and one grindstone which you

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.520 
servants and one grindstone which you
just<00:01:04.239> kind<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.420> eventually<00:01:04.720> find<00:01:05.199> when<00:01:05.409> you're

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
just kind of eventually find when you're

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.560 
just kind of eventually find when you're
good<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:05.680> ready<00:01:05.799> I<00:01:06.010> suppose<00:01:06.340> yeah<00:01:06.760> it's<00:01:07.060> you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
good and ready I suppose yeah it's you

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.780 
good and ready I suppose yeah it's you
it's<00:01:08.080> basically<00:01:08.470> almost<00:01:08.799> a<00:01:09.070> back-up<00:01:09.369> plan<00:01:09.400> but

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
it's basically almost a back-up plan but

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.039 
it's basically almost a back-up plan but
it's<00:01:09.880> also<00:01:10.030> your<00:01:10.270> main<00:01:10.450> plan<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:10.810> just<00:01:10.960> have

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
it's also your main plan you just have

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.300 
it's also your main plan you just have
to<00:01:11.170> figure<00:01:11.290> out<00:01:11.470> how<00:01:11.619> you<00:01:11.680> can<00:01:11.890> set<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.220> up

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to figure out how you can set it up

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.039 
to figure out how you can set it up
through<00:01:12.970> everything<00:01:13.240> else<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.659> if<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:13.869> good

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
through everything else and if it's good

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.539 
through everything else and if it's good
enough<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.439> that<00:01:14.470> game<00:01:14.890> state<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.369> you're<00:01:15.490> in

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
enough in that game state that you're in

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.330 
enough in that game state that you're in
currently<00:01:16.060> right<00:01:16.420> okay<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.200> if<00:01:17.650> your<00:01:18.159> if<00:01:18.310> your

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
currently right okay so if your if your

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
currently right okay so if your if your
main<00:01:18.610> game<00:01:18.850> plan<00:01:19.090> if<00:01:19.540> you're<00:01:19.660> not<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:19.900> let

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
main game plan if you're not just let

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.270 
main game plan if you're not just let
you<00:01:20.080> know<00:01:20.140> jamming<00:01:20.470> for<00:01:20.650> beach<00:01:20.800> combo<00:01:21.100> piece

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
you know jamming for beach combo piece

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.860 
you know jamming for beach combo piece
then<00:01:21.490> you've<00:01:22.210> got<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> couple<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.720> other

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
then you've got a couple of other

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.140 
then you've got a couple of other
engines<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.950> suppose<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.310> kind<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.910> tie<00:01:25.000> that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
engines I suppose that kind of tie that

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.870 
engines I suppose that kind of tie that
act<00:01:25.300> together<00:01:26.280> primarily<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:27.520> get<00:01:27.640> for

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
act together primarily that you get for

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.880 
act together primarily that you get for
sensei's<00:01:28.330> divining<00:01:28.450> top<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:29.560> for<00:01:29.740> three

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
sensei's divining top and then for three

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.750 
sensei's divining top and then for three
counterbalance<00:01:30.430> you've<00:01:30.550> got<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
counterbalance you've got the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.230 
counterbalance you've got the
counterbalance<00:01:31.330> top<00:01:32.230> package<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.430> would<00:01:34.210> you

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
counterbalance top package so would you

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.550 
counterbalance top package so would you
say<00:01:34.390> that's<00:01:34.510> kind<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.140> glue<00:01:35.530> that

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
say that's kind of the the glue that

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.320 
say that's kind of the the glue that
holds<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.950> deck<00:01:36.070> together<00:01:36.220> uh<00:01:36.820> it's

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
holds the deck together uh it's

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.120 
holds the deck together uh it's
definitely<00:01:38.050> helps<00:01:38.350> because<00:01:38.560> it<00:01:38.770> gives<00:01:38.890> us

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
definitely helps because it gives us

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.830 
definitely helps because it gives us
like<00:01:39.310> all<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.670> time<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:39.940> need<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.210> set<00:01:40.360> up<00:01:40.510> once

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
like all the time we need to set up once

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.170 
like all the time we need to set up once
we<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.770> stable<00:01:42.310> assuming<00:01:43.090> they<00:01:43.150> don't

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
we have it stable assuming they don't

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.820 
we have it stable assuming they don't
like<00:01:43.450> boys<00:01:43.630> rampant<00:01:44.260> or<00:01:44.350> anything<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.710> can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
like boys rampant or anything we can

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.410 
like boys rampant or anything we can
just<00:01:44.860> infinitely<00:01:45.370> by<00:01:45.610> time<00:01:45.850> because<00:01:46.150> our<00:01:46.240> curb

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
just infinitely by time because our curb

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210 
just infinitely by time because our curb
is<00:01:46.600> great<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.960> counterbalance<00:01:47.530> sure<00:01:47.830> so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
is great for the counterbalance sure so

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.340 
is great for the counterbalance sure so
the<00:01:48.250> more<00:01:48.700> time<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> combo<00:01:49.180> deck<00:01:49.300> has<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.810> kill

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the more time a combo deck has to kill

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.810 
the more time a combo deck has to kill
somebody<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.860> better<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.400> obviously

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
somebody the better that is obviously

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.340 
somebody the better that is obviously
okay<00:01:52.150> yes<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:52.690> kind<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.900> stretching<00:01:53.260> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
okay yes it's kind of stretching the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.740 
okay yes it's kind of stretching the
game<00:01:53.500> out<00:01:53.650> yeah<00:01:54.550> yo<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.090> course<00:01:55.600> for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
game out yeah yo for course for

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.080 
game out yeah yo for course for
lightning<00:01:56.080> bolt<00:01:56.230> for<00:01:56.500> force<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.830> will<00:01:57.090> just

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
lightning bolt for force of will just

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.480 
lightning bolt for force of will just

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
kind of good cards in that sense so to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.620 
kind of good cards in that sense so to
make<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.760> game<00:02:00.880> lasts<00:02:01.060> longer<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.450> answer

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
make the game lasts longer to answer

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
make the game lasts longer to answer

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
play against with a stack

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.860 
play against with a stack
I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:30.580> any<00:04:30.880> like<00:04:31.120> storm<00:04:31.450> combo<00:04:31.720> deck

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
I think any like storm combo deck

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.650 
I think any like storm combo deck
because<00:04:32.020> they're<00:04:32.140> faster<00:04:32.500> than<00:04:32.590> us<00:04:32.740> okay

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
because they're faster than us okay

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.630 
because they're faster than us okay
elves<00:04:34.660> might<00:04:34.840> be<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.960> bit<00:04:35.140> faster<00:04:35.470> too<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.010> when

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
elves might be a bit faster too and when

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.740 
elves might be a bit faster too and when
I<00:04:36.670> came<00:04:36.760> into<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.090> sermon<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.360> did<00:04:37.480> not<00:04:37.600> want<00:04:37.690> to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
I came into the sermon I did not want to

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.910 
I came into the sermon I did not want to
play<00:04:37.870> against<00:04:38.050> like<00:04:38.170> bugged<00:04:38.350> over<00:04:38.650> him<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
play against like bugged over him to

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.190 
play against like bugged over him to
architects<00:04:39.310> right<00:04:39.760> okay<00:04:40.060> all<00:04:40.270> right<00:04:41.050> so

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
architects right okay all right so

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.920 
architects right okay all right so
basically<00:04:41.530> other<00:04:42.490> kind<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.060> unfair<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.600> Texas

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
basically other kind of unfair is Texas

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.630 
basically other kind of unfair is Texas
it<00:04:44.020> cuz<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.260> doesn't<00:04:44.620> really<00:04:44.710> feel<00:04:44.830> unfair<00:04:45.430> I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
it cuz it doesn't really feel unfair I

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.740 
it cuz it doesn't really feel unfair I
guess<00:04:45.850> it's<00:04:46.000> more<00:04:46.120> like<00:04:46.210> right<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:46.540> black

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
guess it's more like right all black

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.590 
guess it's more like right all black
than<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.140> combo<00:04:47.440> deck<00:04:47.620> uh<00:04:48.190> yeah<00:04:48.880> it's<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.330> a

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
than a combo deck uh yeah it's like a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600 
than a combo deck uh yeah it's like a
control<00:04:50.140> deck<00:04:50.260> with<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.410> back<00:04:50.620> up<00:04:50.800> like<00:04:51.400> a<00:04:51.490> back

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
control deck with a back up like a back

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.790 
control deck with a back up like a back
a<00:04:51.640> package<00:04:52.060> okay<00:04:52.420> so<00:04:52.900> basically<00:04:52.990> combo<00:04:53.590> decks
