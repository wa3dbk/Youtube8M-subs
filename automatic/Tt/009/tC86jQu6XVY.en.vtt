00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we're going to thread it in between the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.390 
we're going to thread it in between the
other<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.160> jacks<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.229> pre<00:01:04.680> honestly

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.830 

it's<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.549> okay<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.479> you've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
between so again you can push it all the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.300 
between so again you can push it all the
way<00:01:11.880> through<00:01:12.229> okay<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.770> once<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
way through okay and once it's in

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850 
way through okay and once it's in
between<00:01:14.720> all<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.170> hold<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
between all we do is to just hold it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.359 
between all we do is to just hold it
with<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.220> fingers<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.640> watch<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.990> ace

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
with our fingers and watch is the ace

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.289 
with our fingers and watch is the ace
just<00:01:21.229> flips<00:01:22.229> itself<00:01:22.650> upside<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.180> can

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
just flips itself upside down as you can

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.700 
just flips itself upside down as you can
probably<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> middle<00:01:25.530> card

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
probably see that is the middle card

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.050 
probably see that is the middle card
just<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:27.470> put<00:01:28.470> outside<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
just there to put outside there's the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
just there to put outside there's the
other<00:01:30.119> two<00:01:30.329> jacks<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
other two jacks and you can do is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.429 
other two jacks and you can do is
slightly<00:01:32.220> differently<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.840> do

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
slightly differently as off you can do

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
slightly differently as off you can do
so<00:01:34.650> also<00:01:34.950> thinks<00:01:35.490> we've<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> ACE<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so also thinks we've got the ACE on a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.039 
so also thinks we've got the ACE on a
bomb<00:01:36.479> King<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> pull<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.979> ace<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:39.049> we

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
bomb King we do is pull the ace up we

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
bomb King we do is pull the ace up we
can<00:01:40.259> turn<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> deck<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:43.399> thread<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.549> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
can turn the deck so I thread it in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.469 
can turn the deck so I thread it in
between<00:01:44.790> again<00:01:45.509> might<00:01:46.409> take<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.619> while

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
between again might take a while

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.870 
between again might take a while
really<00:01:49.479> really<00:01:49.570> can't<00:01:49.780> get<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.880> perfect

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
really really can't get it perfect

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.319 
really really can't get it perfect
yourself<00:01:52.469> hey<00:01:53.469> who<00:01:54.340> shot<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:54.670> white<00:01:54.850> throw<00:01:55.119> k

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
yourself hey who shot on white throw k

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.630 
yourself hey who shot on white throw k
and<00:01:55.600> all<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.140> do<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:57.100> hold<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
and all we do is we just hold it to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.819 
and all we do is we just hold it to
starting<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.149> shake<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.539> again<00:01:58.899> and<00:01:59.079> look<00:01:59.590> as

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
starting to shake it again and look as

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.910 
starting to shake it again and look as
the<00:02:00.280> ace<00:02:00.460> in<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.909> middle<00:02:01.179> turns<00:02:01.990> red<00:02:02.380> just

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
the ace in the middle turns red just

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.080 
the ace in the middle turns red just
shut<00:02:03.100> up<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.549> weaving<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.909> ACE

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
shut up and that is a weaving the ACE

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.569 
shut up and that is a weaving the ACE
okay
