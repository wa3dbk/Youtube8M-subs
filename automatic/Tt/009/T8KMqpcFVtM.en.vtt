anyway<00:00:58.680> did<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> took<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> little

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
anyway did that for you took a little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
anyway did that for you took a little
extra<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.449> done<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
extra time done that and then also the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
piece of plastic so I went ahead and did

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
piece of plastic so I went ahead and did
some<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> blue<00:01:09.420> chrome<00:01:09.720> paint<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.380> some

some like a blue chrome paint and some
eyes<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.670> Ian<00:01:11.970> touch-ups<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> look<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
eyes and Ian touch-ups make it look a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
eyes and Ian touch-ups make it look a
bit<00:01:13.020> more<00:01:13.290> realistic<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.070> well<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
bit more realistic in there as well I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.010 
bit more realistic in there as well I
don't<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.170> mind<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> did<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> but

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
don't think your mind that I did it but

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.210 
don't think your mind that I did it but
anyway<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> took<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.350> liberty<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
anyway I took the liberty to do it I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
anyway I took the liberty to do it I
also<00:01:20.900> can't<00:01:21.900> tell<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> camera

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
also can't tell it on the camera

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.870 
also can't tell it on the camera
very<00:01:23.939> well<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.409> put<00:01:25.409> some<00:01:25.439> blue<00:01:26.310> chrome<00:01:26.610> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
very well but put some blue chrome on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.469 
very well but put some blue chrome on
the<00:01:27.200> leg<00:01:28.200> net<00:01:28.729> what<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.880> probably<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the leg net what would probably be the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.319 
the leg net what would probably be the
lug<00:01:30.630> nut<00:01:30.840> covers<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:32.310> don't<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.150> well

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
lug nut covers I don't know how well

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
lug nut covers I don't know how well
they're<00:01:33.420> showing<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.960> maybe<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> light<00:01:34.799> helps

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
they're showing up maybe the light helps

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.830 
they're showing up maybe the light helps
or<00:01:35.280> hurts<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.759> anyway<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.000> don't<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
or hurts but anyway I don't know and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.219 
or hurts but anyway I don't know and
then<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.159> bed<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> body<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
then down the bed of the body of the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.469 
then down the bed of the body of the
truck<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.540> used<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:44.180> orange<00:01:45.180> chrome

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
truck I used some of the orange chrome

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
truck I used some of the orange chrome
paint<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> side<00:01:47.040> lights<00:01:47.369> side

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
paint to go over the side lights side

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
paint to go over the side lights side
marker<00:01:48.420> lights<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:50.430> also

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
marker lights on as well you also

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
marker lights on as well you also
actually<00:01:50.939> changed<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.630> light<00:01:52.110> bar<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.500> hit

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
actually changed the light bar and hit

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually changed the light bar and hit
that<00:01:52.710> vector<00:01:52.920> style<00:01:53.340> light<00:01:53.520> bar<00:01:53.759> how<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.090> was

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that vector style light bar how this was

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.069 
that vector style light bar how this was
in<00:01:54.450> Whalen<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.710> older<00:01:56.030> or<00:01:57.030> maybe<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> federal

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in Whalen or an older or maybe a federal

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.359 
in Whalen or an older or maybe a federal
buddy<00:01:58.229> line<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.740> both<00:01:58.890> made<00:01:59.130> one

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
buddy line I think they both made one
