be talking about the biggest price drop
in<00:00:04.410> camera<00:00:05.130> history<00:00:05.970> probably<00:00:12.290> now<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.440> may

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
in camera history probably now this may

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.410 
in camera history probably now this may
be<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> biggest<00:00:13.950> price<00:00:14.250> drop<00:00:14.519> however<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.120> not

the<00:00:27.029> camera<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.769> sd1<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> 15

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the camera was the sd1 and it was a 15

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.530 
the camera was the sd1 and it was a 15
megapixel<00:00:31.140> camera<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.340> wasn't<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.969> 15

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
megapixel camera but it wasn't really 15

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720 
megapixel camera but it wasn't really 15
megapixels<00:00:34.079> well<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.489> tried<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
megapixels well it was but they tried to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
megapixels well it was but they tried to
claim<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> was<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> 46<00:00:37.200> megapixel

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
claim it was actually a 46 megapixel

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
claim it was actually a 46 megapixel
camera<00:00:38.340> effectively<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.329> got<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> completely

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
camera effectively it's got a completely

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
camera effectively it's got a completely
different<00:00:40.290> type<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> sensor<00:00:41.430> from<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
different type of sensor from what you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
different type of sensor from what you
get<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> normal<00:00:42.570> cameras<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.500> instead<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
get in normal cameras where instead of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.200 
get in normal cameras where instead of
having<00:00:45.410> pixel<00:00:46.410> holes<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.789> green

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
having pixel holes it's got a green

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
having pixel holes it's got a green
pixel<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.930> red<00:00:49.289> pixel<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> blue<00:00:50.670> pixel

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
pixel a red pixel and then a blue pixel

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.900 
pixel a red pixel and then a blue pixel
or<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.809> position<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.860> top<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.579> each<00:00:53.730> other

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
or in some position on top of each other

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.650 
or in some position on top of each other
and<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.520> in<00:00:56.520> total<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.000> looks<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.300> fifteen

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and so in total it looks like fifteen

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.990 
and so in total it looks like fifteen
butter<00:00:57.930> pecan<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.280> image<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.969> be

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
butter pecan it the image can be

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 
butter pecan it the image can be
interpolated<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> forty<00:01:02.219> six<00:01:02.579> megapixel

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
interpolated into a forty six megapixel

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.479 
interpolated into a forty six megapixel
some<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> texts<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.559> reviews<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.100> donuts

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
some of the texts and reviews of donuts

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
some of the texts and reviews of donuts
should<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.540> made<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> group

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
should that actually only made a group

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
should that actually only made a group
of<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.200> thirty<00:01:07.799> megapixels<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of about thirty megapixels not really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.600 
of about thirty megapixels not really
forty-six<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.900> thirty<00:01:10.140> was<00:01:10.320> great<00:01:10.650> however

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
forty-six but thirty was great however

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.510 
forty-six but thirty was great however
it<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.060> an<00:01:12.150> aps-c<00:01:12.659> size<00:01:13.350> sensor<00:01:13.380> camera<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it was an aps-c size sensor camera so it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
it was an aps-c size sensor camera so it
wasn't<00:01:14.700> even<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> full-frame<00:01:15.570> camera

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wasn't even like a full-frame camera

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.670 
wasn't even like a full-frame camera
it<00:01:16.590> had<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.520> video<00:01:17.909> functions<00:01:18.360> whatsoever<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it had no video functions whatsoever so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.899 
it had no video functions whatsoever so
it's<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.159> much<00:01:20.549> still

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it's just all very much still

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
it's just all very much still
photography<00:01:21.479> only<00:01:21.750> his<00:01:22.229> ISO<00:01:22.770> range<00:01:23.040> was<00:01:23.220> okay

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
photography only his ISO range was okay

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.410 
photography only his ISO range was okay
it's<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:24.030> 100<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:25.369> 6400<00:01:26.369> however<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it's from about 100 to 6400 however the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's from about 100 to 6400 however the
noise<00:01:27.659> tests<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> were<00:01:28.439> done<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.920> didn't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
noise tests that were done on it didn't

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
noise tests that were done on it didn't
show<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> too<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:31.259> exposure

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
show it too well and also exposure

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
show it too well and also exposure
seemed<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> lot<00:01:32.460> darker<00:01:32.790> compared<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
seemed to be a lot darker compared to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.719 
seemed to be a lot darker compared to
not<00:01:33.869> another<00:01:34.380> sensor<00:01:34.860> having<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> same

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
not another sensor having the same

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.240 
not another sensor having the same
settings<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:37.140> frames<00:01:37.409> per<00:01:37.710> second<00:01:38.159> were

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
settings and it's frames per second were

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.649 
settings and it's frames per second were
pretty<00:01:38.610> pop<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:39.390> only<00:01:39.420> like

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
pretty pop I think there's only like

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.920 
pretty pop I think there's only like
three<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> half<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.159> four<00:01:41.270> frames<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.450> second

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
three and a half or four frames a second

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
three and a half or four frames a second
so<00:01:43.619> you're<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.220> gonna<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> using<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so you're not really gonna be using it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090 
so you're not really gonna be using it
for<00:01:44.850> sports<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.079> sensor<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.799> had<00:01:46.979> about

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
for sports and the sensor only had about

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.120 
for sports and the sensor only had about
eleven<00:01:47.899> focus<00:01:48.899> points<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.590> well<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
eleven focus points on it as well so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300 
eleven focus points on it as well so
again<00:01:50.640> hmm<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.560> amazing<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
again hmm not that not amazing but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.639 
again hmm not that not amazing but
however<00:01:53.670> its<00:01:53.939> price<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:55.350> nearly

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
however its price at the time was nearly

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.100 
however its price at the time was nearly
five<00:01:57.049> thousand<00:01:58.049> pounds<00:01:59.899> everyone<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:00.990> kind

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
five thousand pounds everyone was kind

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.399

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
expensive overpriced camera let's drop

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.289 
expensive overpriced camera let's drop
the<00:02:33.629> price<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.079> they<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.409> dropped<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.040> are

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
gonna buy it the actual sensor itself is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.619 
gonna buy it the actual sensor itself is
potentially<00:03:34.229> a<00:03:34.319> very<00:03:34.620> good<00:03:35.359> sensor<00:03:36.359> however

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
potentially a very good sensor however

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.719 
potentially a very good sensor however
the<00:03:37.139> amount<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.530> money<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.069> technology<00:03:38.609> has

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
the amount of money and technology has

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.629 
the amount of money and technology has
been<00:03:38.819> put<00:03:39.060> behind<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:40.009> hasn't<00:03:41.009> been<00:03:41.129> nearly<00:03:41.489> as

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
been put behind it hasn't been nearly as

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.259 
been put behind it hasn't been nearly as
much<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:42.000> what's<00:03:42.209> been<00:03:42.389> pumped<00:03:42.900> into<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:44.269> CMOS

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
much as what's been pumped into the CMOS

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.559 
much as what's been pumped into the CMOS
sensors<00:03:45.750> from<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.530> Canon<00:03:47.189> and<00:03:47.310> Nikon<00:03:47.569> the

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
sensors from like Canon and Nikon the

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.619 
sensors from like Canon and Nikon the
other<00:03:48.720> thing<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.259> camera<00:03:49.620> body<00:03:49.979> itself

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
other thing is the camera body itself

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.149 
other thing is the camera body itself

weird I like where its buttons are and

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.530 
weird I like where its buttons are and
what<00:03:55.590> functions<00:03:56.189> are<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.519> how<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.669> can<00:03:56.909> set

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
what functions are and how you can set

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.469 
what functions are and how you can set
the<00:03:57.689> exposure<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.349> manual<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.060> you<00:04:00.060> know<00:04:00.180> all

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
the exposure and manual and you know all

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.089 
the exposure and manual and you know all
that<00:04:00.689> kind<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.959> stuff<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.470> was<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:01.919> bit

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
that kind of stuff it was just a bit

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.089 
that kind of stuff it was just a bit
naff<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.970> none<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.139> has<00:04:04.530> changed<00:04:04.560> so

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
naff and none of that has changed so

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.550 
naff and none of that has changed so
then<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.669> fit<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.180> still<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.659> now<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
then a fit are still as now the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.710 
then a fit are still as now the
functions<00:04:08.159> are<00:04:08.370> exactly<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.359> same<00:04:09.389> as<00:04:09.569> what

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
functions are exactly the same as what

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.719 
functions are exactly the same as what
it<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.349> specifications<00:04:11.250> are<00:04:11.400> exactly

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
it was the specifications are exactly

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.520 
it was the specifications are exactly
there<00:04:11.879> was<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.299> price<00:04:12.540> has<00:04:13.019> massively

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
there was the price has massively

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.399 
there was the price has massively
dropped<00:04:13.889> is<00:04:14.699> anyone<00:04:15.150> gonna<00:04:15.239> buy<00:04:15.479> it<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.780> don't

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
dropped is anyone gonna buy it I don't

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.379 
dropped is anyone gonna buy it I don't
think<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.009> it<00:04:17.340> an<00:04:17.430> interesting<00:04:17.759> one<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.239> see

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
think so is it an interesting one to see

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.659 
think so is it an interesting one to see
the<00:04:18.509> technology<00:04:19.409> of<00:04:19.440> sensor<00:04:20.039> development<00:04:20.310> in

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
the technology of sensor development in

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.750 
the technology of sensor development in
a<00:04:20.760> different<00:04:21.090> direction<00:04:21.209> yes<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.529> is<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.729> a

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
a different direction yes it is is it a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.210 
a different direction yes it is is it a
good<00:04:24.029> direction<00:04:24.469> not<00:04:25.469> at<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.830> moment

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
good direction not at the moment

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.560 
good direction not at the moment
because<00:04:26.400> nobody<00:04:26.790> else<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.090> really<00:04:27.330> following

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
because nobody else is really following

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.110 
because nobody else is really following
it<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.140> because<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.340> it's<00:04:29.640> not<00:04:29.910> really

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
it and because of that it's not really

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.030 
it and because of that it's not really
developing<00:04:30.660> at<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> same<00:04:31.110> pace<00:04:31.350> as<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
developing at the same pace as the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.590 
developing at the same pace as the
others<00:04:32.370> CMOS<00:04:32.730> sensors<00:04:33.150> are<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.300> getting<00:04:33.540> in

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
others CMOS sensors are you getting in

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.840 
others CMOS sensors are you getting in
other<00:04:33.750> cameras<00:04:34.170> but<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:35.130> would<00:04:35.280> be<00:04:35.430> nice<00:04:35.580> is

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
other cameras but what would be nice is

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.120 
other cameras but what would be nice is
if<00:04:36.330> all<00:04:36.690> their<00:04:36.930> cat<00:04:37.170> camera<00:04:37.740> companies

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
if all their cat camera companies

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.700 
if all their cat camera companies
thought<00:04:38.850> oh<00:04:39.060> wow<00:04:39.480> luke<00:04:39.840> signal<00:04:40.320> I've<00:04:40.440> dropped

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
thought oh wow luke signal I've dropped

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.490 
thought oh wow luke signal I've dropped
their<00:04:40.950> camera<00:04:41.280> by<00:04:41.840> 3000<00:04:42.840> pounds<00:04:43.170> let's<00:04:43.410> do

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
their camera by 3000 pounds let's do

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.650 
their camera by 3000 pounds let's do
that<00:04:43.680> as<00:04:43.890> well<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.700> imagine<00:04:45.000> if<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.240> Nick<00:04:45.510> on

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
that as well so imagine if the Nick on

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.740 
that as well so imagine if the Nick on
d4<00:04:46.110> something<00:04:46.530> went<00:04:46.680> from<00:04:46.880> 5,000<00:04:47.880> don't<00:04:48.660> you

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
d4 something went from 5,000 don't you

00:04:48.750 --> 00:05:03.600 
d4 something went from 5,000 don't you
mm<00:04:49.260> Oh<00:04:50.090> Maisie<00:04:51.800> never<00:04:52.800> gonna<00:04:52.890> happen

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610
