entirety but I just finished a game
nexus<00:00:08.820> where<00:00:09.000> like<00:00:09.750> there<00:00:10.320> are<00:00:10.410> five<00:00:10.559> or<00:00:10.710> six

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
nexus where like there are five or six

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.669 
nexus where like there are five or six
members<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.460> blue<00:00:11.639> team<00:00:11.790> they<00:00:11.880> were<00:00:11.940> hacking

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
members of blue team they were hacking

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
members of blue team they were hacking
it<00:00:13.679> was<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.130> quite<00:00:14.309> fun<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.759> try<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> defeat

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
it was it was quite fun to try to defeat

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.740 
it was it was quite fun to try to defeat
the<00:00:15.780> super<00:00:16.410> mob<00:00:16.560> hacker<00:00:17.130> bosses<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.359> come

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the super mob hacker bosses but I come

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.120 
the super mob hacker bosses but I come
I've<00:00:19.020> come<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.410> idea<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.070> this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I've come with an idea and I think this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.230 
I've come with an idea and I think this
is<00:00:20.189> something<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:20.939> would<00:00:21.150> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
is something that really would it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
is something that really would it
benefit<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.199> teeming<00:00:22.920> aspect<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
benefit the teeming aspect of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.160 
benefit the teeming aspect of
annihilation<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.720> I'm<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> put<00:00:25.080> on

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
annihilation and so I'm going to put on

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.540 
annihilation and so I'm going to put on
my<00:00:25.199> channel<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> guys<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:26.070> tell<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
my channel and you guys can tell me what

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.200 
my channel and you guys can tell me what
you<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.230> annihilation

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
you think I think that in annihilation

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
you think I think that in annihilation
you<00:00:30.210> should<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.740> experience<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.949> shop

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you should get experience not shop

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.120 
you should get experience not shop
experience<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.910> levels<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> game

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
experience but like levels in the game

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
experience but like levels in the game
by<00:00:35.130> guarding<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> Nexus<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> stand

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
by guarding the Nexus so if you stand

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
by guarding the Nexus so if you stand
near<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.899> Nexus<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.530> feel<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.250> should<00:00:38.280> be

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
near the Nexus I feel like you should be

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.900 
near the Nexus I feel like you should be
gaining<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.750> certain<00:00:40.079> amount<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> ambient

pretty good yeah that way I think that I
mean<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> beacon<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.690> way

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
mean you got a beacon there that way

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.289 
mean you got a beacon there that way
people<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:05.010> reason<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.700> stand<00:01:06.030> around

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

people have more reason to stand around
and<00:01:06.689> protect<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.150> at<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> same<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.479> they're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and protect and at the same time they're

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
and protect and at the same time they're
getting<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.470> levels<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.010> enchant<00:01:11.369> their

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
getting good levels to enchant their

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
getting good levels to enchant their
weapons<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.000> Nora<00:01:12.240> right<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
weapons or Nora right and so kind of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
weapons or Nora right and so kind of
it's<00:01:13.680> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> cycle<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> goodness<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's kind of a cycle of of goodness and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
it's kind of a cycle of of goodness and
at<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> same<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.310> could<00:01:17.460> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
at the same time you know you could have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.830 
at the same time you know you could have
teammate<00:01:17.880> mining<00:01:18.150> gold<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
teammate mining gold to make you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
teammate mining gold to make you
strength<00:01:19.140> pots<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:19.860> someone<00:01:20.070> comes

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
strength pots so that when someone comes

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760 
strength pots so that when someone comes
in<00:01:20.460> taxed<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> hit<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.049> or

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
in taxed you know you can to hit them or

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.320 
in taxed you know you can to hit them or
maybe<00:01:22.950> golden<00:01:23.310> apples<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.729> resistance<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
maybe golden apples for resistance I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.820 
maybe golden apples for resistance I
mean<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.930> only<00:01:24.960> counter<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.619> people

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
mean really your only counter for people

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
mean really your only counter for people
coming<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.280> strength<00:01:26.520> watson's<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> have

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
coming in with strength watson's to have

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
coming in with strength watson's to have
that<00:01:27.330> resistance<00:01:27.689> from<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.990> golden<00:01:28.259> apple

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that resistance from your golden apple

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
that resistance from your golden apple
so<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.579> really<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.000> benefits<00:01:30.299> your

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so it really it really benefits your

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
so it really it really benefits your
team<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.350> hang<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> Nexus<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.280> you're
