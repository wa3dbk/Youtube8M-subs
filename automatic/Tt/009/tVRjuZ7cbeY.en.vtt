00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.329
 well let's now do an analysis 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.300
 frame by frame and let's see 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:48.070
 as from this area approximately 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.170
 the unidentified figure comes out that we're going 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.350
 to be able to appreciate comes out with a lot 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 speed and more or less has this 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.430
 flight perspective so I'm going to go 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.500
 little by little and here we see how it appears 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.159
 For the first time it is clear that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.310
 is behind the mountain advanced another 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.100
 frame and the frame is so fast 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.039
 that they do not practically show 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.289
 movements however when it happens here 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.869
 we can appreciate the one that 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.580
 evolved in his flight another frame 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.000
 plus 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.140
 another one and it is already very close to the sun 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 we can see how on this side there are 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.770
 the lighting of the sun and also he 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 has this area here as with certain 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.549
 illumination 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.280
 I get closer and in the next frame 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.650
 we see how the sun is already going through and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.810
 is about to disappear when 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.040
 advanced the next frame 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.060
 it is not there if I pushed it back I see it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 it is no longer there, it is no longer there, it is no longer 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.520
 it is if we had it fast 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.689
 again 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.150
 too fleeting 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 let's take a little more back 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.110
 here 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.110
 d 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.510
 too fast and what is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.360
 to do anything for example a 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.950
 bird apart that perspective gives 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.230
 a big size because it shows 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.140
 clearly that is behind the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.390
 cable car apart from that the speed is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.720
 an extraordinary thing 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.260
 too quickly 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.260
 uff 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.769
 good since it happened 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.769
 too 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.970
 good 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.970
 I leave you there
