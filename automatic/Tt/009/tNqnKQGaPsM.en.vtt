00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
that I liked it so much I thought I'd

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.400 
that I liked it so much I thought I'd
make<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> small<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.140> I'd<00:00:22.230> make<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
make a small that thought I'd make a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.019 
make a small that thought I'd make a
large<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> fewer

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
large you know as you know the fewer

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.689 
large you know as you know the fewer
seams<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.720> better<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.710> decided<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> go<00:00:26.519> all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
seams the better so I decided to go all

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.460 
seams the better so I decided to go all
out<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.630> goes<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.439> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
out this one goes all the way up here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.220 
out this one goes all the way up here
the<00:00:28.740> front<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.090> top<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.810> when<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> get

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the front over the top and when you get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.010 
the front over the top and when you get
here<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> side<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.940> wraps<00:00:33.270> around<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
here to the side it wraps around the
seal<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> same<00:00:34.920> piece<00:00:35.130> wraps<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
seal the same piece wraps around to the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.600 
seal the same piece wraps around to the
edge<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> keeps<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.129> going

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
edge here but then it keeps on going
