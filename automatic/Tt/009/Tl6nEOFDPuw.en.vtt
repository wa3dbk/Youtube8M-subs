00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.269
 hello with you sergey city ​​omsk we 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 continue our video and it is dedicated 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.759
 review so let's say construction of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.740
 metal 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.789
 I was interested in this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 structures this mount 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.730
 directly racks which in concrete 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.900
 flooded pigs 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 mounted on the heel but such imbedded and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 accordingly, there is an adjustment according to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.270
 height 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.649
 and it is very essential order 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.030
 20 25 millimeters 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.030
 they keep on the nuts 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.600
 I saw the same mount when 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.640
 manufacturing 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.879
 overground crossings in the city in our 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.470
 the city that they do exactly the same 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.380
 pigs poured into them studs immediately and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.860
 then the installation takes place directly 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.860
 worth 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.040
 then most likely it will be sheathed 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.040
 sandwich here we have a nodal connection 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 beams 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.689
 here comes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.509
 still curious question of course me 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.240
 What happens here? 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.420
 pairing two 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.540
 hangars healthy they slope roof goes 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.189
 just here in the middle 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.369
 that way they collect 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:03.299
 liquids and snow and snow load 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:08.119
 very curious this here is farm beams and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.119
 farm can be called 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.310
 then most likely a sandwich 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.969
 all metal head 6 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.969
 meter will turn warmed hangar 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.770
 of course 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.680
 affects a large number 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.220
 iron structures and volumes with 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220
 construction 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 through drawing 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.370
 firm entry it all hangs here on 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.370
 During a small piece of iron 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.870
 that on the one hand 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.870
 what's the other side 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.690
 Well rides technicians need to be curtailed 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.320
 we all were Sergei 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.320
 goodbye
