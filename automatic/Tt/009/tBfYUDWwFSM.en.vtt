00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that and that's why they're really

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
that and that's why they're really
promoting<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> Batmobile<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.680> we've

promoting the Batmobile because we've

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.619

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
like like I said in like the subway the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.999 
like like I said in like the subway the
old<00:02:06.149> subway<00:02:06.390> stations<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.649> could<00:02:07.829> have

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
old subway stations or you could have

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
old subway stations or you could have
one<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.489> maybe<00:02:08.910> under<00:02:09.479> wonder<00:02:09.929> tower

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

something<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> would<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.459> really

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
something like that it would be really

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.710 
something like that it would be really
cool<00:02:11.730> if

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
cool if

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.380 
cool if
they<00:02:12.870> added<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> batcave<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:15.120> some

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
they added in the batcave it to some

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.790 
they added in the batcave it to some
degree<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.500> said<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
degree you know it like I said it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.780 
degree you know it like I said it
doesn't<00:02:16.830> necessarily<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.640> under

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
doesn't necessarily have to be under

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
doesn't necessarily have to be under
Wayne<00:02:18.060> Manor<00:02:18.240> but<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.020> would<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.380> cool

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
Wayne Manor but it would be really cool

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
Wayne Manor but it would be really cool
if<00:02:19.710> they<00:02:20.040> added<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> Batcave<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> feel

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
if they added in the Batcave and I feel

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.820 
if they added in the Batcave and I feel
that<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.990> make<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> game<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
that that would just make the game that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.230 
that that would just make the game that
much<00:02:23.040> better<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.850> do<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> guys<00:02:24.180> think

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240
