00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.990
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.510
 let's see how to make a hard reset a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 reset to lg optimus that also 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.690
 known as the shaft in 975 remember that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.670
 these methods delete all data from the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.099
 device it would be convenient to make a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 backup and we will make it 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.669
 through two methods in case you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.349
 we can access the menu and if 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.980
 we can not through a combination 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.349
 of keys first let's check what 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.079
 version has the device we enter 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.079
 within the menu in settings 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.730
 about the phone we enter 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.980
 phone identity 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.829
 and we check that it's a lg and 975 we're going to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.360
 go back to check to see what 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 software version has android 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.770
 we check that you have version 4.1 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 Point 2 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.350
 we go back again to adjustments 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.670
 we went into backup of 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.470
 reset restore factory data 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.590
 reset phone and finally erase 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.660
 everything we accept and we wait for it 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.470
 restart when it finishes when 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.420
 turn on would already be reset in case of 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.510
 that we can not access the menu 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.910
 the device and we have to press the 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.890
 time the power keys and lower the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.470
 volume until it appears on the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.470
 screen the reset menu in English 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 once it appears we have to press 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.930
 the power key to confirm or 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.780
 any other key to cancel 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.960
 then we press again power to 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.960
 confirm and any other key to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 cancel 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.299
 We wait for it to turn on and it would be 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.340
 reset and this is all we hope that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.170
