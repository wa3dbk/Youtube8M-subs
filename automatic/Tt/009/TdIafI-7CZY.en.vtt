it<00:00:27.900> would<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.820> little<00:00:29.820> design<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it would be like a little design just to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.500 
it would be like a little design just to
keep<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.740> bright<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.250> night<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.000> kind<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
keep it bright at night and it kind of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.490 
keep it bright at night and it kind of
looked<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:33.930> um<00:00:35.660> if<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> goes<00:00:37.020> dark<00:00:37.320> you'll

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
looked good um if it goes dark you'll

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
looked good um if it goes dark you'll
see<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:39.050> there's<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.260> one<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.670> way

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.410 
see that there's only one way in one way
out<00:00:42.230> besides<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.710> fly<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.879> doing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
out besides if you fly like I'm doing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.470 
out besides if you fly like I'm doing
right<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> there's<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.230> door<00:00:50.480> I'm

pretty sure I should do some changes on
it<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.629> many<00:00:54.840> details<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> outside
