00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.200
 of this channel 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 today we have to talk about the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760
 most relevant news of yesterday 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.779
 so let's start and it's no more 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.990
 not less than the galaxy s 5 yesterday 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 samsung confirmed the date on which it goes 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 to be the presentation of this new 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 device was going to be on February 24 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.760
 the day of the flag here in mexico well 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 is that we hope there are no classes for 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 can see the transmission via internet the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.320
 presentation of this device is going to 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.510
 carried out during the Mobile World 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 congress that will be held in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 barcelona during that week in that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.539
 samsung event is going to be your own event 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.270
 where will you present different 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.149
 devices I suppose and among them the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 the most important will be the galaxy s 5 ha 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.280
 there have been many many lately 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.979
 rumors regarding what will bring 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.690
 the galaxy s 5 and some of its 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.330
 filter specifications 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.370
 or rumored they are going to bring three 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.010
 gigabytes of ram memory such as 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.500
 galaxy note 3 and there is talk that in the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.690
 screen is what you're going to do like that 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 the most remarkable thing in this device 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.550
 because it would be a resolution 2 here I 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
 I know that for many this is a 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.230
 exaggeration and they say that it is not necessary 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.360
 but it seems that samsung is not interested 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.280
 much that those types of users say and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 will bet to put a tremendous 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
 resolution in these new devices 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.370
 it is also said that he will bring the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 most recent processors both 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.770
 snapdragon like successes and just like in the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
 s 4 will depend so is the version 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 international or the other version does not 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 like to talk about rumors too much but 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.630
 I'm going to tell you one last one tells you that 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.210
 will come in two versions one metal 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.150
 and other plastic people who read 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.700
 this rumor and then later they compare it 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.850
 with what apple did with the iPhone 5 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 that and 5 c and obviously they start another 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 time to criticize samsung for copying and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.240
 for many more things what has been 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.700
 pretty filtered are catches of the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.710
 applications that will bring the galaxy s 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 5 and in 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.710
 the catches you can appreciate that in the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.140
 design are being adapted to what 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.660
 it's android 4.4 kitkat since lately 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.940
 the relationship between samsung and google has 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.570
 been a little more friendly and have been 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.430
 chatting so that samsung does not make a 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.410
 interface very very very different from that of 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.640
 Android so hopefully the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.780
 next galaxy s 5 do not come so so so 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.880
 customized by samsung but yes 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.160
 bring applications that make it be 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 different from the rest of the others and so 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.540
 we came to the question of the video a lot 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180
 people especially on the internet are 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.100
 dedicate to say that samsung no longer innovates 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.230
 that is only more of the same as 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.330
 just want to put more screen and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.550
 that has already lost like that attractiveness 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.950
 innovator who had the question that you 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 I do is what do you think they can innovate 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 both samsung and the other brands in 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.070
 about smartphones the screens 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.810
 curves it seems that they are not going to be a 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.720
 trend because it is already very difficult 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.310
 innovate on a smartphone and now only 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.160
 it would be to improve it but if you imagine 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 something that can be innovated in a 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.519
 smartphone put it in the comments 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 let's try to be respectful in the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.690
 comments that some haters 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.390
 samsung and others love samsung so is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.379
 let's try to put comments 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 respectful personally I am 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.750
 excited to see what news will bring 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.480
 the galaxy s 5 since I am very happy with 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.459
 my galaxy s 4 although I know I recognize that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.489
 It has a lot of mistakes but also 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.170
 they like their virtues very much, so 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.720
 the comments also why 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.390
 innovations in software could 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.010
 suppose in a new device because 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.860
 in this market it is already very difficult 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.900
 innovate in terms of hardware so it's that 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.940
 it looks then later that samsung is 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.129
 trying to innovate in terms of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.799
 software sometimes in an attempt too 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.450
 desperate saturates applications but 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.549
 if you could innovate in terms of 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.560
 software that is what you would do that 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.239
 also put it in the comments and that 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.430
 it's been all for this video I hope that 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.680
 you liked it and remember the date of 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.289
 presentation of the galaxy s 5 will be 24 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.049
 February to one p.m. time 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.479
 from Mexico at 8 o'clock at night time 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.210
 Spain 'and let's hope it's a good 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.220
 device for the sake of android 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.220
 in the market see you next
