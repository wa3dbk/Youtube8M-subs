three of these little things and I
thought<00:00:20.300> it<00:00:20.420> would<00:00:20.480> be<00:00:20.570> fun<00:00:20.779> to<00:00:20.930> open<00:00:21.050> them<00:00:21.260> up

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
but before we open them let's learn a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.140 
but before we open them let's learn a
little<00:00:24.470> bit<00:00:24.740> more<00:00:24.890> about<00:00:25.070> them<00:00:25.310> no<00:00:25.700> one<00:00:25.880> seems

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
little bit more about them no one seems

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.790 
little bit more about them no one seems
to<00:00:26.240> know<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.570> actual<00:00:26.990> name<00:00:27.320> of<00:00:27.530> this<00:00:27.650> little

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
to know the actual name of this little

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.980 
to know the actual name of this little
Bondi<00:00:28.280> series<00:00:28.700> so<00:00:29.120> they<00:00:29.240> are<00:00:29.360> often<00:00:29.510> just

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
Bondi series so they are often just

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.900 
Bondi series so they are often just
called<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.620> ramen<00:00:31.010> figures<00:00:31.340> because<00:00:31.760> their

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
called the ramen figures because their

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.210 
called the ramen figures because their
packaging<00:00:32.480> looks<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.290> much<00:00:33.470> like<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.800> pack<00:00:34.070> of

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
packaging looks so much like a pack of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.250 
packaging looks so much like a pack of
ramen<00:00:34.370> as<00:00:34.699> far<00:00:35.180> as<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:35.480> know<00:00:35.540> there<00:00:35.930> are<00:00:36.020> eight

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
little guys up since he's on top I think

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.750 
little guys up since he's on top I think
we<00:01:08.990> will<00:01:09.110> start<00:01:09.409> with<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.740> Crillon<00:01:10.280> packet

now<00:01:11.450> just<00:01:11.750> feeling<00:01:12.380> around<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.009> packet<00:01:13.549> I

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.219 
now just feeling around on this packet I
do<00:01:14.530> think<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:15.979> some<00:01:16.520> sort<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.229> model

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
do think that we have some sort of model

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.130 
do think that we have some sort of model
kits<00:01:18.619> type<00:01:19.119> situation<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:20.329> I'm<00:01:20.539> not<00:01:20.750> sure<00:01:20.990> if

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
kits type situation but I'm not sure if

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.950 
kits type situation but I'm not sure if
I'm<00:01:21.289> correct<00:01:21.560> very<00:01:22.250> nice<00:01:22.610> cute<00:01:23.149> simple<00:01:23.570> but

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'm correct very nice cute simple but

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.990 
I'm correct very nice cute simple but
but<00:01:24.229> very<00:01:24.380> striking<00:01:25.130> packaging<00:01:25.729> on<00:01:25.850> these

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
but very striking packaging on these

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.370 
but very striking packaging on these
things<00:01:26.329> I<00:01:26.570> really<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.079> Crillon

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
things I really like the Crillon

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.139 
things I really like the Crillon
packaging<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:27.920> lot<00:01:28.310> I'm<00:01:28.549> gonna<00:01:28.700> be<00:01:28.820> quite

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
packaging a lot I'm gonna be quite

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.349 
packaging a lot I'm gonna be quite
careful<00:01:29.539> when<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:29.960> open<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.350> not<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.590> destroy<00:01:31.159> it

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
careful when I open it not to destroy it

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.069 
careful when I open it not to destroy it
unfortunately<00:01:32.359> there's<00:01:32.600> nothing<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
unfortunately there's nothing on the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
back of the package that I can read and

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.609 
back of the package that I can read and
I<00:01:35.539> did<00:01:35.659> want<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.840> mention<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.170> I<00:01:36.229> don't<00:01:36.469> know

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.979 
thought certainly if it's a model kit
then<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.430> must<00:02:46.580> only<00:02:46.700> be<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.840> them

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
then there must only be one of them

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.720 
then there must only be one of them
inside<00:02:48.319> of<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.830> get<00:02:48.950> three<00:02:49.400> little

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
inside of there but to get three little

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.270
