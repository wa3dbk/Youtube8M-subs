00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
year what else do we have at the 400 so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.939 
year what else do we have at the 400 so
first<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.760> all<00:00:58.879> it's<00:00:59.449> a<00:00:59.570> triple<00:01:00.080> CMOS<00:01:00.530> sensor

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
first of all it's a triple CMOS sensor

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
camera with a 2/3 inch layout so that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.429 
camera with a 2/3 inch layout so that
means<00:01:04.430> we<00:01:04.640> have<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.390> know<00:01:05.420> from<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.900> pmw

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
means we have as you know from the pmw

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.429 
means we have as you know from the pmw
350<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.220> great<00:01:07.790> sensitivity<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:09.110> have<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
350 the great sensitivity we have the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.890 
350 the great sensitivity we have the
really<00:01:10.130> great<00:01:10.340> signal-to-noise<00:01:10.850> ratio<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.510> CC

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.830 
really great signal-to-noise ratio of CC
DP<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.439> it's<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.189> first<00:01:13.490> camera<00:01:13.789> which<00:01:14.600> is

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
DP and it's a first camera which is

dealing<00:01:15.380> with<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> flashbang<00:01:16.369> compensation

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
dealing with a flashbang compensation

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.969 
dealing with a flashbang compensation
because<00:01:17.479> we<00:01:17.600> are<00:01:17.659> using<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.109> CMOS<00:01:18.619> sensor

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
because we are using a CMOS sensor

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.099 
because we are using a CMOS sensor

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
compensate the flash bands which can

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.389 
compensate the flash bands which can

portfolio which is with OPM that with
500<00:01:32.179> for<00:01:32.329> example<00:01:32.659> pmw<00:01:33.140> 200<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.579> really

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
500 for example pmw 200 so it's really

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.819 
500 for example pmw 200 so it's really
easy<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.210> use<00:01:35.359> and<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:36.289> get<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.530> best<00:01:36.710> quality

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
easy to use and you get the best quality

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.800 
easy to use and you get the best quality
from<00:01:37.249> sony<00:01:37.520> as<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.729> ever<00:01:37.909> expect<00:01:38.359> and<00:01:38.689> what

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
from sony as you ever expect and what

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.700 
from sony as you ever expect and what
else<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.200> have

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
else we have

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.469 
else we have
so<00:01:40.039> it's<00:01:40.189> a<00:01:40.280> successor<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.880> 350<00:01:41.390> as

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
so it's a successor of the 350 as

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.330 
so it's a successor of the 350 as
