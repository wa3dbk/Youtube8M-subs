00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.800
 Welcome to the doctor channel. 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.670
 in computing and today in our video 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.160
 class 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.470
 will be a complementary video to our 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.289
 videos that we have here on the channel that 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.050
 are the videos that teach how to 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.509
 installation of operating systems 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.620
 so several people were with 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.969
 doubts about a boot, right? 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.090
 able to install the system 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.780
 then this class will be dedicated to 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.410
 make the modification a bios setup and 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.270
 sets the bios to the primary boot 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.170
 be the cd rom 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.600
 so let's show some examples here 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.090
 as you may be seeing on the screen are 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.850
 Barbarians start at the first screen of the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.829
 beaux known as post where it shows 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.460
 below that which is highlighted in 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:10.600
 red in the photo efe two prince 2 of the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.720
 setap but usually the most 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.970
 common to enter the bios setup is the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 key of a key and the f2 f10 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.300
 I brought here two bills of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.180

 I'll show both models here. 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.830
 because sometimes it may happen that 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.680
