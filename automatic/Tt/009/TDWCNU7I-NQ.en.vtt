00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
built which was very important for us in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.869 
built which was very important for us in
the<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> beginning<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the first time in the beginning so a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
the first time in the beginning so a
very<00:01:00.390> important<00:01:01.079> thing<00:01:01.500> from<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> motorcycle

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
very important thing from the motorcycle

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
very important thing from the motorcycle
structure<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.229> architecture<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
structure is to have the architecture of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.670 
structure is to have the architecture of
the<00:01:05.489> motorcycle<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:07.049> made<00:01:07.320> for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the motorcycle really made for

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520 
the motorcycle really made for
customizing<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.479> wanted<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> people

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
customizing we really wanted to people

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
customizing we really wanted to people
to<00:01:10.770> find<00:01:11.369> their<00:01:11.700> own<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.720> their

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to find their own way and their

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.130 
to find their own way and their
individualization<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.420> idea<00:01:15.810> also

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
individualization that was the idea also

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
individualization that was the idea also
in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> beginning<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.119> follow

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in the beginning and we really follow

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
in the beginning and we really follow
this<00:01:18.630> idea<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.400> was<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> reason<00:01:20.790> also

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this idea and that was the reason also

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.950 
this idea and that was the reason also
to<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.560> frame<00:01:23.119> made<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> four

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to have like the frame made out of four

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.450 
to have like the frame made out of four
different<00:01:25.560> parts<00:01:25.939> what<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.540> is

different parts what you can see here is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
different parts what you can see here is
the<00:01:29.460> remaining<00:01:30.270> part<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.439> lost<00:01:32.250> of

the remaining part if you get lost of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
the remaining part if you get lost of
all<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> others<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.930> part<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> lying

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
all the others like one part is lying

all the others like one part is lying
here<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> desk

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
here on the desk

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.899 
here on the desk
the<00:01:36.450> other<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:38.750> see<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> can

for everyone's customizing we have

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
for everyone's customizing we have
really<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.659> connections

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
really we have through connections

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.540 
really we have through connections
between<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
between the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.810 
between the
on<00:01:59.850> both<00:02:00.360> Direction<00:02:01.200> also<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.280> underneath

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
on both Direction also on the underneath

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.460 
on both Direction also on the underneath
and<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.420> top<00:02:03.630> sector<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.050> don't<00:02:04.230> have<00:02:04.380> to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
and the top sector you don't have to

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.920 
and the top sector you don't have to
flex<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> off<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.120> can<00:02:06.390> build<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
flex it off you can and you can build it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.560 
flex it off you can and you can build it
back<00:02:07.320> very<00:02:07.890> easy<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.150> can<00:02:09.479> only

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
back very easy and then you can only

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.690 
back very easy and then you can only
have<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:10.050> different<00:02:10.680> styles<00:02:11.100> without

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
have really different styles without

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.090 
have really different styles without
destroying<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.840> motorcycle<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.920> always
