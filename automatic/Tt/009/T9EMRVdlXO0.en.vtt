 Lyon is jostled and struggling to get out 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.440
 pressing imposed by the hubert team 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.450
 supply Lombard is alerted in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 depth and is facing rémy 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.530
 Lombard vercoutre loses his duel to the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 keeper Lyon who has well plugged his 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 angle and shows up again 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.470
 decisive in front of his counterparts at gaza 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.760

 harmless and it's half an hour 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.060
 Caen's defense game that goes from 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.330

 the volley of gaetan courtet is repulsed 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.710
 by rémy vercoutre who preserves his cage 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 inviolate 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.340
 0 0 at the half time and in view of the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 domination of reims is almost a small 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.850
 miracle to see Lyon return to
