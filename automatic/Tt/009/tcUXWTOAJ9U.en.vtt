the<00:02:23.680> way<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.340> came<00:02:24.580> after<00:02:25.240> assembling<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.220> from

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the way it came after assembling it from

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
the way it came after assembling it from
the<00:02:27.310> box<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.900> only<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.320> that<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.470> did<00:02:29.770> do<00:02:29.980> is

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
the box the only thing that I did do is

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.370 
the box the only thing that I did do is
I<00:02:31.740> calibrated<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.090> IMU<00:02:34.090> as<00:02:34.510> per<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:37.090> know

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
I calibrated the IMU as per you know

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.370 
I calibrated the IMU as per you know
manufacturer<00:02:38.380> suggestions<00:02:39.960> but<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.080> props

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
manufacturer suggestions but the props

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.780 
manufacturer suggestions but the props
are<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.950> same<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:44.220> done<00:02:45.220> nothing<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
are the same the done nothing to the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.400 
are the same the done nothing to the
into<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.360> rotors<00:02:48.840> nothing<00:02:49.840> basically<00:02:50.200> it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
into the rotors nothing basically it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.570 
into the rotors nothing basically it's
all<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.770> same<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.100> haven't<00:02:51.340> made<00:02:51.430> any

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
all the same I haven't made any

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.220 
all the same I haven't made any
modifications<00:02:52.330> i<00:02:52.710> mounted<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.980> GoPro<00:02:54.520> on

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
modifications i mounted the GoPro on

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.840 
modifications i mounted the GoPro on
because<00:02:56.230> they're<00:02:56.680> they're<00:02:57.190> mounting<00:02:57.640> plate

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
because they're they're mounting plate

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.490 
because they're they're mounting plate
isn't<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.390> good<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.080> comes<00:02:59.260> with

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
isn't that good the one that comes with

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380 
isn't that good the one that comes with
it<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.710> not<00:02:59.890> not<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.850> not<00:03:01.180> impressed

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
it it's not not that I'm not impressed

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.920 
it it's not not that I'm not impressed
right<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.470> i<00:03:02.500> used<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.540> underwater

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
right so i used the the underwater

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
right so i used the the underwater
housing<00:03:05.350> basically<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.130> mounted<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
housing basically just mounted it and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.460 
housing basically just mounted it and
that's<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:08.020> you're<00:03:08.170> looking<00:03:08.200> at

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
that's that's what you're looking at

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.750 
that's that's what you're looking at
right<00:03:08.530> now

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.809 

I<00:03:10.849> didn't<00:03:11.599> do<00:03:12.290> anything<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:13.159> stop<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.580> jello

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
I didn't do anything to stop the jello

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.309 
I didn't do anything to stop the jello
effect<00:03:14.030> which<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.629> one<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.019> things<00:03:15.170> that

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
effect which is one of the things that

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.500 
effect which is one of the things that
I'm<00:03:15.500> really<00:03:15.739> worried<00:03:16.250> about<00:03:16.310> reading<00:03:17.269> through

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
I'm really worried about reading through

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.750 
I'm really worried about reading through
some<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.810> reviews<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.920> quadcopter

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.240 

like<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.659> said<00:03:22.720> I've<00:03:23.319> done<00:03:23.560> absolutely<00:03:23.830> nothing

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
like I said I've done absolutely nothing

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.890 
like I said I've done absolutely nothing
and<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.049> essentially<00:03:26.650> my<00:03:26.890> first<00:03:27.159> video<00:03:27.900> I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
and this is essentially my first video I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.160 
and this is essentially my first video I
got<00:03:29.439> about<00:03:29.769> eight<00:03:30.489> minutes<00:03:30.939> of<00:03:31.299> video<00:03:31.750> a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
got about eight minutes of video a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.660 
got about eight minutes of video a
little<00:03:32.319> over<00:03:32.709> eight<00:03:32.799> minutes<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.220> video<00:03:33.370> but

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
little over eight minutes of video but

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.979 
little over eight minutes of video but
it<00:03:33.760> turns<00:03:33.939> out<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.180> i<00:03:34.420> actually<00:03:34.569> started

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
it turns out that i actually started

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.140 
it turns out that i actually started
flying<00:03:35.379> it<00:03:35.709> before<00:03:36.159> i<00:03:36.189> realized<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.939> i<00:03:37.060> had

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
flying it before i realized that i had

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.960 
flying it before i realized that i had
turned<00:03:37.599> on<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.409> camera<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.489> i<00:03:39.519> flew<00:03:39.790> it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
turned on the camera so i flew it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.360 
turned on the camera so i flew it
probably<00:03:40.360> for<00:03:40.540> about<00:03:40.650> three<00:03:41.650> minutes<00:03:41.829> before

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
probably for about three minutes before

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.130 
probably for about three minutes before
i<00:03:42.400> remembered<00:03:43.180> home<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:43.720> didn't<00:03:43.930> turn<00:03:44.049> on

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
i remembered home and I didn't turn on

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.350 
i remembered home and I didn't turn on
the<00:03:44.260> camera<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> landed<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.790> again<00:03:46.000> turn<00:03:46.239> on

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
the camera so I landed it again turn on

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.149 
the camera so I landed it again turn on
the<00:03:46.450> camera<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.930> then<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.379> is<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.829> is<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
the camera and then this is this is the

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.599 
the camera and then this is this is the
flight<00:03:52.379> I'm<00:03:53.379> gonna<00:03:53.530> put<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:54.040> link<00:03:54.400> at<00:03:54.579> the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
flight I'm gonna put a link at the

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.839 
flight I'm gonna put a link at the
bottom<00:03:54.700> of<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.209> description<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:56.079> the

bottom of the description to the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.369 
bottom of the description to the
manufacturer's<00:03:57.849> videos<00:03:58.329> which<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.840> did<00:03:59.109> watch

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
manufacturer's videos which I did watch

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.949 
manufacturer's videos which I did watch
several<00:04:00.099> times<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.849> why<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.659> fly<00:04:01.900> this

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
several times of why I think to fly this

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.890 
several times of why I think to fly this
thing<00:04:02.200> for<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.680> first<00:04:02.920> time<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.510> strongly

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
thing for the first time and I strongly

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.599 
thing for the first time and I strongly
recommend<00:04:05.019> anybody<00:04:05.590> thinking<00:04:06.159> about<00:04:06.370> buying

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
recommend anybody thinking about buying

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
this thing to do the same thing go

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.270 
this thing to do the same thing go
through<00:04:09.670> their<00:04:09.819> videos<00:04:10.470> very<00:04:11.470> informative<00:04:12.010> I

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
through their videos very informative I

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.830 
through their videos very informative I
mean<00:04:12.459> basically<00:04:12.760> they<00:04:13.180> explain<00:04:13.569> everything

you need to know to get this thing

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.610 
you need to know to get this thing
flying<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.930> there's<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.229> whole<00:04:17.380> lot

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
flying not that there's a whole lot

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.449 
flying not that there's a whole lot
because<00:04:18.100> they're<00:04:18.310> really<00:04:18.699> really<00:04:18.850> isn't<00:04:19.269> I

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
because they're really really isn't I

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.250 
because they're really really isn't I
tested<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.519> lot<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.210> features<00:04:22.419> i've<00:04:22.810> tested

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
tested a lot of the features i've tested

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.620 
tested a lot of the features i've tested
the<00:04:23.500> goal<00:04:23.680> look<00:04:24.330> come<00:04:25.330> home

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.290 

the<00:04:28.050> home<00:04:28.290> lock<00:04:28.560> not<00:04:29.520> not<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
the home lock not not the not the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.600 
the home lock not not the not the
failsafe<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:31.020> didn't<00:04:31.290> have<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> guts<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.460> do

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
failsafe I didn't have the guts to do

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.420 
failsafe I didn't have the guts to do
that<00:04:32.640> yet<00:04:33.000> maybe<00:04:33.510> I'll<00:04:33.690> do<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.840> in<00:04:34.140> future
