00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.030
 Well then it's an original announcement 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:20.160
 Continue true whether attract customers marketing After doing can be well in the last time the number of people 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:24.960
 There is a different pattern but I talked about a typical example 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.850
 Before and after state of the person who actually produced the result 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.360
 How is it from that one eye 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.960
 It's clear from what's going to be from the state and which word gets stuck 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.550
 And 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 Really minister at that time 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.000
 In the case of a sole proprietor something something that is not it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.430
 Day 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.060
 It is to clarify the present 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.000
 There was a marketing god Masanori Kanda 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 It is caught as a mark work at all that is applicable to everyone 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.239
 Well, for example, wages business day 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.070
 I want to live Rashiku yourself to find what you want to do yourself 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:12.610
 Please as it is seen as a 's own home 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 Mr. Masanori Kanda was there at Shibuya scramble intersection, and I would like to say that negative time when my own 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.100
 It is said that it is a thing and it turns around and it is a good day boy 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:26.060
 Attached to that I want to Rashiku alive yourself scramble intersection is also the case for example Sukurashi 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.720
 Even if you say that you want , I think that everyone is about yourself 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.720
 But good 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.090
 For example, in the forties in a bee city ​​a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 Woman owner day son two days 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.560
 And then the sound will be 3000 in the sciences, but the boy who will be the three of the sciences 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.850
 I'm wondering which direction I should work in 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.890
 Women in their 40s managers d is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.700
 Erotic 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.159
 To see the 40's female managers repeat cross 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.920
 There are three children , but if you buy a son , it may be a bit empty 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.840
 There is also a daughter a 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:12.849
 There are about 3 children , but if you say that there was a child with a malformed child, just saying that there was a child 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.620
 Suffering in the terrible job hunting I'm not a man of the pie in its Once you only daughter 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.520
 Might possibly dad might come with the pin If you do Do not have a daughter 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.940
 Suffering job hunting but retaining clips Even if you're of managers 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.790
 Oh yes g 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.830
 If it's a minute it's a pin 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.680
 In other words 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.060
 It's okay if you don't pay it 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 Oh my guidance is high enough to say that I'm talking about myself 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 However, many people Well I want to provide this service to a lot of people 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 I will do it for everyone 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 Where 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.640
 Direction is also no one in it Ya's properly m 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.010
 And when I squeeze the milk I like myself that it is the yellow leek taste 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.750
 諡 8 ground rights 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.640
 For example my father 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.510
 Or mother is a manager and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.840
 Kodama day 2 and then 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.650
 At that time, I think that there was a very good idea for job hunting of my son and I was able to solve it 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.790
 Then the field is 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:25.379
 It is the field where there is knowledge experience and a seat 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:30.239
 That other to easy is actually niche and the first throttle of Tteyuu where he was Rikui of Ki-tae Te Hay 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:37.780
 Overwhelming superiority difference comes out than anyone's competition 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:41.700
 That is, towards the people of the stage before his Rikui was've been a place of their own is experiencing decreases 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.440
 When we squeeze as day and send 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.069
 I think it's about myself- this person has come through 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:57.210
 It is a brush that seems to be a person 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:04:01.950
 And if you say only the squeeze way comes down to people who have nothing to do with it 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:08.730
 For example, nobody came that please come people want to fulfill their Gasa to find what you want at the supermarket 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.980
 I want to find something I want to do in science but I want to tell the child in the batsuichi at the female owner but not 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.520
 There is a person consultation 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.200
 When I said that I am father but I try to find it 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.269
 It's a cultural system but I'm interested 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:27.090
 For'm not I'm Te' There are managers of the children when old 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:31.580
 You get stuck somewhere to get in touch and the stars you provide that service 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.129
 Why is it mean Tsu'm If you can, of course okay 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:41.240
 What's important about obsessed marketing 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:44.780
 And at that time squeezing the very gap niche in Megyaku 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.550
 Because there is a need because it is generally popular 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:55.210
 It closed not, for example, generally small and medium-sized business owners in 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.480
 I reasonably free to use also Te Mote money want to support the layer Well then from bears Tteru 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.810
 not 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:09.010
 There is no competition if you focus your house on where you have experienced and overcame 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.240
 Branch the house as if to find a place where there is no conflict 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.240
 Where is the point 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.360
 I want to Zehiya'
