the standard color and at that point we

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.320 
the standard color and at that point we
can<00:03:01.720> read<00:03:02.049> off<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.799> exact<00:03:03.310> level<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.850> ID<00:03:04.090> and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
that the color in this standard vial has

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020 
that the color in this standard vial has
reached<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.380> color<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> card<00:03:12.340> which

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
reached the color on the card which

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.670 
reached the color on the card which
means<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> reaction<00:03:14.260> has<00:03:14.290> now

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
means that the reaction has now

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.130 
means that the reaction has now
completed<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.970> when<00:03:16.150> we<00:03:16.269> look<00:03:16.450> into<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.900> test

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
completed and when we look into the test

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.880 
completed and when we look into the test
vial<00:03:17.530> we<00:03:18.070> see<00:03:18.340> when<00:03:18.549> we<00:03:18.670> look<00:03:18.700> around<00:03:19.060> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
vial we see when we look around the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670 
vial we see when we look around the
color<00:03:20.890> scale<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.730> see<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.680> closest

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
color scale we see that the closest

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.910 
color scale we see that the closest
matches<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.900> 0.03<00:03:25.900> which<00:03:26.380> means<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.829> we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
matches for 0.03 which means that we

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.710 
matches for 0.03 which means that we
have<00:03:27.600> 0.03<00:03:28.600> ppm<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.620> iodine<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:31.030> our<00:03:31.299> water

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
have 0.03 ppm of iodine in our water

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.280 
have 0.03 ppm of iodine in our water
sample<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.850> end<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.959> iodine

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
sample that is the end of the iodine

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.530 
sample that is the end of the iodine
test
