00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.310
 my life 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 hello how about friends I'm cloud in this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.949
 chance let's start with the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.050
 tutorials about android we're going to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.300
 start with the most essential thing that is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 root access let's start with a little 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.239
 of information that is good root access 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.680
 is to have access which allows us to 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.030
 run some applications that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.950
 they require deeper access from 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.630
 phone hardware which good with 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.180
 root access we will be able to 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.490
 and have more control within the 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.650
 cell phone apps and install 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.210
 many many more things of others 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.920
 phone manufacturers what is the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.880
 main advantage is that thanks to this 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 we will be able to install roms 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.460
 custom android 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 which would be the most 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 updated from android are not 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.880
 Officials should be mentioned but in some 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 cases for example six cell phones 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.240
 obsolete and there are no updates anymore 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.590
 a very good option to update the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 telephone what would be the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.229
 disadvantages of this good because at 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 modify the cell phone is lost 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 logically the cell phone warranty and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.410
 there is a bric risk of shining the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 phone that explains the phone leave it 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.740
 unusable that he does not do anything but 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.030
 today is no longer a problem anymore 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.160
 that is since there are different 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 applications that can reverse this 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.479
 this process let's also have here 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 a list of all the cell phones of the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.259
 cell models that we can root 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 with this application that I am going to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.390
 mention with the method that I'm going to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.800
 mention go from htc el gis nokia 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.229
 samsung sony ericsson and many models 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.640
 I do not know the list, I'm going to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 leave in the description so they can 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.229
 See if your phone is compatible with 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 all this and well let's start that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.040
 we need to start with with the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.970
 cell phone routing the first thing that 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.620
 We need to do 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.080
 The first thing we need to do is 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.880
 work the controllers 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 the cell phone drivers and or 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 I have here the and with the mobile in my case 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.730
 it's a day 510 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.200
 but good we're going to have to download 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.580
 the drivers I 'm going to leave here 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 in in the description of the video equal them 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 I'll leave the link with drivers 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.810
 cellular and the a roth lock that is going to be 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.200
 the application that will serve us for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.920
 this router the cell phone once 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.410
 we have downloaded these is this 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.090
 binder 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.740
 we are going to decompress he is going to give us 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.110
 these two applications these two 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.750
 folders two applications the first 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.580
 I would have already told you the drivers in your case 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.350
 the one of the model that is can look for it in 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.470
 the manufacturer already know a sony ericsson 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.440
 samsung can search for more drivers 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.190
 current 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.290
 the newest and need a crazy root 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.870
 I have them both installed and in 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.340
 this case I will open a locro and the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.110
 only the only thing they have to do is 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.030
 already from the cell phone 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.400
 I'm going to put a little bit of the singer here 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.970
 to see if it looks good 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.970
 why is it 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.140
 let's see here is 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.310
 this would be the cell phone and we have to 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.780
 just let's go here to adjustments 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.780
 and we are going to put 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120
 there is 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.490
 adjustments and we're going to put you to applications 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.620
 applied administration 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.440
 that one in development and we're going to put it 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.740
 USB debugging nothing will 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.290
 apply this box the first 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.270
 debug usb we will give you accept 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.000
 and since it's going to say debugging 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.060
 debug device usb we 're going 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.640
 to go to the application 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.640
 of a lock groot I'm going to open it again 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.489
 a lock wood 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.530
 perfect since they are in the application 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.520
 you just going to give us here rootear 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.950
 the cell model is going to come out and it's going 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.060
 to install is going to do the root once 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.710
 that I do not do it 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.750
 because I have it installed and that's it 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.000
 Rooted is going to restart the cell phone and 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.560
 this application will appear 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.260
 let me show you from appearing this 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.430
 super user application and once 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.470
 have this application leads to be 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.510

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.070
 that your cell phone is rooted 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.240
 download this application called ruth 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.569
 checker from the actor 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.639
 and you can verify root access here 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.710
 and listed them permission user will 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.870
 give allow and you will say 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.350
 congratulations your device is already 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.090
 rooted 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.130
 and good friends with this we are going to be able to 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.330
 apply is to install the applications or 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.370
