00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
electric beat over here so we'll beat

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
electric beat over here so we'll beat
this<00:01:23.430> mixture

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
this mixture

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this well we'll scrape the sites with

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.230 
this well we'll scrape the sites with
the<00:01:30.990> help<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.469> spatula<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.609> this<00:01:32.969> we

the eggs one by one and we'll continue
beating<00:01:38.819> this<00:01:39.149> mixture<00:01:40.369> will<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.549> tipped

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.830 

stop<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> egg<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> well<00:01:48.090> combined<00:01:48.569> in<00:01:48.719> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
stop it the egg is well combined in the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
stop it the egg is well combined in the
mixture<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.649> we'll<00:01:49.829> break<00:01:50.130> another<00:01:50.610> egg<00:01:50.969> in

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
mixture so we'll break another egg in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.260 
mixture so we'll break another egg in
the<00:01:51.240> bowl<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.469> we<00:01:52.619> scrape<00:01:53.069> the<00:01:53.399> sides<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the bowl so here we scrape the sides and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.249 
the bowl so here we scrape the sides and
we'll<00:01:54.719> beat<00:01:54.929> this<00:01:55.200> mixture<00:01:55.530> again<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.539> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
we'll beat this mixture again so this is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.710 
we'll beat this mixture again so this is
also<00:02:01.709> well<00:02:01.979> combined<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> mixture<00:02:03.149> it's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
also well combined in the mixture it's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.800 
also well combined in the mixture it's
time<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.170> add<00:02:04.349> the<00:02:04.590> third<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> final<00:02:05.429> egg

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
time to add the third and the final egg

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.020 
time to add the third and the final egg
so<00:02:06.810> we'll<00:02:06.959> keep<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:08.069> side<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.789> we'll

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so we'll keep it on the side and we'll

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:19.490 
so we'll keep it on the side and we'll
add<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.899> final<00:02:10.530> egg<00:02:10.769> will<00:02:11.400> mix<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.060> again<00:02:18.500> so

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
add the final egg will mix this again so

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.770 
add the final egg will mix this again so
a<00:02:19.530> batter<00:02:19.799> is<00:02:20.069> now<00:02:20.220> ready<00:02:20.250> let's<00:02:21.209> keep<00:02:21.510> this

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
a batter is now ready let's keep this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.589 
a batter is now ready let's keep this

otherwise<00:02:52.709> what<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.100> happen<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.639> because<00:02:54.569> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
otherwise what will happen is because of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.960 
otherwise what will happen is because of
the<00:02:54.870> baking<00:02:55.230> powder<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.160> cake<00:02:56.760> and

the baking powder in the cake and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300 
the baking powder in the cake and
because<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.780> eggs<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.500> cake<00:02:58.739> will<00:02:58.980> aerate

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
because of the eggs the cake will aerate

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.849 
because of the eggs the cake will aerate
and<00:02:59.639> if<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.150> fill<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.540> mold<00:03:00.780> completely<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
and if you fill the mold completely the

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.250 
and if you fill the mold completely the
cake<00:03:02.099> batter<00:03:02.340> will<00:03:02.639> all<00:03:02.819> come<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.019> we<00:03:04.139> do

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
cake batter will all come out so we do

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
not want that so I think this batter is

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229 
not want that so I think this batter is
sufficient<00:03:07.139> for<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.530> size<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:08.040> mold<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.609> you

sufficient for this size of mold as you

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.650 
sufficient for this size of mold as you
can<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.720> we'll<00:03:10.410> even<00:03:10.680> though<00:03:10.829> sites<00:03:11.700> will<00:03:12.419> tap

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
