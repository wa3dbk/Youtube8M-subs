00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
no block function so the only way to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
hit so if you want to learn that it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050

well my recommended skills you can

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 
well my recommended skills you can
clearly<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.270> very

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
clearly see that these are very

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.810 
clearly see that these are very
offensive<00:02:49.200> based<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.430> only<00:02:50.550> pick

offensive based but if you can only pick

offensive based but if you can only pick
one<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:51.420> would<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> some<00:02:52.170> form<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.590> earplugs
