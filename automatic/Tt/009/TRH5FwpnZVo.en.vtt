00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 true 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.820

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.710
 I prepare it myself, I bring it from 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
 suddenly here to the channel to eat me is 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.630
 as a very nutritious lunch and I think that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 it 's worth it for you to do it your your 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.010
 husband to his children and put it on 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820

 exactly that I have a cap 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 hermetic so that they do not come out in the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.329
 backpack not because there is nothing left 18 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 Incredible school I pass it angrily 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.290
 with that system that we have now chicken 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.820
 I cooked the letter the day I bought them 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.590
 I have commented that to me the chicken 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 cooked I do not like much less the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 breast I think moss is much better 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 but when I bake my breast 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.059
 it's much better to put him because 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.670
 then as a little monkey as if it were a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.280
 niche and in the flavors are concentrated 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.170
 more then there is double steam cooking 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 and with the dry heat of the oven to double 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.380
 cooking is the chicken 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.290

 you need a new city 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.400
 is what you then give me when three in 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 this weighing also being hidden 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030
 because the oil will all be asking me 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.459
 and I'm going to put capers in the caper 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.010
 which is a flavor that I did not love 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.469
 in this recipe I like it a lot and I'm going to 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.879
 use a few chops is the 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.739
 little head that is going to give us 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.840
 counteract a bit the flavor of the 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.859
 grape the combination of flavors remains 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.859
 delicious and I'll try to see how it is 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.230
 of salt why because the layer you see a 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:45.860
 little salty let's remember not 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.080
 how rich are we going to prove how 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.730
 I'm also going to try mani because if 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.210
 I wanted 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.790
 I felt like too much or too much 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.070
 It means that you have not understood me and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.610
 you ended up I worked so that now I go 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.610
 no one speaks 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.150
 I love I love it is one of my 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.970
 favorite salads and surely to the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.880
 people will love it also make a 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.950
 combination of chicken protein grapes 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.040
 comes ours and I have this 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:23.060
 container here that is watertight where 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.190
 I bring it to work 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.630
 because there are times when cooking does not have 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 nothing to eat 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.580
 and they give us absolutely nothing for being 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.590
 your worried these look how cute 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.420
 in terms of a lettuce leaf 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.000
 here what's called such a fact 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.450
 this is the farm is not the French this 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.180
 it's the sangria either this is the look 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.180
 lady and a step mental function but 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.970
 that windows for the husband is said 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.310
 exactly delivery and well we can 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.170
 increase as a starter because I do not 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.330
 we can stain let's put a bed 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.880
 of lettuces telesur this a little bit 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.510
 I feel important riding the plate 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.510
 good 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.010
 from today I want to be very own 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.010
 less 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.150
 on the side 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.540
 here for example if we are giving 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.490
 as a presentation we can put you 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.350
 some and colorful tomatitos that I have 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.180
 out there and we can put them and we're 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.310
 presenting today to our plate and for 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.040
 a more divided napkin in what thing 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.660
 so delicious I loved you in salt will 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.270
 pop the tomatoes you see 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.210
 it is delicious to what size and good 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.830
 we can put a nuance around here 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.980
 and I just like how the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.750
 presentation in two seconds and less in 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.610
 tomatoes and we're ready with both 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.560
 presentations one to take and one 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.530
 to consume here and I wanted to tell you 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.540
 that in my ceviche that bug I left it to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.520
 room temperature already has like 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.710
 15 minutes out here and it seems to me that 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.080
 it's perfect there goes it needs 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.000
 absolutely nothing remember again 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.640
 the ax callus is not cooking 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.440
 nothing else is changing the texture of his 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.750
 meat that's what the version of 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.180
 lemon and juvenal ok and if I put shrimp 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.130
 It's Dominguez Sunday, they're never going to 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.660
 cook for you to fork a food 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.120
 there is always the word thing is that 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.100
 takes fire of form and very well heat or 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.480
 fire in between always in hours and 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.670
 where are we going then we are going to go to a cut 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.670
