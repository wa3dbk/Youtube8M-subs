do is we split up in this case on

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.120 
do is we split up in this case on
several<00:01:11.549> occasions<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.439> we'll<00:01:13.439> run<00:01:13.650> three<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
several occasions and we'll run three on

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.320 
several occasions and we'll run three on
one<00:01:14.310> side<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.670> he'll<00:01:14.790> run<00:01:14.909> three<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
one side and he'll run three on the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
one side and he'll run three on the
other<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.659> run<00:01:15.840> away<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.350> watch<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.310> building

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
other we run away and watch the building

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.810 
other we run away and watch the building
drop<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.689> easy<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:20.340> makes<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> lot

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
drop pretty easy to do it makes it a lot

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
drop pretty easy to do it makes it a lot
easier<00:01:20.880> sometimes<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.630> capture<00:01:22.020> beyond

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
easier sometimes to capture beyond

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.030 
easier sometimes to capture beyond
conquest

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
conquest

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.499 
conquest
so<00:01:23.490> we'll<00:01:23.640> blow<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.939> both<00:01:24.090> sides<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so we'll blow up both sides of the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
so we'll blow up both sides of the
building<00:01:24.840> early<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> game<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.189> use

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
building early in the game and then use

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
building early in the game and then use
that<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> our<00:01:26.939> advantage<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.560> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> trap

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that to our advantage to kind of trap

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
that to our advantage to kind of trap
people<00:01:29.009> inside<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.360> come<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> two

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
people inside you can only come in two

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
people inside you can only come in two
directions<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.409> instead<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> three<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:32.640> four

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
directions then instead of three or four

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
directions then instead of three or four
unless<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.180> climb<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> side<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
unless they climb the side but when

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.120 
unless they climb the side but when
they're<00:01:34.290> climbing<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.009> easy

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
they're climbing up there are easy
