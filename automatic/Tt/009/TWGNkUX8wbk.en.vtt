 good evening I'm I'm not done 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.680
 I'm the other guy short that's it 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.930
 him who is not known and I wanted 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.060
 tell you a dream that I did 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.730
 the other night actually to situate you that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.970
 it was happening in a very meadow 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.130
 green with pretty grass and I evaluated it 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.480
 pretty mountain valley 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.550
 a bit like in an ad for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 assurances it was actually it was 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.810
 not really a meadow it was more of a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.580
 Versaillais garden with guys all 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.320
 white with wigs as like 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.480
 cancerous but corey not cancer by 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 summer together we ate mothers on 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.540
 feasted the peasants who are 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.860
 arrived with chainsaws and we 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.930
 said we will kill you rich filthy band 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.310
 we will cut off your head so I 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.240
 am running to run but she 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.530
 was shorter is no longer my legs 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.439
 were heavy as if I were running in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.290
 the water of the coup I said to myself ok stop I 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.939
 am going to manufacture there between q I picked up a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.650
 piece of wood I attached a pic this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.570
 magazine with one of my laces I 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.470
 made a door and there at the moment 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.000
 to open the door I realize 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.990
 that there is no handle I forgot the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320
 handle at the beginning of my dream 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.960
 so I go back to the meadow 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.280
 in the Versailles garden I recover 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 the grip and I run to the door 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.210

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.280
