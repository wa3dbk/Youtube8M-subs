00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.180
 where it is impossible because I see no 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.270

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.240
 the place is true i'm a white block of wood and not 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.000
 I know where you can hide here just 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.120
 I forgot the card I remember and ran on it but I 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 a long time ago she ran like this 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.710
 generally there is somewhere on top of already running well 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.990
 ok, for now let's wait 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.900

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.400
 at least a little bit 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.960

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.550
 until the end to get them a coin token 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.420

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.620
 profitable profitable when very profitable 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:18.100
