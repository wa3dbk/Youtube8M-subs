learn so University 100 is a great

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.580 
learn so University 100 is a great
opportunity<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> chance<00:02:16.440> to

I<00:02:22.950> think<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.880> it's<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.120> true<00:02:24.390> hidden<00:02:24.750> gem

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020

I've<00:03:21.590> just<00:03:22.069> got<00:03:22.310> my<00:03:22.340> math<00:03:22.730> class<00:03:23.030> out<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.359> the

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
I've just got my math class out of the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.979 
I've just got my math class out of the
way<00:03:23.750> which<00:03:24.170> was<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> huge<00:03:25.239> relief<00:03:26.239> because<00:03:26.510> it

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
way which was a huge relief because it

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.289 
way which was a huge relief because it
is<00:03:27.230> everyday<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.159> you<00:03:28.760> know<00:03:28.879> you<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> lot

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
is everyday so you know you have a lot

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.990 
is everyday so you know you have a lot
of<00:03:29.329> time<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:29.750> do<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.019> over<00:03:30.079> summer<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:31.040> had<00:03:31.970> a

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
of time to do it over summer and I had a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.640 
of time to do it over summer and I had a
lot<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.239> time<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.629> do<00:03:32.750> my<00:03:32.870> homework<00:03:33.019> because

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
lot of time to do my homework because

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.369 
lot of time to do my homework because
there's<00:03:34.010> homework<00:03:34.220> every<00:03:34.579> class<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.379> there

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
there's homework every class and there

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.410 
there's homework every class and there
are<00:03:36.500> quizzes<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.579> want<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.060> pass<00:03:38.209> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
are quizzes and you want to pass the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.140 
are quizzes and you want to pass the
class<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.530> definitely<00:03:39.950> recommend<00:03:40.400> taking

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
class so I definitely recommend taking

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.440 
class so I definitely recommend taking
this<00:03:41.450> class<00:03:41.659> because<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:43.370> know<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:44.150> can

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
this class because you know it I can

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.030 
this class because you know it I can
imagine<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:45.049> really<00:03:45.290> hard<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.560> take<00:03:45.859> it

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
imagine that be really hard to take it

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.039 
imagine that be really hard to take it
along<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.430> several<00:03:47.090> other<00:03:47.359> courses<00:03:47.690> you

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
along with several other courses you

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.610 
along with several other courses you
just<00:03:48.230> want<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.470> get<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.650> out<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:48.919> way

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.809 

one<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.799> things<00:03:54.010> I've<00:03:54.159> discovered<00:03:54.280> over

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
one of the things I've discovered over

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.179 
one of the things I've discovered over
time<00:03:55.209> is<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.569> students<00:03:55.959> come<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.319> us<00:03:56.470> having

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
time is that students come to us having

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.979 
time is that students come to us having
been<00:03:57.430> rather<00:03:57.670> successful<00:03:57.909> in<00:03:58.450> high<00:03:58.599> school

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
been rather successful in high school

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.890 
been rather successful in high school
but<00:03:59.290> not<00:03:59.590> having<00:04:00.129> read<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.360> much<00:04:01.569> they're

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
but not having read that much they're

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.080 
but not having read that much they're
able<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.230> get<00:04:02.829> away<00:04:02.950> with<00:04:03.250> sparknotes<00:04:03.670> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
able to get away with sparknotes and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.550 
able to get away with sparknotes and
cliff<00:04:04.269> notes<00:04:04.480> or<00:04:04.659> that<00:04:04.810> sort<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.049> thing<00:04:05.140> those

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
cliff notes or that sort of thing those

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.289 
cliff notes or that sort of thing those
strategies<00:04:06.010> won't<00:04:06.430> work<00:04:06.640> for<00:04:06.909> them<00:04:07.030> in
