 There are more than 15 videos there that I 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.660
 only on the question of the domain to be 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 new issue of the new new ball touch 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 dribbling in the style of kick and etc. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.149
 that will change for generation 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.189

 description to check the news there 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.979
 Let's go see the video then. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 basically I 'll start by saying what 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.600
 will not have a 360 that even much more 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.640
 easy for me beauty will not have these 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.670
 beautiful graphics of the next generation 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 also will not have to improve on the cheer 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.259
 crowd will not celebrate like this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 I told you I live, not the example. 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 there the manchester ciry fans that they 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.409
 they are on their backs, this will not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.750
 have a past generation will not have 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.150
 the new grass that will deteriorate 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.210
 nothing old or introduction in the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.579
 stadiums will also not have the issue of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.009
 reality of the players is something that 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.470
 be a little better in 360 and 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.159
 playstation 3 but nothing that will get there 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 to the feet of pc xbox wii and playstation 4 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 If you want to play all this will have 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 what to buy a better pc there a console 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 the next generation to be able to run everything 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.540
 But as what will change then 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.869
 seeing that it will change for the generation 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.270
 I'll explain it to you now. 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.160
 basically - will be equal to one 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.950
 generation to the other and needed new 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.569
 new menu styles 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 it's kind of selecting the players going 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.860
 have everything there for generation past generation 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.260
 future management of teams that also 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.269
 will be present in the game yes that new 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.790
 way you fix your team that okay 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.220
 now appearing on the screen for you will 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.040
 also have a 360 novelty a career 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.230
 So do not worry, old man is going to have 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.910
 also agility control the ball to 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.519
 issue of the first touch the question of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.310
 new dribbles and etc. for the gameplay 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.470
 will be practically the same then not 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.180
 worry about those new things that 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.000
 I already told you they'll be there. 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.489
 present in the past generation and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
 There are still more people the new 20 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.290
 aida martins stadiums will attend 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.959
 in the game as well as the official 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.180
 call and bring your score bringing 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.280
 all there alloy bikes pre sale game 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.950
 This will be in the past generation as well. 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.769
 like new alloys example the Turkish league 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.780
 also and the graph will change will have 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.340
 some improvement rather old basically in 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 modeling of players 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.599
 now they have brought some more 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.459
 reality in new real characteristics 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.680
 another thing they have improved there is 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.780
 matter of messing up the uniform yes now 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.090
 will appear a little more there with grass and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.780
 also with mud and this is a good stop 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.910
 cool 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.560
 And you come and ask me, but on the river. 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.600
 Chinese with which the state will have new 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.970
 uniforms yes new uniforms cast 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.889
 updated and all that I give a 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.139
 version for another always changes old nÃ© 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.850
 you can say there that fifa fifteen is 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.889
 basically a general update with 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.799
 new kits of new uniforms cleats 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.650
 new balls and new teams that have risen 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.510
 division and so on and so the question is 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.609
 A lot of people are already on the network year in 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.549
 comments cut was here already there is 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.780
 basically 14 just changing the face number 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.940
 I'll talk to you in the generation. 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.040
 It's more or less like that. 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.410
 but do not forget that there is an improvement in 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.620
 gameplay as well as the 13th Blonde 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.870
 1414 had improvements always have improvement 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.090
 but the big change even as you go 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.950
 to note is going to the next generation because 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.290
 the graph is really great there 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.359
 new twists come out creating that 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.910
 weather you are inside the stadium 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.650
 crowded and in the past generation then 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.530
 last generation basically what will 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.120
 change is the old gameplay the console already 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.690
 reached its limit it has no way 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.240
 put new graphics 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 can not do more modulation 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.130
 real players per case that console 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.820
 Can not take it, my old ones are already old. 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.770
 friends 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.260
 so I 'll repeat it to you if you want 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.150
 see the same novelty graphical issue that 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.180
 there is a bit of new gameplay there 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.700
 goalkeepers and fans there the stadium in 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.860
 all the stadiums are fantastic dude 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.990
 Have you seen my videos past your speech? 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.390
 exactly about it and it really is 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.720
 too beautiful then I advise you there is 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.100
 catch the next generation in fact but you 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.450
 is one of those who does not care much 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.520
 with graphics just want to know 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.620
 gameplay just wants to know how it is that 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.420
 It's fast and it's alright, it's fine. 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.490
 also knows more fluid new books 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.740
 All this I already told you, it's going to be 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.630
 Just like in the past generation, that's it.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.070
 said more and went 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.110
 first we have the game cover 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.290
 for the gat to the surprise of all 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.180
 is it unlike the Christian ronaldo 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.320
 I used to be, but I thought it was fine. 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.840
 cool cover xvii 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.150
 I found the art even better than fifa eu 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.800
 I do not know why but it was much nicer. 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.290
 Old I do not know if Christian Ronaldo 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.180
 will still not know how the goal is and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.890
 only for Germany, but I do not think so. 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.440
 I think he's the advertising boy of the 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.330
 It weighs now and it looks really cool, old man. 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.430
 Let's go there next time, what are the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.620
 less of the old game 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.950
 I must tell you that they got it right. 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950
 an end
