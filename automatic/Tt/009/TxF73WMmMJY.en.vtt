00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.710 

hey<00:01:14.110> pops<00:01:14.439> in<00:01:14.619> PT<00:01:15.009> after<00:01:15.579> here<00:01:15.820> just<00:01:16.360> when<00:01:16.600> you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
hey pops in PT after here just when you

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.480 
hey pops in PT after here just when you
thought<00:01:16.960> I<00:01:17.020> forgot<00:01:17.170> about<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.890> mollywhop

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
thought I forgot about the mollywhop

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.279 
thought I forgot about the mollywhop
here<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.689> your<00:01:19.990> drop<00:01:20.229> in<00:01:20.590> mollywhop<00:01:21.399> optical

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
here is your drop in mollywhop optical

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.130 
here is your drop in mollywhop optical
circuit<00:01:23.289> board<00:01:23.470> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.299> can<00:01:25.450> see<00:01:25.840> I've

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
circuit board as you can see I've

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.600 
circuit board as you can see I've
mounted<00:01:26.409> here<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.189> piece<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.729> MDF<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:29.610> I've

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
mounted here on a piece of MDF and I've

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.219 
mounted here on a piece of MDF and I've
only<00:01:30.670> had<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.970> picture<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.780> work<00:01:31.960> off

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
only had the picture to really work off

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.480 
only had the picture to really work off
but<00:01:32.619> from<00:01:33.399> what<00:01:33.579> I<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.759> tell<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.490> slider

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
but from what I can tell the slider

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.950 
but from what I can tell the slider
which<00:01:36.789> looks<00:01:37.030> like<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.240> piece<00:01:37.539> of<00:01:37.570> black

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
which looks like a piece of black

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.719 
which looks like a piece of black
plastic<00:01:38.229> or<00:01:38.530> cardboard<00:01:38.710> will<00:01:39.220> come<00:01:39.429> through

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
plastic or cardboard will come through

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.320 
plastic or cardboard will come through
here<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.810> there's<00:01:40.990> your<00:01:41.140> LED<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.330> your

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
here and there's your LED and your

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.350 
here and there's your LED and your
optical<00:01:44.080> circuit<00:01:44.709> there<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.970> we'll<00:01:46.209> actually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
optical circuit there so we'll actually

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.410 
optical circuit there so we'll actually
mount<00:01:46.750> upside<00:01:47.200> down<00:01:47.440> here<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.220> from<00:01:49.149> looking

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
mount upside down here and from looking

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.870 
mount upside down here and from looking
at<00:01:49.479> pictures<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.049> pedal<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:51.250> looks<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.700> if

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
at pictures of the pedal it looks as if

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.350 
at pictures of the pedal it looks as if
though<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:54.009> be<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.369> top<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.970> the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
though this would be the top of the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.539 
though this would be the top of the
board<00:01:55.599> if<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.929> pedal<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.289> upside<00:01:56.709> down<00:01:56.740> right

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
board if the pedal is upside down right

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.639 
board if the pedal is upside down right
here<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:59.110> would<00:01:59.229> mean<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.439> the

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
here and that would mean that the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.020 
here and that would mean that the
battery<00:02:00.069> goes<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.429> there<00:02:00.580> therefore<00:02:00.759> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
battery goes in there therefore the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.740 
battery goes in there therefore the
treadle<00:02:01.420> sits<00:02:01.929> about<00:02:02.259> half<00:02:02.590> way<00:02:03.209> so<00:02:04.209> if<00:02:04.689> we

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
treadle sits about half way so if we

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.510 
treadle sits about half way so if we
flip<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.259> over<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.770> trigger<00:02:06.039> would<00:02:06.250> sit

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
flip this over the trigger would sit

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.339 
flip this over the trigger would sit
like<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.729> at<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.569> top<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.750> my<00:02:07.929> fingers<00:02:08.259> at

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
like this at the top of my fingers at

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.220 
like this at the top of my fingers at
the<00:02:08.440> top<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.679> your<00:02:08.830> toes<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:10.149> means<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the top of your toes that means that the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.430 
the top of your toes that means that the
wire<00:02:11.470> should<00:02:11.709> action<00:02:12.190> like<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:13.170> which<00:02:14.170> means

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
wire should action like that which means

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.190 
wire should action like that which means
that<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:14.920> pulls<00:02:15.220> up<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:16.329> that<00:02:16.959> means

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
that when it pulls up here that means

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.920 
that when it pulls up here that means
the<00:02:17.500> black<00:02:18.459> cardboard<00:02:18.910> which<00:02:19.180> I've<00:02:19.390> got<00:02:19.600> some

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the black cardboard which I've got some

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.569 
the black cardboard which I've got some
here<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.440> black<00:02:20.650> cardboard<00:02:21.630> would<00:02:22.630> go<00:02:22.840> up

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
here the black cardboard would go up

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.599 
here the black cardboard would go up
sort<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.609> up<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.829> then<00:02:26.829> back<00:02:27.579> down

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
sort of up like that and then back down

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.789 
sort of up like that and then back down
again<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.600> lower<00:02:28.780> base<00:02:29.079> sounds<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:29.769> you

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
again for the lower base sounds when you

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.770 
again for the lower base sounds when you
put<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:30.700> heel<00:02:30.910> down<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.450> pedal<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.600> I've

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
put the heel down on the pedal so I've

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.259 
put the heel down on the pedal so I've
got<00:02:34.900> everything<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.410> need<00:02:35.680> right<00:02:35.709> here<00:02:36.269> we've

can also got a battery snap if you like
to<00:03:01.690> use<00:03:01.840> batteries<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.350> course<00:03:02.590> though<00:03:02.889> I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
to use batteries of course though I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.520 
to use batteries of course though I
recommend<00:03:03.579> you<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:04.930> use<00:03:05.170> batteries

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
recommend you don't really use batteries

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.680 
recommend you don't really use batteries
in<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.739> because<00:03:06.010> actually<00:03:06.579> wired<00:03:07.000> up<00:03:07.359> this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
in this because actually wired up this

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.120 
in this because actually wired up this
led<00:03:08.049> directly<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.269> battery<00:03:10.720> terminals<00:03:11.709> so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
led directly to the battery terminals so

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.309 
led directly to the battery terminals so
it's<00:03:12.700> always<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.810> doesn't<00:03:14.019> really<00:03:14.079> draw

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
it's always on it doesn't really draw

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.660 
it's always on it doesn't really draw
much<00:03:14.530> current<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:15.250> you're<00:03:15.400> going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.579> use

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670

batteries<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.120> make<00:03:16.389> sure<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> take

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
batteries just make sure that you take

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.350 
batteries just make sure that you take
the<00:03:17.230> batteries<00:03:17.560> out<00:03:18.000> when<00:03:19.000> you're<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.180> going

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
the batteries out when you're not going

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.840 
the batteries out when you're not going
to<00:03:19.420> use<00:03:19.540> it

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
to use it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.940 
to use it
nidal<00:03:20.180> something<00:03:20.420> like<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.660> holds<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.560> up<00:03:21.740> to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
nidal something like that holds it up to

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.700 
nidal something like that holds it up to
a<00:03:22.390> footswitch<00:03:23.740> so<00:03:24.740> it's<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.100> true<00:03:25.340> bypass<00:03:25.730> and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
a footswitch so it's a true bypass and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.500 
a footswitch so it's a true bypass and
yeah<00:03:27.710> this<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.490> is<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.760> drop-in<00:03:29.240> kit

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
yeah this is so this is the drop-in kit

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.500 
yeah this is so this is the drop-in kit
now<00:03:30.280> should<00:03:31.280> probably<00:03:31.310> try<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.820> drop<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.240> in<00:03:32.330> as

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
now should probably try to drop it in as

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.070 
now should probably try to drop it in as
it<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:34.550> only<00:03:34.670> problem<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.210> mounting<00:03:35.900> it

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
it is the only problem is mounting it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.950 
it is the only problem is mounting it
inside<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.070> chassis<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.060> more<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> case

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
inside the chassis of the more the case

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.960 
inside the chassis of the more the case
now<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.440> notice<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:39.890> there's<00:03:40.070> four<00:03:40.400> screws<00:03:40.820> in

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
now I notice that there's four screws in

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.550 
now I notice that there's four screws in
the<00:03:41.030> Morley<00:03:41.360> case<00:03:41.600> we<00:03:42.200> should<00:03:42.380> probably

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
the Morley case we should probably

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.840 
the Morley case we should probably
situate<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.220> waited<00:03:43.760> about<00:03:43.910> here<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:45.850> here

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
situate it waited about here here here

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.530 
situate it waited about here here here
and<00:03:46.880> here<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.550> what<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.640> have<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.970> do<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.300> try

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
and here so what you have to do is try

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.690 
and here so what you have to do is try
to<00:03:50.570> line<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.930> up<00:03:51.200> with<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.650> slot<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.040> for

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
to line it up with this slot here for

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.280 
to line it up with this slot here for
the<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:55.060> optical<00:03:56.060> blocking<00:03:56.660> mechanism

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
the the optical blocking mechanism

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.160 
the the optical blocking mechanism
whatever<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> hell<00:03:58.100> they<00:03:58.250> use<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:58.990> just<00:03:59.990> try

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
whatever the hell they use and just try

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.380 
whatever the hell they use and just try
to<00:04:00.200> line<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.500> up<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:01.250> closer<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
to line it up so it's closer to the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.180 
to line it up so it's closer to the
original<00:04:02.480> circuit<00:04:03.020> board<00:04:03.470> then<00:04:04.040> you'll

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
original circuit board then you'll

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.470 
original circuit board then you'll
probably<00:04:04.370> just<00:04:04.490> have<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.820> drill<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> couple<00:04:05.150> of

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
probably just have to drill a couple of

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.140 
probably just have to drill a couple of
holes<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:07.340> really<00:04:07.580> there<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:07.940> there<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
holes just really there and there and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.770 
holes just really there and there and
mount<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.930> case<00:04:10.240> if<00:04:11.240> you<00:04:11.300> have<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.570> take

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
mount it to the case if you have to take

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.110 
mount it to the case if you have to take
this<00:04:12.020> off<00:04:12.290> here<00:04:12.620> all<00:04:12.800> of<00:04:13.070> you<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.460> sees

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
this off here all of you so just sees

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.360 
this off here all of you so just sees
little<00:04:14.390> tabs<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.500> there<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.100> look<00:04:16.220> like

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
little tabs just there that look like

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.440 
little tabs just there that look like
they<00:04:16.549> sold<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.260> look<00:04:18.260> at<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.410> back<00:04:19.450> see

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
they sold it on look at the back see

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.180 
they sold it on look at the back see
that<00:04:20.660> looks<00:04:20.840> like<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.140> stable<00:04:21.560> there's<00:04:22.040> just

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
that looks like it's stable there's just

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.060 
that looks like it's stable there's just
paper<00:04:22.460> clips<00:04:22.780> pay<00:04:23.780> clips<00:04:24.110> I've<00:04:24.350> used<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.890> UM

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
paper clips pay clips I've used to UM

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.650 
paper clips pay clips I've used to UM
hold<00:04:25.400> everything<00:04:25.670> down<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.450> in<00:04:26.540> the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
hold everything down on here in the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.160 
hold everything down on here in the
board<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.260> little<00:04:27.920> optical<00:04:28.370> circuit<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.720> you

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
board a little optical circuit so you

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.540 
board a little optical circuit so you
can<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:30.350> snap<00:04:30.740> them<00:04:30.920> off<00:04:31.040> with<00:04:31.250> some<00:04:31.370> wire

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
can just snap them off with some wire

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.070 
can just snap them off with some wire
cutters<00:04:31.580> or<00:04:32.060> whatever<00:04:32.300> obviously<00:04:32.930> you'll

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
cutters or whatever obviously you'll

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.930 
cutters or whatever obviously you'll
take<00:04:33.290> them<00:04:33.470> off<00:04:33.620> all<00:04:33.830> these<00:04:34.040> components<00:04:34.340> here

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
take them off all these components here

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.500 
take them off all these components here
and<00:04:35.890> you'll<00:04:36.890> slide<00:04:37.100> everything<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:38.360> way

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
and you'll slide everything in the way

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.630 
and you'll slide everything in the way
of<00:04:38.660> design<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.350> is<00:04:39.620> you<00:04:39.800> do<00:04:39.920> not<00:04:39.950> have<00:04:40.430> to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
of design this is you do not have to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.630 
of design this is you do not have to
solder<00:04:40.940> anything<00:04:41.660> this<00:04:42.650> switch<00:04:43.190> here<00:04:43.490> is

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
solder anything this switch here is

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.950 
solder anything this switch here is
actually<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.540> this<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:46.100> DC<00:04:46.850> jack<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.420> on<00:04:47.930> a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
actually so this the DC jack is on a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.800 
actually so this the DC jack is on a
clip<00:04:48.290> or<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.920> socket<00:04:49.550> wiring<00:04:49.880> socket<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.600> just

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
clip or a socket wiring socket so just

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.980 
clip or a socket wiring socket so just
disconnect<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.440> undo<00:04:52.040> this<00:04:52.220> screw<00:04:52.810> slide<00:04:53.810> it

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
disconnect that undo this screw slide it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.660 
disconnect that undo this screw slide it
in<00:04:54.110> from<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.470> other<00:04:54.560> way<00:04:54.830> from<00:04:54.890> outside<00:04:55.550> of

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
the case of the inside put the screw

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.280 
the case of the inside put the screw
onto<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.980> back<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.460> hold<00:04:58.640> it<00:04:58.760> in<00:04:58.850> place

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
onto the back to hold it in place

that you will have apart from trying to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.430 
that you will have apart from trying to

mount this in the right spot will be you

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.180 
mount this in the right spot will be you
have<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.830> drill<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.190> hole<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.300> wire<00:05:14.570> pedal

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
have to drill a hole in the wire pedal

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.800 
have to drill a hole in the wire pedal
to<00:05:16.190> accommodate<00:05:16.640> this<00:05:16.790> foot<00:05:17.120> switch<00:05:17.420> which<00:05:17.660> is

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
to accommodate this foot switch which is

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.230 
to accommodate this foot switch which is
much<00:05:17.990> like<00:05:18.260> there're<00:05:18.710> classic<00:05:19.460> war<00:05:19.700> or<00:05:20.090> their

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
much like there're classic war or their

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.500 
much like there're classic war or their
other<00:05:20.360> power<00:05:20.690> wires<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.970> also<00:05:23.210> have<00:05:23.360> to

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
other power wires and you also have to

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.770 
other power wires and you also have to
drill<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.840> hole<00:05:23.900> for<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.970> DC<00:05:25.970> adapter<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.660> have

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
drill a hole for the DC adapter you have

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.330 
drill a hole for the DC adapter you have
to<00:05:26.900> widen<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.530> hole<00:05:27.560> that's<00:05:27.950> already<00:05:28.190> in

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
to widen the hole that's already in

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.999 
to widen the hole that's already in
there

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
there

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.429 
there
just<00:05:29.939> so<00:05:30.089> this<00:05:30.270> song<00:05:30.449> fit<00:05:30.779> through<00:05:31.080> but<00:05:31.259> that's

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
just so this song fit through but that's

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.200 
just so this song fit through but that's
that's<00:05:31.680> fairly<00:05:32.009> easy<00:05:32.279> stuff<00:05:32.729> so<00:05:32.909> you<00:05:32.999> have<00:05:33.119> to

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
that's fairly easy stuff so you have to

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.739 
that's fairly easy stuff so you have to
drill<00:05:33.419> two<00:05:33.599> holes<00:05:34.249> in<00:05:35.249> the<00:05:35.430> actual<00:05:35.849> chassis<00:05:36.449> of

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:36.749 
drill two holes in the actual chassis of

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:38.809 
drill two holes in the actual chassis of
the<00:05:36.779> wire<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.619> then<00:05:38.099> you<00:05:38.189> just<00:05:38.279> have<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.610> drill

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
the wire and then you just have to drill

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.359 
the wire and then you just have to drill
the<00:05:39.029> two<00:05:39.449> mounting<00:05:39.719> holes<00:05:40.110> there<00:05:40.319> or<00:05:40.499> four<00:05:40.860> if

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:41.369 
the two mounting holes there or four if

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.409 
the two mounting holes there or four if
you<00:05:41.610> want<00:05:41.819> to<00:05:42.349> honestly<00:05:43.349> if<00:05:44.210> you're<00:05:45.210> going<00:05:45.360> to

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
you want to honestly if you're going to

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.790 
you want to honestly if you're going to
put<00:05:45.599> this<00:05:45.689> in<00:05:45.899> there<00:05:46.020> I'd<00:05:46.139> probably<00:05:46.409> just<00:05:46.649> get

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
put this in there I'd probably just get

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.719 
put this in there I'd probably just get
some<00:05:46.979> liquid<00:05:47.309> nails<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:47.789> glue<00:05:48.029> it<00:05:48.059> in<00:05:48.240> there

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
some liquid nails and glue it in there

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.829 
some liquid nails and glue it in there
so<00:05:50.729> liquors<00:05:51.059> liberal<00:05:51.330> nails<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.629> strong

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
so liquors liberal nails is strong

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.149 
so liquors liberal nails is strong
enough<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.110> hold<00:05:52.199> this<00:05:52.319> in<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:52.619> wait<00:05:52.800> me<00:05:52.949> but<00:05:53.099> if

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
enough to hold this in so wait me but if

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.589 
enough to hold this in so wait me but if
you<00:05:53.249> really<00:05:53.399> want<00:05:53.699> to<00:05:53.729> attempt<00:05:54.119> you<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.419> just

rip it off and yeah um at the moment

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.510 
rip it off and yeah um at the moment
it's<00:05:59.210> it's<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.449> complete<00:06:01.259> but<00:06:01.589> this<00:06:01.830> induct<00:06:02.339> is

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520
