00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
so basically when a one shot of a series

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.100 
so basically when a one shot of a series
comes<00:00:10.559> out<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.490> know<00:00:11.610> try<00:00:11.969> out<00:00:12.269> before<00:00:12.719> it

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.379 
comes out you know try out before it
becomes<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> full<00:00:13.830> series<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.400> jump<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:15.059> pretty

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
becomes a full series and jump it pretty

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.710 
becomes a full series and jump it pretty
much<00:00:15.570> outlines<00:00:15.890> the<00:00:16.970> beginning<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> story

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
much outlines the beginning of the story

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
much outlines the beginning of the story
that<00:00:18.869> would<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> series<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.250> condenses

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that would be in a series and condenses

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.220 
that would be in a series and condenses
it<00:00:21.180> down<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> full<00:00:22.890> story<00:00:23.720> but<00:00:24.720> when<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it down to a full story but when that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.429 
it down to a full story but when that
story<00:00:25.529> ends<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.480> good<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.660> shot<00:00:27.869> makes<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> feel

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
story ends a good one shot makes it feel

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
story ends a good one shot makes it feel
like<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.710> could<00:00:28.859> still<00:00:29.460> go<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.880> that's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
like you could still go on that's

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.440 
like you could still go on that's
exactly<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.380> shot<00:00:31.619> did<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.450> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
exactly what that one shot did and so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.340 
exactly what that one shot did and so
far<00:00:34.070> Chapter<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.390> was<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.750> good<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
far Chapter one was really good so I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
far Chapter one was really good so I
suggest<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.100> read<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.820> shot<00:00:39.090> first

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
suggest you go read the one shot first

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
suggest you go read the one shot first
and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.960> read<00:00:40.110> chapter<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.620> because

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
characters and it is really refreshing

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.780

to<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.780> story<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.800> jump<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.400> mean

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to see a story like this and jump I mean

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
to see a story like this and jump I mean
you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.060> only<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.780> much<00:02:24.930> battle<00:02:25.320> manga

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you can only have so much battle manga

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.699 
you can only have so much battle manga
so<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.100> about<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.510> story<00:02:28.470> like

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
so it's about time that a story like

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.460 
so it's about time that a story like
this<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.850> jump<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.390> some<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.350> may

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
this was in jump and some of you may

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.550 
this was in jump and some of you may
know<00:02:31.620> I'm<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.130> big<00:02:32.310> fan<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.519> strata<00:02:32.880> 1%

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
town ever wanted to marry her so she

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.250 
town ever wanted to marry her so she
said<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.570> what<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.959> bring<00:03:07.110> in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.940 
eight-pointed mapleleaf I'll marry you
apparently<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:09.959> impossible<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.530> find<00:03:10.739> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
apparently it's impossible to find and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.560 
apparently it's impossible to find and
he<00:03:11.340> pointed<00:03:11.730> Maple<00:03:11.970> Leaf<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.239> guess<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.540> a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
he pointed Maple Leaf I guess like a

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.479 
he pointed Maple Leaf I guess like a
four-leaf<00:03:12.959> clover<00:03:13.200> something<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:13.980> so

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
four-leaf clover something like that so

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.580 
four-leaf clover something like that so
she<00:03:15.180> thinks<00:03:15.329> no<00:03:15.480> won't<00:03:15.750> bring<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.989> most<00:03:16.350> people

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
she thinks no won't bring it most people

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.080 
she thinks no won't bring it most people
give<00:03:16.769> up<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.130> they're<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.519> well<00:03:17.549> no<00:03:17.970> one

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
give up because they're like well no one

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.490 
give up because they're like well no one
no<00:03:18.660> one's<00:03:18.780> gonna<00:03:18.900> find<00:03:19.140> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
no one's gonna find it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.890 
no one's gonna find it
some<00:03:20.130> guy<00:03:20.250> actually<00:03:20.549> does<00:03:20.760> find<00:03:21.060> one<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.510> he

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
some guy actually does find one and he

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.960 
some guy actually does find one and he
marries<00:03:22.200> her<00:03:22.350> I<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.579> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.880> be

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
marries her I think that is going to be

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.870 
marries her I think that is going to be
pretty<00:03:24.150> much<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.390> central<00:03:24.720> story<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:26.130> this

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
beginning because that's how the one

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.780
