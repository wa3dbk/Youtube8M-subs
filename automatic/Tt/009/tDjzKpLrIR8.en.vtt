00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.780
 speak up 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.830
 Today I'm going to tell you 19 Bisping 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:23.609
 new beck and sent him Bisping you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 generates 180 with its backside body and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.949
 360 skate to get you on the edge 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 pink you have to know the Nollie 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 nollie frontside charles io name 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.890
 beckham has two ways of sending or 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.719
 you can only play without knocking which is more 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 easy when you have learning 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.730
 or you can knock and taste in the air 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 only I advise you are trying 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 The easiest way is just playing and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 Turning because it's easier I put the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:09.659
 my front foot here so the good here is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:11.090
 I'm talking about and this one of the other foot 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.240
 others 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 leaving a little here what is going to stay 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.049
 like this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.479
 so when you hit play your 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.210
 body and goes around because together as 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.040
 you will turn from beck the skate has to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 accompany and your body as well 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.409
 so it's no use just throwing your leg 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.150
 without turning the shoulder and the rest of the south 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.439
 So when you hit, let's play. 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.939
 Whether it's going to prepare if you're going to play and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.630
 do and when you 're done after you 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.880
 hit 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.890
 no use going to rotate the body and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.189
 continuously so you have to turn 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.250
 completely and try to look when you 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.360
 come to 70 look back kind turned the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.430
 body and head together you're gonna hit 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 You 'll look because that's the body going. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 turn over and play on the shoulder 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.130
 you'll be fine 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.509
 and when you have that 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 The easiest way I explained was 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.230
 What are you going to do, will you force? 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.330
 with two feet 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.810
 that foot in this direction so and this pre 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.959
 you will pull well over here so 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.400
 there you will generate the skateboard will accompany 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.010
 with the body doing that scheme of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.180
 Generate the shoulder and look at the side look 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.590
 back and then just you usually 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.750
 mark up 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.430
 This was the easiest way to send 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.430
 that if you want to send it and beautiful more 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.920
 High is only you will get the new one that he 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.360
 will rise only hit new and popular 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.610
 So that's it. I'll send it here. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.819
 You'll see what it's like to see the pictures. 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.819
 in purple and back 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.400
