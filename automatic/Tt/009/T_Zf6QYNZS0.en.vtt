 8 million coins in envelopes of 7 thousand 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.080
 500 that are not worth at all 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.940

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.920

 that as it goes then it goes like this until 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 there's no more 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 you can not open envelopes but it's good 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.570
 what there is and good as you see here you have 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.450
 what the envelopes are 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.210
 the option of 36 in an envelope of a and of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.250
 30 is here a legend and here the new 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 which are those of the double tops all of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.610
 the community is to say you can touch 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 both of the vault of the bundes of the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 premier 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.700
 it's absolutely random and then here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 Well, you can touch it 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.860
 specifically 22 of the first 22 of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.930
 the bundes in this on the right and they will go 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.539
 adding as more teams come out of the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.460
 good season we go there to make a 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.920
 test for example we take the one of a 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.869
 be worth we take this envelope to join 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 here you have the information of the purchase 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.160
 and below it puts you that legis teis 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.630
 you see it if you do not realize so 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 you have to register here 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.670
 obviously otherwise 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.080
 directly you see it I'm going to cut 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 this part obviously so you do not see 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.149
 the account and now we see ourselves as 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.310
 you see here it redirects you to the kind of 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.780
 payment can be both write 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 credit cards you have visa 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 good mastercard you have 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.000
 many and good these methods are 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.129
 basically with which you can pay 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.540
 then you can not paypal but 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.250
 good writing is very easy 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.200
 also a written account does quite a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.140
 easy and if not a credit card that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 everyone has and it's much easier 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.140
 As you can see on the screen, the account 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.629
 that I have placed the emails will be sent 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.670
 to the account that you have provided 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.549
 previously for you to send them 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.079
 envelopes and for example here we have I have 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.450
 bought these envelopes and the latter 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.750
 although you see what it says but here nothing 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.489
 this is to unite and effectively we 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.230
 is going to play as you see here you from her 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.269
 a pretty enough left 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.920
 considerable because they are almost one million 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.079
 currency of one million coins 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.910
 well healthy for what it has been worth 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.890
 the envelope the same and the price at which 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.720
 are mostly the currencies that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.989
 comparing the coins and I say fifa 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.000
 already pod to the webs of coins almost 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.670
 always comes out winning, you can play 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 more shit or less shit because this is 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.799
 absolutely random even knowing what 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.530
 is going to touch you is absolutely random 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.180
 but still touching even the worst off 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.440
 almost the same as the pages of coins 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.660
 so I think it's 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.790
 highly recommended this page we are going to 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.280
 open other envelopes that I've ordered here to 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.650
 see we have 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 we have here double cough of the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.930
 bundesliga as you see here that we get 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 de bruijn and manuel and the kids left 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.000
 incredible co here I did have a lot 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.240
 luck as you see 2,700,000 for an envelope 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.120
 that is worth just do not know let's look at 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.910
 see how much this envelope is worth as you see 22 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.430
 of the bundeswehr in those of 2,700,000 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.580
 coins that right now a million is 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.739
 about 15 euros it comes out very profitable now 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.750
 same be over so a leftover 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.320
 incredible right now let's see more 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.150
 to teach you more options not just one 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.489
 here we have double all of the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 bundesliga again we will play here 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.900
 de bruijn and germÃ¡n this is one more envelope 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.900
 normalito because the back and an abuse already 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.750
 I say debt or German million million one hundred plus 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.100
 or less if it is at the price more or less than 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.560
 what is on the pages of currencies to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.240
 the same thing so good more or less is 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.690
 its normal 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 let's see what else we have here 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.020
 we have a third envelope with 30 s we are going to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.470
 see us playing memphis depay mauro icardi 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.680
 and hulk the beast hulk 900 thousand coins 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.770
 what is it that is good for a turn 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.590
 we look here for 88 pounds which is more 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.540
 cheap still than the tops envelope 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.900
 so well it's also pretty 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.720
 normalito the price and let's see the 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.550
 next next and the last one touches us 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.460

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.550
 touches us klain and alexis sanchez 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.350
 million almost a million and a half coins 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 as I say as you are seeing you can 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.190
 compare the prices I cheated on 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.160
 no moment of this with most of 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.160
 the pages that is a simile price and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.620
 the minimum that comes out even if it comes out 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.450
 of the worst always resembles the pages 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.730
 of coins and then from there then 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.170
 I can touch you things like cucumbers 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.270

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.700

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.380
 of kevin de bruyne and manuel not yesterday that 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.900
 the truth has been spectacular 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.880
 so nothing more kids when you have 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.430
 and you have all the envelopes bought and 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.590
 stored in the account or you will see the network 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.490
 in your coins here we select 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.470
 playstation and good here right now I'm going 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.560
 what to arm and talking like again and 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.090
 good as you see here it puts my account 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.310
 in total it has 7 million for all 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.069
 envelopes that I bought so good 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.080
 nothing else remains for us to confirm what 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.939
 it's been 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.699
 of our account and it will tell us the 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.729
 transfer options here always 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.979
 you put yourself strongly that is the most 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.240
 sure to see that we on the page 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.490
 of coins we always tell you that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.120
 Reassure you d not do them because 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.639
 pages 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.919
 you never know they are not a lot 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.319
 trust instead this page 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.169
 we know 100% the creators of the 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.789
 page and we can ensure 100% that 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.879
 it's going to be sure they're never going to remove 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.530
 the coins in this account have never already 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.449
 I say in the pages of coins not 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.340
 make you never comfortable at least 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.560
 It is my advice 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.520
 but here I tell you that it is very very safe 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.280
 here you put the email of the psn account 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.979
 that you have stuck in the play not in 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.099
 not in origin or in the mail, not in the 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.979
 play is worth it if you have whatever you put it 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.199
 here the account will surely be hotmail 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:51.440
 most or gmail but you put it 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:54.800
 here remember mail from the play and so 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.190
 that's your psn password 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.050
 play account and it's already so nothing 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.560
 more down here the last thing you have to 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.480
 put is 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.130
 the password of the question of 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.470
 console security or are you 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.300
 forget about the web ab at this moment and 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.550
 just focused on your account 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.960
 playstation or you put your mail 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.150
 this password in the question of 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.860
 security of the playstation that 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.320
 will always ask you to enter the fifa 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.060
 in the play sometimes asks you the question 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.180
 of security because you have to give it 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:27.080
 from here to verify details and then 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.480
 they will immediately choose the account 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.190
 and they will start to put the coins with 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.410
 players that is no way there is no 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.270
 danger of account way so I 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.400
 is very very good compared to the 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.660
 pages of currencies this method so 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.910
 nothing more kids I hope that I have 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.280
 helped and it's good that really what 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.350
 try it because yes it is going very well 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.570
 this page and the people who take it is 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.070
 to trust one hundred percent that I say 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.010
