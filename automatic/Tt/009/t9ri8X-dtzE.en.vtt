00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
not a huge fan of the laces personally

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.549 
not a huge fan of the laces personally
but<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.820> very<00:00:59.850> unique<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.350> shoes

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but they are very unique the shoes

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.020 
but they are very unique the shoes
definitely<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.129> unique<00:01:02.370> I'd<00:01:02.550> love<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
definitely very unique I'd love that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.850 
definitely very unique I'd love that
outsold<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.580> outsole<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.970> midsole<00:01:06.360> are

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
outsold the outsole and the midsole are

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.780 
outsold the outsole and the midsole are
definitely<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> best<00:01:08.100> parts<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> shoe

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
definitely the best parts about the shoe

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.789 
definitely the best parts about the shoe
in<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.060> opinion<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.659> course<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> midsole<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in my opinion of course that midsole is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.670 
in my opinion of course that midsole is
very<00:01:11.490> reminiscent<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.090> lebron<00:01:12.570> 8<00:01:12.810> actually

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
very reminiscent of lebron 8 actually

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
very reminiscent of lebron 8 actually
the<00:01:13.799> whole<00:01:13.950> shoe<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.520> me<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.850> more<00:01:15.060> reminiscent

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the whole shoe to me is more reminiscent

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
the whole shoe to me is more reminiscent
of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> lebron<00:01:16.110> 8<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> lebron<00:01:16.979> 9<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.000> an

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
of the lebron 8 and lebron 9 which is an

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
of the lebron 8 and lebron 9 which is an
interesting<00:01:18.450> choice<00:01:18.869> although<00:01:19.259> i<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
interesting choice although i think that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
interesting choice although i think that
lebron<00:01:20.909> seven<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> eight<00:01:21.720> were<00:01:21.930> definitely

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
lebron seven and eight were definitely

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
lebron seven and eight were definitely
the<00:01:22.500> biggest<00:01:22.740> LeBrons<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:23.670> i<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.119> know
