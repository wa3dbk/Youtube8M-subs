about<00:01:48.290> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.500> had<00:01:49.710> shifted<00:01:50.960> Duren<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.229> think

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
about if you had shifted Duren I think

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.469 
about if you had shifted Duren I think
it<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.950> instead<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> later<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.270> how

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it was instead of later on like how

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.850 
it was instead of later on like how
different<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:54.930> game<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.350> been<00:01:55.500> do

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
different your game would have been do

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.429 
different your game would have been do
you<00:01:55.920> have

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
you have

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.109 
you have
any<00:01:56.979> regrets<00:01:57.249> at<00:01:57.579> all<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.789> you<00:01:57.850> didn't<00:01:58.030> make

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
any regrets at all that you didn't make

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.130 
any regrets at all that you didn't make
the<00:01:58.240> big<00:01:58.420> moves<00:01:58.600> earlier<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:59.700> do<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:01.359> and<00:02:02.020> I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the big moves earlier I do not and I

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.050 
the big moves earlier I do not and I
think<00:02:02.499> that's<00:02:02.710> something<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.429> is<00:02:03.670> hard

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
think that's something that is hard

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.520 
think that's something that is hard
