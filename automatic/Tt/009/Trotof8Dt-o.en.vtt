or so tumors that dogs get can be mostly

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.820 
or so tumors that dogs get can be mostly
fatty<00:02:13.920> tumors<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.990> can<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.410> malignant

skin tumors like mast cell tumors or

skin tumors like mast cell tumors or
they<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.220> benign<00:02:20.700> tumors<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.720> these<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
they can be benign tumors like these the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.000 
they can be benign tumors like these the
malignant<00:02:24.720> ones<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> piece

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
malignant ones you have to get a piece

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.700 
malignant ones you have to get a piece
of<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.370> taken<00:02:26.820> out<00:02:26.940> or<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.780> needle<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.350> into

current cod are getting in the way of

current cod are getting in the way of
other<00:02:47.880> organs<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> Phoenix<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> not

other organs but a Phoenix is not
walking<00:02:51.090> around<00:02:51.180> us<00:02:51.510> good<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.989> makes

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
walking around us good because it makes

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.290 
walking around us good because it makes
her<00:02:52.350> feet<00:02:52.650> sore<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.340> all<00:02:53.520> these<00:02:53.700> tumors

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
her feet sore to have all these tumors

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.229 
her feet sore to have all these tumors
so<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:55.290> hope<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.560> she<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.340> comfortable<00:02:57.000> just

lovable anyway Phoenix was diagnosed

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.920 
lovable anyway Phoenix was diagnosed
about<00:03:26.400> four<00:03:26.760> years<00:03:26.940> ago<00:03:27.239> with<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> benign<00:03:27.870> tumor

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
about four years ago with a benign tumor

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.890 
about four years ago with a benign tumor
called<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.890> collagen<00:03:29.370> collagenous<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.600> neve<00:03:30.750> i

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
called a collagen collagenous and neve i

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.830 
called a collagen collagenous and neve i
and<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.010> little<00:03:32.130> tumor<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.730> grows<00:03:33.570> under

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and it's a little tumor that grows under

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.070 
and it's a little tumor that grows under
the<00:03:33.989> skin<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.799> stays<00:03:35.430> pretty<00:03:35.730> small<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.930> in

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
the skin and stays pretty small but in

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080 
the skin and stays pretty small but in
her<00:03:37.260> case<00:03:37.500> she's<00:03:37.769> got<00:03:37.980> hundreds<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.700> them

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
her case she's got hundreds of them

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.150 
her case she's got hundreds of them
so<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.810> even<00:03:40.350> though<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.799> benign<00:03:41.100> tumor

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
so and even though it's a benign tumor

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.330 
so and even though it's a benign tumor
it's<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:42.060> causing<00:03:42.750> some<00:03:42.930> problems<00:03:43.160> with<00:03:44.160> her

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
it's it's causing some problems with her

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.400 
it's it's causing some problems with her
getting<00:03:44.610> around<00:03:44.820> because<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.720> painful

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
getting around because the it's painful

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.470 
getting around because the it's painful
when<00:03:46.950> she<00:03:47.130> walks<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.610> them<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> not<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.299> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
when she walks on them it's not like the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.680 
when she walks on them it's not like the
normal<00:03:48.720> tissue<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.500> her<00:03:49.620> pads<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.280> stuff<00:03:50.690> so

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
normal tissue on her pads and stuff so

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.620 
normal tissue on her pads and stuff so
benign<00:03:52.620> tumors<00:03:53.100> are<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.519> fatty<00:03:54.000> tumors<00:03:54.450> lots

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
benign tumors are like fatty tumors lots

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.120 
benign tumors are like fatty tumors lots
of<00:03:54.750> dogs<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:55.110> fatty<00:03:55.380> tumors<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.070> grow

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
of dogs have fatty tumors that grow

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.880 
of dogs have fatty tumors that grow
slowly<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.269> stay<00:03:57.510> about<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> same<00:03:57.989> size<00:03:58.470> and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
slowly and stay about the same size and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.630 
slowly and stay about the same size and
they're<00:03:59.540> cancels<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.690> are<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.489> grow<00:04:02.489> in

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
they're cancels that are just grow in

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.440 
they're cancels that are just grow in
that<00:04:02.760> little<00:04:03.060> area

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
that little area

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.470 
that little area
those<00:04:04.230> aren't<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:04.680> dangerous<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.459> if<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.730> but

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
those aren't so dangerous but if a but

those aren't so dangerous but if a but
if<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.750> growth<00:04:07.370> changes<00:04:08.370> rapidly<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:09.150> gets<00:04:09.420> big

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
if a growth changes rapidly it gets big

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.050 
if a growth changes rapidly it gets big
fast<00:04:11.030> or<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:13.680> gets<00:04:14.250> crusty<00:04:14.549> on<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> outside

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
fast or it gets crusty on the outside

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.920 
fast or it gets crusty on the outside
and<00:04:15.630> gets<00:04:15.810> infected<00:04:16.250> then<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.780> can

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
and gets infected then that's that can

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.900 
and gets infected then that's that can
be<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.260> malignancy

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
be a malignancy

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.660 
be a malignancy
or<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.270> can<00:04:21.420> spread<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.290> cause<00:04:22.680> problems<00:04:23.340> in

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
or it can spread and cause problems in

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.060 
or it can spread and cause problems in
order<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.600> diagnose<00:04:25.080> that<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:25.530> have<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.860> take<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
order to diagnose that we have to take a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.820 
order to diagnose that we have to take a
needle<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.300> put<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.600> inside<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.020> tumor<00:04:28.590> or

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
needle and put it inside the tumor or

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.310 
needle and put it inside the tumor or
take<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> piece<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.420> look<00:04:30.750> at<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.990> cells

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
take a piece of it and look at the cells

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.060 
take a piece of it and look at the cells
so<00:04:31.920> we<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.250> predict<00:04:32.670> what<00:04:32.880> they<00:04:33.240> might<00:04:33.480> do

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
so we can predict what they might do

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.170 
so we can predict what they might do
wild<00:04:35.070> cells<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:36.660> are<00:04:36.810> dividing<00:04:36.840> quickly<00:04:37.770> in

a<00:04:39.180> microscope<00:04:39.750> say<00:04:40.080> gosh<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:40.740> cell<00:04:40.980> this

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
a microscope say gosh this cell this

a microscope say gosh this cell this
tumor<00:04:41.580> is<00:04:41.640> going<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.850> spread<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.990> to

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
tumor is going to spread and we have to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.460 
tumor is going to spread and we have to
check<00:04:43.320> then<00:04:43.860> we<00:04:44.240> then<00:04:45.240> we<00:04:45.300> usually<00:04:45.870> recommend

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
check then we then we usually recommend

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.320 
check then we then we usually recommend
removing<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> whole<00:04:47.640> thing<00:04:47.880> before<00:04:48.240> it

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
removing the whole thing before it

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.950 
removing the whole thing before it
spreads<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.020> that's<00:04:49.740> what<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.910> what<00:04:51.450> we<00:04:51.720> call

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
spreads and that's what the what we call

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.100 
spreads and that's what the what we call
malignant<00:04:52.530> tumor<00:04:55.760> so<00:04:56.760> when<00:04:57.030> if<00:04:57.360> an<00:04:57.540> animal<00:04:57.930> has

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
malignant tumor so when if an animal has

painful doesn't have an ugly infection
then<00:05:27.420> it's<00:05:28.170> doing<00:05:28.710> all<00:05:28.860> right<00:05:28.890> even<00:05:29.700> with<00:05:29.880> a

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
then it's doing all right even with a

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.840 
then it's doing all right even with a
kind<00:05:30.540> of<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.660> gross<00:05:30.930> cancer<00:05:31.470> they<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.460> good

kind of a gross cancer they do good

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.850 
kind of a gross cancer they do good
because<00:05:33.120> they<00:05:33.690> don't<00:05:33.870> worry<00:05:34.140> about<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.590> nearly

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
because they don't worry about it nearly

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.850 
because they don't worry about it nearly
as<00:05:35.070> much<00:05:35.250> as<00:05:35.460> we<00:05:35.670> do

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
as much as we do

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.140 
as much as we do
so<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:37.890> now<00:05:38.070> hope<00:05:38.220> that's<00:05:38.460> how<00:05:38.640> it<00:05:38.700> not<00:05:38.910> having

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
so I now hope that's how it not having

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.340 
so I now hope that's how it not having
any<00:05:39.540> air<00:05:39.750> dogs<00:05:40.520> ways<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.700> prevent<00:05:42.030> cancer<00:05:42.510> pure

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
any air dogs ways to prevent cancer pure

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.900 
any air dogs ways to prevent cancer pure
breads<00:05:43.590> are<00:05:43.770> more<00:05:43.920> prone<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:44.760> if<00:05:44.820> you

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
breads are more prone to it so if you

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.030 
breads are more prone to it so if you
get<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.120> mixed<00:05:45.480> breed<00:05:45.600> in<00:05:46.050> general<00:05:46.680> it'll<00:05:46.920> be

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
get a mixed breed in general it'll be

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.810 
get a mixed breed in general it'll be
less<00:05:47.280> prone<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.700> cancer<00:05:48.350> feeding<00:05:49.350> better<00:05:49.820> dog

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
less prone to cancer feeding better dog

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.660 
less prone to cancer feeding better dog
food<00:05:51.120> with<00:05:51.330> less<00:05:51.630> processing<00:05:52.410> chemicals<00:05:52.920> just
