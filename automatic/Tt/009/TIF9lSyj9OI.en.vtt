00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
balloons because the ones that I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
balloons because the ones that I
initially<00:00:39.899> placed<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> roof<00:00:41.430> are

initially placed on it on the roof are
not<00:00:42.540> enough<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.120> as<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.450> i

the machinery to the ground and let's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840 
the machinery to the ground and let's
see<00:01:02.940> what's<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:04.070> not<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> mention<00:01:05.489> guys

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
but right now is G let's let's see how

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.429 
but right now is G let's let's see how
it<00:01:18.780> works<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.840> i<00:01:22.759> put<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
it works and as you can see I i put I

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.730 
it works and as you can see I i put I
put<00:01:25.439> balloons<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.250> roof<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.270> walls

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
put balloons on the roof on the walls

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.530 
put balloons on the roof on the walls
beneath<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> house<00:01:29.390> inside<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:31.020> house<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
beneath the house inside the house and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:42.590 
beneath the house inside the house and
still<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.900> don't<00:01:36.530> see<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:39.409> flying<00:01:41.119> or<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.360> least

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
still I don't see it flying or at least

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.800 
still I don't see it flying or at least
I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> flying<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.890> expected

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
I don't see it flying the way expected

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.080 
I don't see it flying the way expected
well<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.049> flying<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.770> little

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
well it's flying a little

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.469 
well it's flying a little
isn't<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:52.280> expect<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.700> fly<00:01:54.119> bit

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
isn't it I expect to see it fly bit

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.370 
isn't it I expect to see it fly bit
higher<00:01:54.810> than<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:56.600> otherwise<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.899> won't<00:01:58.109> be

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
higher than that otherwise I won't be

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.429 
higher than that otherwise I won't be
satisfied<00:01:58.969> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.179> just<00:02:00.390> place<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.869> house<00:02:01.109> in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
satisfied if you just place the house in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.850 
satisfied if you just place the house in
the<00:02:01.619> air<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.609> expect<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.299> fly

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
the air and then you expect it to fly

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.749 
the air and then you expect it to fly
that<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> happen<00:02:06.360> guys<00:02:07.729> for<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
that is not going to happen guys for a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.990 
that is not going to happen guys for a
simple<00:02:09.060> reason<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.640> balloons

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
simple reason that I the balloons

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.530 
simple reason that I the balloons
require<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> few<00:02:13.019> seconds<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:17.730> actually<00:02:18.150> fly

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
require a few seconds to to actually fly

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.990 
require a few seconds to to actually fly
you<00:02:18.989> know<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:23.010> house<00:02:23.250> will<00:02:23.970> fall

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you know and the house will fall

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.110 
you know and the house will fall
immediately<00:02:24.750> after<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.890> start<00:02:26.870> testing<00:02:27.870> it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
immediately after you start testing it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:37.330 
immediately after you start testing it
therefore<00:02:32.780> therefore<00:02:35.480> after<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.989> house

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
therefore therefore after the house

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.369 
therefore therefore after the house
starts<00:02:38.340> falling<00:02:38.879> even<00:02:39.120> though<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> balloons

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
starts falling even though the balloons

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.199 
starts falling even though the balloons
will<00:02:41.480> will<00:02:42.480> attract<00:02:43.459> will<00:02:44.459> attract<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.000> house

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
will will attract will attract the house

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.069 
will will attract will attract the house
in<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.599> other<00:02:45.750> direction<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.190> air<00:02:48.079> the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
in the other direction in the air the

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.400 
in the other direction in the air the
house<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:50.430> still<00:02:50.640> falling<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.230> need<00:02:52.380> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
house is still falling and you need a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.150 
house is still falling and you need a
higher<00:02:52.799> force<00:02:54.260> from<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> balloon<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.859> order

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
higher force from the balloon in order

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.360 
higher force from the balloon in order
to<00:02:56.430> actually<00:02:56.670> fly<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:58.709> as<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.160> see

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
to actually fly it but as you can see

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.620 
to actually fly it but as you can see
this<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.940> result<00:03:01.670> upside<00:03:02.670> down<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
this is my result upside down and the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.740 
this is my result upside down and the
house<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.139> tearing<00:03:07.980> apart<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:09.329> not<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
house is tearing apart and not to
