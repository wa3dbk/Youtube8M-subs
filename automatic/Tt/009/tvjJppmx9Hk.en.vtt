00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.570 
by 2 parentheses 3 plus 4 some people
are<00:00:18.600> saying<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.140> should<00:00:19.350> focus<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> 2

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
are saying you should focus on the 2

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.380 
are saying you should focus on the 2
parentheses<00:00:21.420> 3<00:00:21.750> part<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.580> evaluate<00:00:23.580> 2<00:00:23.939> times

3<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.439> 6<00:00:27.500> then<00:00:28.500> evaluate<00:00:29.279> 6<00:00:29.760> squared

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
3 to get 6 then evaluate 6 squared

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.889 
3 to get 6 then evaluate 6 squared
divided<00:00:30.689> by<00:00:30.720> 6<00:00:31.170> which<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.679> 6<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.719> finally<00:00:33.719> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
divided by 6 which is 6 and finally you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.780 
divided by 6 which is 6 and finally you
need<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> add<00:00:34.350> 4<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.700> answer<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.270> 10

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
need to add 4 to get an answer of 10

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
need to add 4 to get an answer of 10
other<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.450> saying<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.079> should<00:00:40.290> look

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
other people are saying you should look

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.850 
other people are saying you should look
at<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> expression<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.579> left<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> right<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
at the expression from left to right you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.330 
at the expression from left to right you
first<00:00:43.860> take<00:00:44.219> 6<00:00:44.640> squared<00:00:45.030> divided<00:00:45.570> by<00:00:45.600> 2<00:00:46.340> 6

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
first take 6 squared divided by 2 6

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
first take 6 squared divided by 2 6
squared<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.879> 36<00:00:48.440> divided<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:49.469> 2<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.039> 18<00:00:51.260> then

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
squared is 36 divided by 2 is 18 then

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
squared is 36 divided by 2 is 18 then
multiply<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.160> 3<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.750> 54<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.149> finally

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
multiply that by 3 to get 54 and finally

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.369 
multiply that by 3 to get 54 and finally
you<00:00:57.329> should<00:00:57.360> add<00:00:57.719> 4<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.770> 58<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> what's<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you should add 4 to get 58 so what's the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
you should add 4 to get 58 so what's the
correct<00:01:01.590> answer<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.850> 10<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.329> 58<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.909> settle

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
correct answer is it 10 or 58 to settle

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
correct answer is it 10 or 58 to settle
the<00:01:06.360> debate<00:01:06.510> let's<00:01:07.350> look<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> internet

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the debate let's look to the internet
