 packaged in it if it's good 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.329
 Chair's what it's good that I 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.519
 here come to adjust the pads 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.960
 the vibration and the different port that 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.570
 have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.800
 ok let's go to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.800
 unpack these beautiful headphones 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.880
 they are already open 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 Let's see 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.300
 we are going to leave them 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:46.850
 we have the model the design sorry 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.850
 genius vibration with a car of fire 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.119
 the microphone the microphone is not a big 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 thing is like the disappointment that brought 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.630
 an I thought good great is great 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.950
 headphones and hard 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 great headphones and more or less 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.989
 microphones more or less listen good 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.700
 let's say that more or less has come down from a 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.700
 10 956 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.050
 power pads 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 They are soft 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.520
 very comfortable for the ear 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.500
 and this in not even know his name 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.990
 know that you tell me to adjust 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.319
 to the size of your head numbers if 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.420
 you get to see 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.170
 it does not look good in numbers from 12 to 0 1 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 al 2 forgiveness 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.180
 on this side too 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.049
 this is like a curtain more or less 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 that the head so if it's not 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.450
 plastic where wrong 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:11.440
 and the microphone that we already directed it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.550
 design and let's go to what this is 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.900
 they all wonder what this is 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.030
 as vibration says 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.000
 to control the hateful vibration 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.490
 for there the active ones to deactivate 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.400
 and here we have what is the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.510
 volume of the headphones there 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.180
 for here, active for low and here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.690
 the mute of the microphone for here 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.540
 from active and here goodbye let's see 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.520
 when you are you need it on and 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.540
 there I think you are going to see today 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.740
 because they are walking 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.500
 let's go to what is the cable the ports 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.500
 the long cable is long 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 two 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:13.319
 As you can see, the most practical are these 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.319
 regular hearing aids microphones 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.280
 in the design of geniuses there you can see 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.850
 you see nothing 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.970
 and here is to bring a usb port well 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.520
 for vibration 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.520
 day 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 this I do not know what is coming 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.819
 good that nothing else are highly recommended 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.030
 for the ears for those who play 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.030
 games 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.830
 for those who cure games is very good or 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.980
 be to listen and that but do not use it 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.900
 for themselves they do tutorials do not use it for 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.700
 speak by microphone use others 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.660
 I recommend them microphones so 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.540
 try it and if you like it good 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.390
 That was all I leave with 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.040
 headphones 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.990
 the truth does not show me much I think that 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.090
 the pairs of 120 Argentine pesos I do not know 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.070
 in your country but good 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.720
 that was all for today I hope that I have 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.720
 liked until later
