00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
relays you drop the cans and up here in

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
relays you drop the cans and up here in
the<00:00:25.150> chute<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.570> they<00:00:25.839> fall<00:00:26.109> down<00:00:26.519> into<00:00:27.519> here

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the chute and they fall down into here

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.499 
the chute and they fall down into here
and<00:00:30.130> I'll<00:00:30.279> have<00:00:30.400> to<00:00:30.519> take<00:00:30.669> that<00:00:30.820> screen<00:00:31.179> off<00:00:31.300> so

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
and I'll have to take that screen off so

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.800 
and I'll have to take that screen off so
we<00:00:31.599> can<00:00:31.779> see<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.910> now<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.329> plexiglass

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
we can see so now that the plexiglass

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.480 
we can see so now that the plexiglass
off<00:00:35.050> is<00:00:35.560> off<00:00:35.829> we<00:00:35.980> can<00:00:36.130> see<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.400> inside<00:00:36.990> it<00:00:37.990> uses

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
off is off we can see the inside it uses

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.880 
off is off we can see the inside it uses
an<00:00:39.490> optical<00:00:39.670> sensor<00:00:40.240> in<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.200> back<00:00:41.410> there<00:00:41.710> and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
an optical sensor in the back there and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.340 
an optical sensor in the back there and
that<00:00:42.010> yellow<00:00:42.250> thing<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:43.080> shoots<00:00:44.080> a<00:00:44.170> beam

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
that yellow thing and shoots a beam

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.870 
that yellow thing and shoots a beam
across<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.890> reflects<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.430> that's<00:00:45.610> just

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
across and reflects and that's just

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.130 
across and reflects and that's just
silver<00:00:46.270> duct<00:00:46.480> tape<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:49.330> is<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.570> rotating

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
silver duct tape this is a rotating

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.080 
silver duct tape this is a rotating
cylinder<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.920> feeds<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.370> cans<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.940> then

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
cylinder that feeds the cans and then

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.140 
cylinder that feeds the cans and then
there's<00:00:52.330> just<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.660> standard<00:00:53.670> push<00:00:54.670> cylinder

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
there's just a standard push cylinder

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.900 
there's just a standard push cylinder
here<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.050> cans<00:00:56.260> fall<00:00:57.160> into<00:00:57.460> there<00:00:57.670> and

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
here so the cans fall into there and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.820 
here so the cans fall into there and
then<00:00:58.420> when<00:00:58.750> they're<00:00:58.870> crush<00:00:59.140> they<00:00:59.350> fall<00:00:59.590> out<00:00:59.710> to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
then when they're crush they fall out to

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.130 
then when they're crush they fall out to
that<00:00:59.980> slot<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:01.180> everything<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:01.780> controlled

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
that slot and everything is controlled

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.050 
that slot and everything is controlled
by<00:01:02.380> just<00:01:03.340> these<00:01:03.490> four<00:01:04.290> air<00:01:05.290> solenoids<00:01:05.860> here<00:01:06.189> so

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
by just these four air solenoids here so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.480 
by just these four air solenoids here so
I'll<00:01:07.330> show<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.630> how<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.869> cans<00:01:08.229> load<00:01:08.530> alright

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
I'll show you how the cans load alright

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.690 
I'll show you how the cans load alright
so<00:01:09.670> here's<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.030> control<00:01:10.390> panel<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:12.549> up

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
can feeder on and so now we'll drop a

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.069 
can feeder on and so now we'll drop a
can<00:01:56.139> in<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:58.119> can<00:01:58.299> see<00:01:58.479> what<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.780> looks<00:01:58.840> like

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
can in you can see what that looks like

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:07.050 
can in you can see what that looks like
so<00:02:02.850> start<00:02:03.850> by<00:02:03.909> taking<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.450> can<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.700> put<00:02:06.939> it

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
so start by taking a can you just put it

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.690 
so start by taking a can you just put it
in<00:02:07.149> top<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:09.069> so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
in top like so

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.460 
in top like so
and<00:02:10.620> if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.800> watch<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.220> control<00:02:12.580> panel<00:02:12.939> there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and if you watch the control panel there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.780 
and if you watch the control panel there
that's<00:02:14.470> senator<00:02:14.830> light<00:02:15.159> will<00:02:15.400> come<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.640> when

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
that's senator light will come on when

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.350 
that's senator light will come on when
we<00:02:16.060> drop<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.420> can

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
we drop the can

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.540 
we drop the can
and<00:02:18.170> now<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.620> knows<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.010> there's<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.280> can

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550
