00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:32.210
 how to eat less without effort 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.870
 less effortlessly set begins with a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.300
 effort that would be the effort of the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.480
 mandibles 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.850
 that is, we need to chew 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.170
 if you chew a lot you will eat 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.590
 me just chew you empty 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.850
 your pockets and saliva so to eat 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.550
 I chewed to eat less do not drink 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.190
 during the meal you drink before subject 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.890
 afterwards but you do not drink during the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.770
 meal times like that you do not have 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 this madness that reopen her ways 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.150
 internal to be able to eat rpt and 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.280
 bake sometimes food that 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.580
 is no longer necessary so the fact of 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.570
 to chew already not to drink 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.490
 during the meal and well you go 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.340
 simplify the amount of food 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.780
 ingested 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.840
 then what does it mean 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.450
 well, that means you have to be 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:39.110
 well installed to eat less 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.509
 you have to eat comfortably so that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 his nervous system relax eating 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.799
 it's also a break 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.090
 it's also a time when the system 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:54.140
 nervous must regenerate we'll say he 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.210
 must the body blows for that 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.369
 the food descendants us and make us 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.350
 good 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.359
 if you want to eat less 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.409
 it takes longer to 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:07.700
 eat take the time to taste you 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.150
 chew longer 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 but between each bite and well take 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.380
 the time to stop suspending 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.890
 listened to almost the flavors 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.600
 intermediate between two bites 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.160
 it's very very different in the 20 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.220
 for the knowledge of wine we go 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.870
 know very well that we will drink wine on 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.640
 will let him go down and then a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.080
 time he was seen 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.990
 we will continue 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.290
 draws milk the aromas that develops 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.690
 in the mouth all this second 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.030
 part of the body's reactions compared 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.970
 this wine is the same for food 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.890
 you have a food that can stay in 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.740
 suspension in the mouth that can be 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.490
 mix with the previous food and you 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.670
 let him live 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.190
 it's a show it's a way of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.460
 take the time and live intensely 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.930
 fully fully this meal one is 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.350
 in the fullness of the fullness 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:11.600
 not being sure much too full 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.180
 of little food is doing it on a 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 longer time 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.480
 eat slowly really take the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.700
 time to make a meal a good time and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.000
 already you will eat less but 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:35.560
 especially breathe during your steps because 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.739
 that the taste is connected to the olfactory bulb 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.790
 if you clog darin times and you 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.019
 eat a dish of smells the tastes do not 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.400
 are not noticeable very little 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:53.750
 perceptible since it is the same source 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.209
 perception that directs the sense of smell and that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.720
 directs the taste so it is absolutely necessary 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:06.110
 breathe to feed on this on more 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.140
 of flavor the breath increases the 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.110
 flavors and nourishes your nervous system 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.459
 and your emotional system for 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.040
 to eat less 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.160
 you have to love eating even more than 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.169
 others need to be a time 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:27.650
 exception in mindfulness and that 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:31.340
 you debut but totally each 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.380
 moment and the art of seeing them you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 will eat - because you will be less 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.340
