00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 and how it works 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.050
 it's just about light 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.030
 the digital camera takes some pictures 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.300
 revolutionaries transforming light into 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.210
 electricity and the camera parts 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 they attract light from the buttons the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 controls and dials to the lenses 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.140
 the digital camera is a revolution 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.140
 for what it does with light 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.180
 transforms light into electrical charges 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.040
 that become the captured image 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.809
 on the screen but how does it work 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 to disassemble it to study the pieces 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 that make this possible 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.050
 and all the parts of the camera 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.589
 contribute to capture the best 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.589
 possible image 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.339
 but the essential thing is that there is light 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.370
 To take a photograph the requirement 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.680
 essential is the light source 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.650
 particles of light photons come out of their 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.300
 source and bounce off the subject and enter 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.690
 in the camera through a series of 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.690
 lenses 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.180
 then the buttons follow a path 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.520
 designed to stop being photons and 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.140
 become photos 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.240
 the photographer can capture the image 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 sharper as possible thanks to a series 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.640
 of lenses that thanks to the diaphragm of the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.350
 photographer's lens controls the amount 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.520
 of light entering the camera through 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.520
 the opening or the objective 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.430
 the light crosses the diaphragm the lenses and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.700
 enter by the target then bounce in 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.380
 a mirror and go to the viewer before 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.370
 get to the viewfinder the light goes through a 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.370
 prism and turns 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 that's why the image appears face down on 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270
 the viewer 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.530
 If the photographer likes the image alone 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.860
 you have to press the shutter the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.750
 mirror rises and light enters during 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 a fraction of a second the light does not 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.740
 directs towards the viewer but goes to the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 heart of the digital camera 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.140
 that is, the image sensor the duration 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.900
 of this fraction of a second 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.520
 depends on the shutter that opens just 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.010
 enough time to expose the 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.720
 sensor light knicks exposure 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 It can be as short as four 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.640
 thousandths of a second 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.890
 that means that in an opening and closing 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.030
 of eyes the shutter can be opened and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.440
 close up to 1400 times 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.950
 like using two curtains one when the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.810
 first the second one opens it closes like this 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.260
 that only a small amount sneaks 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.260
 of light 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.670
 let's investigate the heart of this 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.180
 digital revolution and the element that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.590
 captures the image sensor image is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.749
 a kind of grid grid 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.030
 completely structured and made of 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.189
 tiny light sensors are so 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.459
 small ones that each measure 6 microns of 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.469
 width is 6 million and more parts 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.349
 of a meter on the tip of a pencil 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.389
 could fit more than 5000 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.639
 but before the light must pass through 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:24.450
 something called bayer filter that the 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:26.250
 separates in three colors green red and blue 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.450
 and charged light sensor that can 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.550
 process a single color 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.650
 The light sensor is made of a 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.440
 semiconductor material that absorbs 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.690
 photons when they reach it for every 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.110
 photon that absorbs the light sensor emits 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 an electric particle called an electron 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.450
 the energy of the photos or is transferred to the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.980
 electron that's the electric charge 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.510
 the brighter the image and 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.489
 olatz the stronger the charges will be 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.010
 electric so each electric charge 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.260
 It has a different intensity because 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.730
 then a circuit board translates 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.190
 the different intensities to a 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.560
 computer language that is in bytes 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.420
 or a binary series of ones and zeros that 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.959
 represent millions of small points 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.040
 colored that make up the photo ie 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.079
 text the pixels take the more 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.319
 pixels have a higher photo will be the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.319
 resolution 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.590
 Once this camera has a resolution 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:29.210
 of 3800 72 sexual pixels by 2 thousand 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.780
 Ie 592 pixels 10 million 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.340
 810-megapixel pixels 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.289
 also that's equivalent to 10 million 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.940
 microscopic light traps that 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.849
 they work with all the other components 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.349
 of the camera with a single objective 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.960
 convert light into electricity to 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.289
 that taking pictures is the simplest 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.289
 possible
