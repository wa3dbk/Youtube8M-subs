00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it appears that the best move in this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.780 
it appears that the best move in this
position<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.799> capture<00:02:02.399> bishop<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.420> g4<00:02:03.930> and

position is to capture bishop on g4 and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.389 
position is to capture bishop on g4 and
then<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.329> continuation

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
then we will have this continuation

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.559 
then we will have this continuation
Knight<00:02:08.399> takes<00:02:08.670> Knight<00:02:08.910> Queen<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.530> d1<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
white is doing very well

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.400

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.250 
instead white played Bishop to g5 and
this<00:02:20.100> looks<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:21.060> good<00:02:21.390> move<00:02:21.630> why

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
this looks like a very good move why

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
this looks like a very good move why
developed<00:02:22.680> his<00:02:22.830> Bishop<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.430> Bishop<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.970> doing

developed his Bishop and Bishop is doing

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.610 
developed his Bishop and Bishop is doing
very<00:02:24.660> important<00:02:25.170> job

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
very important job

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.610 
very important job
pinning<00:02:26.280> Knight<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.080> white

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
pinning Knight and this is what white

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.060 
pinning Knight and this is what white
calculated<00:02:29.460> if<00:02:30.120> Knight<00:02:30.750> takes<00:02:31.050> Knight<00:02:31.170> then

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
calculated if Knight takes Knight then

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.570 
calculated if Knight takes Knight then
pawn<00:02:32.850> takes<00:02:33.180> Knight<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.950> he<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.340> win

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
pawn takes Knight and he is going to win

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.370 
pawn takes Knight and he is going to win
knight<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.300> f6<00:02:36.450> because<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.320> pinned<00:02:39.200> when<00:02:40.200> he

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
knight on f6 because it's pinned when he

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.760 
knight on f6 because it's pinned when he
saw<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.780> was<00:02:42.840> beginning<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.470> be

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
saw this it was beginning to be

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.020 
saw this it was beginning to be
extremely<00:02:44.250> happy<00:02:44.490> looks<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.920> White

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
extremely happy looks like that White
