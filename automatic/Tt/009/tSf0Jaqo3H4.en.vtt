00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
hey guys John from surf FX today we're

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.509 
hey guys John from surf FX today we're
looking<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.140> new<00:00:07.470> starboard<00:00:08.069> airborne

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
looking at the new starboard airborne

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.629 
looking at the new starboard airborne
this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> 7<00:00:09.330> 10<00:00:09.480> by<00:00:09.660> 30<00:00:09.980> it's<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.099> real<00:00:11.339> nugget

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
this is a 7 10 by 30 it's a real nugget

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.240 
this is a 7 10 by 30 it's a real nugget
of<00:00:11.879> a<00:00:11.940> board<00:00:12.440> 97<00:00:13.440> liters<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:13.860> it'll<00:00:14.009> float

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
of a board 97 liters but it'll float

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.940 
of a board 97 liters but it'll float
more<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> 110<00:00:15.900> leader<00:00:16.110> board<00:00:16.410> it's

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
more like about a 110 leader board it's

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.550 
more like about a 110 leader board it's
got<00:00:17.130> extra<00:00:17.430> width<00:00:17.720> when<00:00:18.720> real<00:00:19.050> thin<00:00:19.350> board

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
got extra width when real thin board

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.860 
got extra width when real thin board
it's<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.160> slightly<00:00:20.700> in<00:00:20.940> the<00:00:21.150> water<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
it's it's slightly in the water with a

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.090 
it's it's slightly in the water with a
little<00:00:22.170> bit<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.320> water<00:00:22.470> lapping<00:00:22.770> over<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
little bit of water lapping over the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.410 
little bit of water lapping over the
tail<00:00:23.280> gives<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.940> a<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.120> bit<00:00:24.210> more

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
tail gives it a little bit more

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.970 
tail gives it a little bit more
stability<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.870> having<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.290> Corky<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.830> on

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
stability than having a Corky right on

the board itself is super super light in
this<00:01:05.670> carbon<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.480> got<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
this carbon this has got to be one of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.900 
this carbon this has got to be one of
the<00:01:07.050> lightest<00:01:07.320> boards<00:01:07.620> we've<00:01:07.740> had<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
the lightest boards we've had we do a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.460 
the lightest boards we've had we do a
lot<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> lot<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.690> high<00:01:09.780> performance<00:01:10.170> boards

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
lot a lot of high performance boards

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.720 
lot a lot of high performance boards
this<00:01:10.980> is<00:01:11.160> just<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> start<00:01:13.470> touch<00:01:13.650> deck<00:01:13.920> nice

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
this is just the start touch deck nice

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.660 
this is just the start touch deck nice
touch<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.710> gets<00:01:16.710> grippy<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> gets<00:01:17.490> wet

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
touch on it gets grippy when it gets wet

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.020 
touch on it gets grippy when it gets wet
so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.120> touch<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.660> slides<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.440> easy<00:01:20.220> but

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so you touch it it slides on easy but

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.850 
so you touch it it slides on easy but
it's<00:01:21.120> got<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.450> bite<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.620> of<00:01:22.680> guys

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it's got some bite to it a lot of guys

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
it's got some bite to it a lot of guys
will<00:01:23.040> throw<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.250> tail<00:01:23.460> pad<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.360> option<00:01:24.780> up
