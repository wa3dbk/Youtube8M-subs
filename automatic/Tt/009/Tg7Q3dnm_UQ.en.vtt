00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.789
 the next his mother numbers 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.910
 we make 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.279
 we did not resolve simply to do 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.029
 multiply 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.459
 for expensive 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.929
 without before 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.650
 so 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.900
 climbed 7 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.339
 the 21st 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.669
 21 + 2 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.949
 2. 3 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.999
 trini or three 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.249
 vÃ­ctor morlan to move where they multiply 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.310
 and later 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.400
 four bodies 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 iu affirms 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.490
 take out all achieve least common multiple between three and four 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.720
 which 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.030
 300 in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.540
 four for 23 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 portu for three 12 4 8 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080
 92 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.190
 4 in 12 3 and that by nine 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 27 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300
 this sum was taken 92 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.970
 27 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.350
 which gives us 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.980
 119 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 divided 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.250
 I'm going to add 6 integers 11 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.720
 plus 4 integers 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.800
 curly 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.710
 we transform 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090
 same as the previous situation multiplying and then 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.400
 you know in 36 patentiza and we add the ud 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
 37s 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 the same situation multiplies mobile 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.440
 8 with four 32 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.470
 32 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 35 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 divided 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.250
 now we do assume 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.330
 taking out the least common multiple 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.990
 between 6 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.490
 which is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.209
 24 can not verify making the corresponding table 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.689
 in 24 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.779
 and four times 37 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.819
 4 possible 28 2 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.229

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.959

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.879
 reporter 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.209
 10 min 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.829
 I feel if 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.580
 they raped for his mother 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.409
 148 +105 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:43.749
 or we are five 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.829

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.289
 none 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.569
 therefore it gives 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.249
 253 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:55.849
