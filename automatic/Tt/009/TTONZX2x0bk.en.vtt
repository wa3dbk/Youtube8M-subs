the<00:00:29.109> DuPont<00:00:29.800> motorcycle<00:00:30.580> chain<00:00:30.849> degreaser<00:00:31.510> to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
the DuPont motorcycle chain degreaser to

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:40.470 
the DuPont motorcycle chain degreaser to
the<00:00:31.810> chain<00:00:38.850> okay<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.000> first<00:00:40.120> thing<00:00:40.269> you're

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
the chain okay the first thing you're

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.090 
the chain okay the first thing you're
going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.690> do<00:00:40.839> is<00:00:40.989> find<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.350> master<00:00:41.739> link<00:00:41.920> on

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
going to do is find the master link on

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.819 
going to do is find the master link on
the<00:00:42.190> chain<00:00:42.460> as<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:43.540> can<00:00:43.690> see<00:00:43.899> I<00:00:44.170> pointed<00:00:44.710> out

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
the chain as you can see I pointed out

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.950 
the chain as you can see I pointed out
here<00:00:45.160> in<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.460> video<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:45.969> you're<00:00:46.809> going<00:00:46.930> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
here in the video and you're going to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.810 
here in the video and you're going to
use<00:00:47.110> that<00:00:47.140> as<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.469> starting<00:00:47.950> point<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.370> an<00:00:48.610> end

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
use that as a starting point and an end

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.369 
use that as a starting point and an end
point<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.539> way<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.750> don't<00:00:49.899> have<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.230> use

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
point so that way you don't have to use

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.100 
point so that way you don't have to use
any<00:00:50.590> more<00:00:50.770> degreaser<00:00:51.370> than<00:00:51.579> necessary<00:00:52.480> go

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
any more degreaser than necessary go

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.290 
any more degreaser than necessary go
ahead<00:00:53.289> and<00:00:53.410> shake<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.739> can<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.250> apply<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
ahead and shake the can and apply the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.959 
ahead and shake the can and apply the
chain<00:00:55.899> degreaser<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:57.070> both<00:00:57.280> sides<00:00:57.610> of<00:00:57.850> the

said I wash my bike when I clean my
chain<00:02:23.060> because<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.390> makes<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.750> lot<00:02:23.870> easier

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
chain because it makes it a lot easier

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.890 
chain because it makes it a lot easier
and<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.460> way<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.760> make<00:02:26.120> sure<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.660> chain

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
and that way I can make sure the chain

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:41.860 
and that way I can make sure the chain
is<00:02:27.170> fully<00:02:27.440> clean
