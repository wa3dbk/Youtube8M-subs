00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
covered those two let's talk about the

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.789

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
custom variation

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.190 
custom variation
this<00:02:03.070> one<00:02:03.310> actually<00:02:03.640> isn't<00:02:04.509> necessary

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
this one actually isn't necessary

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.690 
this one actually isn't necessary
however<00:02:05.469> it's<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.890> little<00:02:06.100> flashy<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.609> it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
however it's a little flashy and it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.349 
however it's a little flashy and it
looks<00:02:06.850> nice

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
looks nice

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.779 
looks nice

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
so to go about this one so what you

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.220 
so to go about this one so what you
would<00:02:09.850> want<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.179> do<00:02:10.329> is<00:02:10.450> approach<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.140> it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
would want to do is approach to it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.110 
would want to do is approach to it's
like<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> last<00:02:11.650> combo<00:02:12.130> however<00:02:12.640> instead<00:02:12.940> of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like the last combo however instead of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.690 
like the last combo however instead of
doing<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.510> down<00:02:13.780> medium<00:02:14.109> down<00:02:14.590> heavy<00:02:14.890> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
doing a down medium down heavy you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.430 
doing a down medium down heavy you
actually<00:02:16.090> want<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.299> jump<00:02:16.600> again<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:16.930> do<00:02:17.140> two

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
actually want to jump again and do two

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.500 
actually want to jump again and do two
mediums<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.250> soar<00:02:18.549> forward<00:02:18.970> heavy<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
mediums and soar forward heavy as you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.900 
mediums and soar forward heavy as you
can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.140> right<00:02:20.260> here<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:20.709> once<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.609> do<00:02:21.700> that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
can see right here so once you do that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.819 
can see right here so once you do that
again<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.660> could<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:22.840> continue<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.650> if

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
again you could just continue it as if

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.820 
again you could just continue it as if
it<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.100> corner<00:02:24.430> calm

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
it was a corner calm

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.220 
it was a corner calm
and<00:02:25.220> continue<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.820> reps<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.930> hope<00:02:27.110> this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
and continue the reps so I hope this

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.070 
and continue the reps so I hope this
