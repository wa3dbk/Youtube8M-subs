00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.070
 gave it to people this blast furnace lÃ©o 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.500
 that today, like that, he will be able to see 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.359
 this gameplay on strike zone at vk is 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.220
 so lifted a very very good sniper class 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.619
 so I have it with the fact that he has a 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.119
 silent included in without the added 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.560
 so that's great fun 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.050
 so you have not revisit that the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.430
 gameplay is pretty good it's really 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.169
 my best ice gameplay of which I 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.700
 am really very proud of being able to 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.170
 you present it today and I will 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.120
 told a little bit about how I do them and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.350
 it's rather funny so first of all 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.969
 this is the first one that I need the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.050
 know 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.210
 audika is that sense was scared very good 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.890
 as I already said ms and thursday in a 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.300
 hotel in evian because i'm taking 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.859
 there for a family dinner so the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 diane's telling me all weekend 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.159
 so I see people in the family that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.499
 I'll never even see before so here 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.539
 this pleasure so I come back from tennis 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.670
 and then to last night going to bed 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.979
 we know why not a toy on the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.780
 xbox one passionately xbox so is 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.789
 played on a huge TV so really 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.859
 hard to get used to and after three parts 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.120
 I go out that so it does not crack a lot of 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.960
 balls in the gameplay monge france 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 you can understand it 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.560
 I am not at home and I wanted 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.720
 the huge so it's not easy to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 keep a good shot especially by changing 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.180
 as much as I did there we are in 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.830
 vacation then by being at home and 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.910
 come back on one on a connection is 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.800
 she plus a big TV that makes 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.660
 weird it changed me a lot 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.130
 shoot but came back this gameplay then 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.530
 the gt is on the ass honestly I 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.040
 was waiting for me traitor is so not 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.060
 sorry to enter a gameplay like this and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.280
 what is funny anyway is that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.710
 I do the cream and that to 25 who the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 strict game I do a cross of life so 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.770
 just after the cam i'm going to make a 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.360
 cross on it so it'll be pretty 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.310
 huge it's pretty epic 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.620
 I really think my best gameplay 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.790
 on ghost every time and I'll you 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.830
 fucked really happy for you the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.240
 present today because I said 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.710
 that I do the gameplay chora wac is this 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.640
 what am I doing here what is it 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.620
 what's that bullshit 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.940
 and then the enemies in front that I like 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.770
 well say it is not magician must 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.480
 to be honest he was really worthless 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.580
 was not exceptional we could see 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.750
 they did not shoot me much but 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.310
 good this is not this opinion I you 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.680
 prove if you want to soissons 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.990
 why I brake cheese set up 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.820
 it's disgusting and we can also see 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.229
 that the enemies are good to kill me and 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.700
 the part of time they will not return 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 only because I then have 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.000
 so I'm not displayed on the radar 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.680
 so here we can see that I start to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.879
 tell me good why not make a cream 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.470
 chigiana nine districts 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.940
 see you soon alice so here I think I 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.020
 are going to be shopping and said that so 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.280
 I miss a lot of balls when I 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.410
 say there really is the lagoon 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.730
 part of the gameplay chances a guy who 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.800
 shoot me I start killing two 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.640
 other guys and then there is the guy who 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.810
 below who is looking for me 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 I do not have where he has I see they show 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 this game jumps and I make the big kill 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.240
 stroke of luck lemay treatment that 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.130
 was I'm not converged at the point that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.900
 he had no pad should not when he 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.110
 did honestly really big shot of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.550
 luck 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.930
 and then from the moment that there is that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.160
 that happened I thought it was good 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 maybe not scratched for example 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.310
 maybe I'm doing something there 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.480
 there is way to put something especially 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030
 that the two previous parts I had 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.170
 also made big kill streaks was 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.600
 since I came back I did a 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.920
 fifteen kilos that has more than 15 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.030
 so really I think I started 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.780
 to return more Lent because I have 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.790
 the impression that the community has 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.370
 much changed since I left in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.840
 holiday is not bad here it's done 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 pleasure still to designate 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.050
 a lot easier because before leaving 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.140
 on vacation I had the big community 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.250
 traits so it was really pissed off 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.140
 ghost was disgusting I was just playing 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.069
 because of the community and then from 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.239
 that he falls into lobbies like that 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.800
 that's where you see that ghost actually 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.910
 it's a game that's very, very good 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.430
 part of my there are no campers 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.080
 so here I was already in a very very 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120
 nice series I have a hard time saying is that 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.890
 I am here I do not know at all I have 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.180
 consciousness in 10 01 and schl at 18 dock 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.670
 strict so I did not know at all I 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.750
 thought I was only at 14 or 15 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.220
 now I was playing so much not 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.980
 concentrated I was talking with my mother who 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.239
 was widely and really a really 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.410
 gameplay I was not focused on 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.820
 everything so there that I saw that I was 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.200
 quite high I thought, well, we're not going 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.700
 to make the con no more I'm for sale 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.590
 and strict then there big moments of 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.670
 stress you swear I did not want to 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.350
 die so I thought we're not going 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.299
 too much rock we will keep calm both 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.940
 enemies I the frozen marker spleen hits 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.320
 in addition because of this axis is such and 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.370
 precisely so is created there I 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.079
 really started to stress young or 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.190
 good I'll die if I can not get 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.540
 do as soon as they see designated to 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.680
 through the walls I can not kill them 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.959
 because of my zealous who prevail in 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.430
 more so there I say okay ok we get 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.470
 calm we'll try to get some 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.390
 thing you must not rush talent 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.810
 As there is still you five minutes 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.400
 gameplay 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.600
 you can do it I can really 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.250
 to do and that's when I say to myself 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.660
 good ah I can not miss game we have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.370
 stole every island so here I hit 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.329
 really we were stressed because soon 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.650
