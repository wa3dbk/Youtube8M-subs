00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
hello this video introduces a prototype

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200 
hello this video introduces a prototype
of<00:00:05.670> 3d<00:00:06.540> keyboard<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:08.099> enables<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.910> type

and typing method introduced on Android

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
and typing method introduced on Android
simply<00:00:18.900> set<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.340> eight<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.330> three

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
simply set it is eight and in three

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.250 
simply set it is eight and in three
dimensions<00:00:22.699> let's<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:24.210> how<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> works

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
dimensions let's see how it works

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.730

by entering some sequence of the cues so

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.859 
by entering some sequence of the cues so
let's<00:01:10.409> write<00:01:10.770> our<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> hello<00:01:11.490> world<00:01:11.610> example<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
let's write our a hello world example it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.760 
let's write our a hello world example it
this<00:01:13.710> 3d<00:01:14.250> keyboard<00:01:14.880> let's<00:01:15.600> start<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.439> typing

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this 3d keyboard let's start by typing

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
this 3d keyboard let's start by typing
age<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.600> requires<00:01:19.140> me<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> move<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:20.549> hand<00:01:21.119> down

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
age it requires me to move my hand down

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
age it requires me to move my hand down
to<00:01:21.720> activate<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.530> bottom<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.600> fours<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to activate the bottom two fours and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
to activate the bottom two fours and
back<00:01:27.680> then<00:01:28.680> let's<00:01:29.159> type<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.689> similar

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
back then let's type in it in a similar

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:42.560 
back then let's type in it in a similar
way

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.010 

now<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.560> type<00:01:44.370> space<00:01:44.850> by<00:01:45.120> moving<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.690> head

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now I will type space by moving my head

00:01:46.020 --> 00:02:03.719 
now I will type space by moving my head
back<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.920> forth

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.380 

so<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.079> our<00:02:05.259> whole<00:02:05.590> world<00:02:05.920> example<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so this is our whole world example the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.710 
so this is our whole world example the
3d<00:02:07.899> keyboard<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.890> using<00:02:09.369> Microsoft<00:02:10.030> Xbox
