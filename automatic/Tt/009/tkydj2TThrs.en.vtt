have a hard plastic which I'm actually a
tiny<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.049> worried<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.589> could

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
tiny bit worried that this could

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
tiny bit worried that this could
potentially<00:01:05.040> scratch<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:06.060> iPad<00:01:06.450> air

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
potentially scratch my iPad air

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.840 
potentially scratch my iPad air
especially<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.189> any<00:01:08.340> type<00:01:08.670> of

dirt<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.270> debris<00:01:09.510> gets<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.409> could

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
dirt or debris gets in there it could

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700 
dirt or debris gets in there it could
rub<00:01:11.280> against<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> scratch<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:12.810> time<00:01:13.170> now

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
rub against it and scratch over time now

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
rub against it and scratch over time now
this<00:01:13.830> case<00:01:14.070> also<00:01:14.310> resembles<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> smart<00:01:15.119> cover

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
this case also resembles the smart cover

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
this case also resembles the smart cover
because<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> still<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.860> magnets

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

which<00:01:40.229> looks<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.560> nice<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> can't

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
which looks pretty nice so if you can't

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
which looks pretty nice so if you can't
tell<00:01:42.000> already<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> big<00:01:43.020> fan<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
tell already I'm really a big fan of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
tell already I'm really a big fan of
this<00:01:43.409> case<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.060> any<00:01:45.180> major

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this case I don't really have any major

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
this case I don't really have any major
flaws<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> couple<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.770> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
flaws but I have a couple things that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
flaws but I have a couple things that
I've<00:01:47.130> liked<00:01:47.280> improved<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> text<00:01:48.990> from

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I've liked improved one the text from

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
I've liked improved one the text from
the<00:01:49.200> back<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.710> doesn't<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> lot<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.189> oils<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the back it doesn't get a lot of oils so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
the back it doesn't get a lot of oils so
that<00:01:51.299> would<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.600> been<00:01:51.630> nicer<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.320> could

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that would have been nicer if it could

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.980 
that would have been nicer if it could
have<00:01:52.979> resisted<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.689> pretty

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
have resisted that was also it's pretty

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
have resisted that was also it's pretty
thick<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.500> least<00:01:55.619> compared<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.130> smart<00:01:56.729> cover

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
thick at least compared to a smart cover

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
thick at least compared to a smart cover
only<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.659> guess<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.979> spoiled

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
only I guess I got a little bit spoiled

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
only I guess I got a little bit spoiled
by<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> big<00:02:01.079> fan<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
by that but I'm also not a big fan of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
by that but I'm also not a big fan of
the<00:02:02.070> viewing<00:02:02.549> angles<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> stander

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the viewing angles in the stander

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.749 
the viewing angles in the stander
instant<00:02:04.170> landscape<00:02:04.590> mode<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> really

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
instant landscape mode it's a really

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
instant landscape mode it's a really
really<00:02:06.030> steep<00:02:06.299> angle<00:02:06.840> probably<00:02:07.259> 80<00:02:07.530> some

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
really steep angle probably 80 some

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.800 
really steep angle probably 80 some
degrees<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> big<00:02:09.629> fan

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
degrees and I'm just I'm not a big fan

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.630 
degrees and I'm just I'm not a big fan
that<00:02:10.080> doesn't<00:02:10.110> make<00:02:10.800> watching<00:02:11.280> videos<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that doesn't make watching videos and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.770 
that doesn't make watching videos and
any<00:02:12.239> type<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.510> landscape<00:02:13.050> viewing<00:02:13.410> very

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
any type of landscape viewing very

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.809 
any type of landscape viewing very
well<00:02:14.050> sort<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.920> liked<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.459> bit<00:02:15.550> smaller

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
well sort of liked a little bit smaller

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.430 
well sort of liked a little bit smaller
of<00:02:15.970> an<00:02:16.060> angle<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:16.540> overall<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.020> big<00:02:17.200> fan<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
of an angle but overall I'm a big fan of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.660 
of an angle but overall I'm a big fan of
this<00:02:17.680> sort<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.280> be<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> little<00:02:18.520> bit

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
this sort of like to be a little bit

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.949 
this sort of like to be a little bit
thinner<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.030> bit<00:02:19.240> better<00:02:19.360> landscape

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
thinner a little bit better landscape

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.150 
thinner a little bit better landscape
angle<00:02:20.380> what's<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.040> really

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
angle what's a really

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.920 
angle what's a really
professional-looking<00:02:21.760> case<00:02:22.330> especially<00:02:22.569> in

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
professional-looking case especially in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.699 
professional-looking case especially in
the<00:02:23.020> gray<00:02:23.170> color

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
the gray color

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.010 
the gray color
I<00:02:23.740> really<00:02:24.400> am<00:02:24.580> digging<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.180> color<00:02:25.510> scheme<00:02:25.990> of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
I really am digging the color scheme of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.390 
I really am digging the color scheme of
this<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> overall<00:02:26.890> designs<00:02:27.220> really
