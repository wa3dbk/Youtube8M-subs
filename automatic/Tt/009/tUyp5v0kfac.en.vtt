the arm the prime mover is the brice EPS
brachii<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.880> contracts<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> most<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.230> order

brachii it contracts the most in order

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.450 
brachii it contracts the most in order
to<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> arm<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> move<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.670> way

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
to get the arm to move in this way

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
to get the arm to move in this way
synergistic<00:00:41.460> muscles<00:00:41.910> these<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.079> muscles

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
synergistic muscles these are muscles

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
synergistic muscles these are muscles
that<00:00:43.770> either<00:00:44.070> assist<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> movement

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that either assist with the movement

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.020 
that either assist with the movement
they<00:00:45.629> help<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> biceps<00:00:46.500> brachii<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.969> do

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
they help the biceps brachii or they do

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
they help the biceps brachii or they do
other<00:00:48.270> things<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.170> movement<00:00:49.559> like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
other things for the movement like

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.299 
other things for the movement like
stabilize<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.730> joints<00:00:51.120> involved<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:53.280> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stabilize the joints involved so when I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
stabilize the joints involved so when I
do<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> movement<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:55.079> order<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
do this kind of movement in order to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
do this kind of movement in order to
keep<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.070> upper<00:00:56.280> arm<00:00:56.640> steady<00:00:57.120> while<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
keep the upper arm steady while the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
keep the upper arm steady while the
movement<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> happening<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:59.039> example<00:00:59.460> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
movement is happening for example the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.209 
movement is happening for example the
pectoralis<00:01:00.449> muscle<00:01:01.199> holds<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> joint

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
pectoralis muscle holds on to the joint

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.050 
pectoralis muscle holds on to the joint
and<00:01:02.370> keeps<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> steady<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.270> does<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:05.060> deltoid

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and keeps it steady so does the deltoid

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.960 
and keeps it steady so does the deltoid
muscle<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.650> latissimus<00:01:08.220> dorsi<00:01:08.250> may<00:01:08.909> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
muscle and the latissimus dorsi may be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
muscle and the latissimus dorsi may be
involved<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.840> might<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> trapezius<00:01:10.799> all

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
involved in so might the trapezius all

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
involved in so might the trapezius all
of<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.820> considered<00:01:12.299> synergists

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of those would be considered synergists

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
of those would be considered synergists
for<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> movement<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:16.490> antagonistic

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
for this movement the antagonistic

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
for this movement the antagonistic
muscle<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> movement<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
muscle for this movement where the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
muscle for this movement where the
biceps<00:01:20.009> brachii<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.580> flexing<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> arm<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
biceps brachii is flexing the arm the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
biceps brachii is flexing the arm the
antagonistic<00:01:22.680> muscle<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
antagonistic muscle is going to be the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.320 
antagonistic muscle is going to be the
muscle

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
muscle

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.190 
muscle
capable<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.680> opposite<00:01:26.280> motion<00:01:26.729> or

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
capable of doing the opposite motion or

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
capable of doing the opposite motion or
creating<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> opposite<00:01:28.770> motion<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
creating the opposite motion so in this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.399 
creating the opposite motion so in this
case<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.170> triceps<00:01:31.740> brachii<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.259> any

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
case it's the triceps brachii so for any

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
case it's the triceps brachii so for any
given<00:01:34.560> movement<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.729> major<00:01:36.060> muscle

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
given movement you have a major muscle

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
given movement you have a major muscle
involved<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> movement<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.770> that's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
involved with the movement and that's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.550 
involved with the movement and that's
the<00:01:38.460> prime<00:01:38.700> mover<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.020> muscles<00:01:40.470> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the prime mover you have muscles that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
the prime mover you have muscles that
either<00:01:40.860> assist<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.610> movement<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.150> stabilize

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
either assist the movement or stabilize

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
either assist the movement or stabilize
the<00:01:43.140> limb<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> area<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> body<00:01:44.430> those

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.569 
the limb or the area of the body those
are<00:01:45.420> called<00:01:45.659> synergists<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.460> an

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
are called synergists and you have an

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
are called synergists and you have an
antagonistic<00:01:48.180> muscle<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> muscle<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
antagonistic muscle a muscle that is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
antagonistic muscle a muscle that is
capable<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.369> producing<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:51.060> opposite<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.049> the
