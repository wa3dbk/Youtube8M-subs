absolutely

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.340 
absolutely
I<00:04:27.430> think<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.540> great<00:04:28.660> walk-around<00:04:29.199> lens

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
I think it's a great walk-around lens

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.980 
I think it's a great walk-around lens
you<00:04:29.500> have<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:31.060> many<00:04:31.180> zippers<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.690> could<00:04:31.810> put

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
you have so many zippers you could put

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.570 
you have so many zippers you could put
things<00:04:32.139> in<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:32.560> an<00:04:32.650> extremely<00:04:33.070> versatile

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
things in it's an extremely versatile

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.490
