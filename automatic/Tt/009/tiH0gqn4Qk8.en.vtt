housing<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:24.980> tells<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.780> which<00:02:26.780> way<00:02:26.959> to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
housing here that tells you which way to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.540 
housing here that tells you which way to
put<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> batteries<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:27.830> there's<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.340> plus

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
put the batteries in there's the plus

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.090 
put the batteries in there's the plus
side<00:02:28.850> down<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.450> put<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> little<00:02:30.620> for<00:02:30.920> your

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
side down so put a little for your

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.479 
side down so put a little for your
batteries<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:32.530> plus<00:02:33.530> side<00:02:33.830> down

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
batteries in plus side down

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.160 
batteries in plus side down
and<00:02:34.580> then<00:02:35.270> you're<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.569> place<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.870> inside

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and then you're going to place it inside

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.020 
and then you're going to place it inside
the<00:02:36.350> unit<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.220> will<00:02:37.340> charge<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.819> so

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
the unit and you will charge it so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.090 
the unit and you will charge it so
there's<00:02:38.840> my<00:02:39.050> triple-a<00:02:39.500> one<00:02:40.060> you're<00:02:41.060> 32

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
there's my triple-a one you're 32

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
there's my triple-a one you're 32
Triple<00:02:43.100> Aim<00:02:43.250> three<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.260> triple-a<00:02:45.769> four

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
Triple Aim three and triple-a four

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.410 
Triple Aim three and triple-a four
inside<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.260> unit<00:02:49.000> unit<00:02:50.000> goes<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.209> goal

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
inside the unit unit goes and the goal

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.120 
inside the unit unit goes and the goal
inside<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.989> goal<00:02:54.170> zero<00:02:54.200> there's<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.890> little

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
inside the goal zero there's a little

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.210 
inside the goal zero there's a little
plus<00:02:55.370> marks<00:02:55.790> there<00:02:56.030> at<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.269> bottom<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:58.130> can

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
plus marks there at the bottom you can

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.979 
plus marks there at the bottom you can
see<00:02:58.489> them<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.360> that's<00:02:59.480> how<00:02:59.660> you're<00:02:59.840> going<00:02:59.930> to

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
see them so that's how you're going to

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.800 
see them so that's how you're going to
put<00:03:00.200> there's<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.560> negatives<00:03:01.010> at<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.220> top<00:03:01.810> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
put there's the negatives at the top so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.320 
put there's the negatives at the top so
that's<00:03:02.989> exactly<00:03:03.410> how<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:04.160> unit<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.819> going<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that's exactly how this unit is going to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.509 
that's exactly how this unit is going to
go<00:03:05.569> in<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.200> base<00:03:06.410> unit<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> put<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.150> in

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.640 

put<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.640> batteries<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.570> then<00:03:15.260> shut<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
put the batteries in and then shut the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.130 
put the batteries in and then shut the
door<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.230> then<00:03:18.320> hook<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.769> my<00:03:19.690> USB<00:03:20.690> input

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
door and then hook to my USB input

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.030 
door and then hook to my USB input
that's<00:03:21.320> hooked<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.620> my<00:03:21.739> computer<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:24.040> there

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
that's hooked to my computer and there

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.890 
that's hooked to my computer and there
it<00:03:25.130> goes

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
it goes

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.300 
it goes
right<00:03:26.900> now<00:03:27.019> it's<00:03:27.230> near<00:03:27.440> their<00:03:27.650> nearly<00:03:27.890> charged

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
right now it's near their nearly charged

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.520 
right now it's near their nearly charged
when<00:03:28.519> it's<00:03:28.670> blinking<00:03:29.329> green<00:03:29.510> when<00:03:30.410> it's

blinking red they're you know the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.880 
blinking red they're you know the
batteries<00:03:32.900> are<00:03:33.049> lower<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.650> they're<00:03:33.799> gonna

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
batteries are lower and they're gonna

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.060 
batteries are lower and they're gonna
take<00:03:34.130> longer<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:35.180> recharge<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.500> again<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:36.799> just

guys<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.950> goal<00:03:58.130> zero<00:03:58.670> guide<00:03:59.030> 10<00:03:59.329> plus<00:03:59.600> what<00:04:00.320> I

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
guys the goal zero guide 10 plus what I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.809 
guys the goal zero guide 10 plus what I
think<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> great<00:04:02.019> add-on<00:04:03.100> piece<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.340> have<00:04:04.519> is

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
think is a great add-on piece to have is

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.789 
think is a great add-on piece to have is
the<00:04:05.030> triple<00:04:05.299> a<00:04:05.480> power<00:04:05.750> pack<00:04:06.079> so<00:04:06.380> now<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.560> have

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
the triple a power pack so now you have

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.770 
the triple a power pack so now you have
the<00:04:06.890> capability<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.519> double-a<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.150> triple-a

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
the capability of double-a and triple-a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.699 
the capability of double-a and triple-a
recharging<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:10.459> have<00:04:11.709> rechargeable

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709
