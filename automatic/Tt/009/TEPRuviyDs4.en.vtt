to believe that maybe this is it has
moved<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> Google<00:01:37.369> Sky<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.299> go

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
moved if you go to Google Sky now and go

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.880 
moved if you go to Google Sky now and go
to<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.860> coordinates<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.520> give<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.890> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to these next coordinates I give you you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.520 
to these next coordinates I give you you
will<00:01:44.189> find<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.960> exact<00:01:46.409> same

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
will find it and it's the exact same

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
will find it and it's the exact same

spaces between them that's your right
ascension<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.110> I'll<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
ascension and I'll actually do this so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.390 
ascension and I'll actually do this so
you<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.560> right<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
you can see that right there there's a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390 
you can see that right there there's a
right<00:02:47.700> extension<00:02:48.300> those<00:02:49.290> numbers<00:02:49.740> there<00:02:50.010> your

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
right extension those numbers there your

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.750 
right extension those numbers there your
declamation<00:02:51.240> will<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:52.020> 22<00:02:54.170> 4721<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.470> then<00:02:56.220> hit

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
declamation will be 22 4721 and then hit

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.690 
declamation will be 22 4721 and then hit
go<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.690> will<00:03:00.930> find<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.410> object<00:03:01.950> now<00:03:02.370> i'm

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
go and you will find this object now i'm

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
go and you will find this object now i'm
going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.030> show<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.240> my<00:03:03.570> back<00:03:03.840> at<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:07.220> you
