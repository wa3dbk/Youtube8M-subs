 generalist in the segment let's say more 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 this effort in the market and putting 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.230
 the technology that is so important I 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.180
 which is so friendly especially with the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.529
 young audience that many people 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 can choose the models that are 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
 they are applying the so-called median ve 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 totally totally average nothing good 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.739
 as you said you are a technology 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 accessible and applied in the models of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 segment b punctually in sanders or in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.030
 sandero stepway privilege and en duster 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.400
 lux 2.0 both 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 medium 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.770
 is the accessibility for everyone behind 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.010
 a 7-inch touch screen in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.540
 where you have all the applicable multimedia 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.650
 you can play with your phone with your 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.329
 bluetooth through audio streaming 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.460
 you can connect your phone listen to the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.049
 music directly through you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.549
 satellite command that you do not lose it to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.829
 otherwise it's super useful because there 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.820
 you can cut to answer the phone you can 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.920
 play with the satellite command 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 distract you from driving all industrial 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 of handling you can talk to your mother-in-law 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 with your wife in the car's interior 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.870
 The most important thing about this is that you bring 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.930
 gps built into this one 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.570
 ya touch a super friendly gps like 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.460
 whatever ps was out of the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 incorporation of the vehicle although I thought 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.630
 that tells you everything you need 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.080
 points of interest destinations arrivals 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.090
 no traffic and it's a super technology 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.070
 applied the most important thing of this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.620
 surely you are going to ask him but that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.870
 I want to say before that is the price 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.060
 it is a very affordable price a price of 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.820
 thousand 500 pesos in these vehicles that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.860
 they are a leader in the market with this 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.510
 wants to seek leadership in this 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.430
 segment through everything that is 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.170
 the touch screen and another very thing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.400
 important the guarantee accompanies the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.190
 vehicle warranty three years 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960
 also the medium company with something 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.810
 I say with this they are doing a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 difference highly because it is very 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.530
 aggressive the price to a technology 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.240
 really as friendly as juecismo 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 correct I think that is what the 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.690
 mark punctually we are actually 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 looking just as I told you 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.590
 leadership in this segment through 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.380
 all that is touch screens 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.000
 how good you know in the segment 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.560
 everyone has this possibility of having 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 which is incorporated to have the multimedia 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220
 to have bluetooth to have audio 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.870
 streaming 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.070
 helps us look for leadership in the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310
 segment if one speaks in terms 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.890
 commercial I say in the planned volume 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.510
 for you what is annual with this 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.280
 incorporation and as soon as they believe that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.410
 can decide at the sales level a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 percentage so they have like that the idea 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.410
 laws obviously in percentage to follow 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.020
 growing as well we explain you in the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.060
 presentation today in 2012 we made a 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.730
 14.8 percent participation in the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.290
 market the idea of ​​ours 2013 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.090
 in the day to day is to try 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.260
 exceed 15 percent with this 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.520
 new product in this segment 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.050
 We try to give the customer a plus for 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.880
 Good, we just have a 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.380
 higher percentage of participation since 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.670
 this segment towards the totality of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.200
 market tomorrow can be 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.390
 wait as optional for other models 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.459
 I say expanding we are working on 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 we are working to make these 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.970
 can be had in other models in the 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.220

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.050
 model sandero stepway and something 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.060
 very important that I did not tell you Pablo 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.920
 is that duster also incorporates 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 rear parking sensor 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.460
 perfect only a plus of 500 pesos 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.010
 more or you are taking 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.140
 for 1500 and for 500 pesos more you take 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.760
 the sensor station back at work 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.280
 made from the brand that always remains 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.840
 it looks more tidy and looks much better 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.980
 and good as well as we know that it's going to 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.530
 being is a product that is being 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.080
 selling very well this gives a certain 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.610
 push to have a much more vehicle 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.840
 modern fernando I know that out there I do not 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.180
 you can anticipate because they are issues 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.560
 of the brand but this is an intense year 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 especially because they come from 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.970
 automobile what will be the presence of 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.010
 renault in this in this event so 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.040

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.050
 thierry things in the presentation our 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.430

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.030

 stand called the band which is a 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.530
 concept that has many modifications 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.940
 including a small hill there 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.610

 we have in Argentina then the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.670
 expectations for those based on 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.560
 crisis expectations are great 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.960
 They are very good as told by thierry and 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.300
 we also try to overcome 15 per 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.280

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.390
