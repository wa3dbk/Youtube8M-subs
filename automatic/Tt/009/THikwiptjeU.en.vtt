00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 all giuseppe di serves to all boys 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.099
 today we do an unboxing we talk about 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 of the live media portable gamer 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.940
 it is an acquisition card 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 really very very interesting so 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 let's find out together 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 let's start from the box in fact 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.900
 luck is also written Italian 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 so we won't have any major difficulties 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 we can register two modes 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.019
 different the first one in fact and through 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.880
 computer use but there is also the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.099
 pc free mode so you can 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.810
 record your games even without 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 the use of the computer therefore if ad 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.899
 example you are at a friend's house and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 you want to do everything so much more 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.829
 hurry you won't have big problems in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.050
 In this case, however, you will need to use one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 sd card of class 10 to record the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.680
 your games then we'll see obviously 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 housing these cards and all the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 then there is written that there is also 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 the acquisition of play the 1080p at 60 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 I believe that 60 refers to and 60 fps 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 but now it's enough to lose ourselves in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 chatter and let's go and unwrap it together 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 the card obviously I have already discarded 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 all I tried the card to give you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.460
 obviously a little more information 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 precise and this is what you see here 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 really very very small indeed me 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.939
 I waited a little bigger at first 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 and as you can see this is the palm 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.110
 of my hand you can maybe wear it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.790
 where you want by putting it also in your pocket 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.290
 even if at your own risk and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 danger, however, apart from these 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 nonsense and here we have several 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.310
 in fact we have the hdmi in out 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.610
 then we see the entrance and exit 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.710
 for the audio and then labin we see a little 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.470
 which others are the revenue here you can 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.869
 just insert your sd cards 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 on the other hand there is the revenue 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.430
 to connect the mini usb cable to the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.439
 computer and then here you can find it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.570
 switch in such a way as to decide which one it is 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.040
 your registration mode 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.659
 preferred so if you want to record 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.409
 via computer or without 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.909
 computer 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.100
 in the end certainly not for importance 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.170
 indeed perhaps the most important part is who 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 we know we have the key that allows us 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 to start or stop ours 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.979
 registrations we mature the housing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.479
 that allowed us to keep the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.860
 our acquisition card there 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.229
 we find something in front of us 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 interesting or a subscription of 3 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.850
 months on the right split that if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.350
 should be a 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 drama that will allow us to do 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.459
 streaming on twitter agazzi sooner or later 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.170
 streaming will come on tweets 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.970
 don't worry about the live gamer 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.709
 portable supports this 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.450
 then function via this tab 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.760
 acquisition you can also do 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.440
 streaming anyway here I was discarding 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.480
 all and we also have some 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.400
 manuals that never hurts cable 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.989
 everything falls as I said this and hand 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 bed of instructions that will allow you to 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.000
 understand how to connect the live of 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.370
 in fact, you can portable to every console 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.770
 register via langer portable since 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.010
 playstation 4 xbox juan and also on 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.480
 yellow however xbox 360 and playstation 3 here 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.730
 then we also have a project there 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.410
 indicates where to download the program 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.959
 will allow us to record from computer 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.010
 which by the way is called roy central o 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.530
 medium rec 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.330
 enter the central king so I think yes yes 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.280
 pronounce it as I just said 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.080
 and it's a very, very long program 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 valid within this package 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.190
 there are all cables really no 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.200
 time brothel to put them all back a 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.209
 place since as I told you earlier 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.950
 I had already used the live gamer 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.930
 portable course to test its 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.310
 quality and so we keep it out there 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.320
 the first place we have a small one 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.820
 case that allows us to put 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.650
 that live inside the Hummer door 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.690
 wanting that I really find it something 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 fantastic because i don't know i like them 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.230
 these little cazzatine these 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.120
 accessories among other things is a fabric also 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.530
 very particular not only here 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.630
 sorry that you can't touch it but 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 really very soft enough bullshit 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.170
 so let's fix our live 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.720
 by door it means that there is 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.359
 perfectly no we see a little bit yes 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.760
 really very thread and then we are here 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.950
 the hdmi cable that obviously I already had 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.079
 discarded to test and it is rather 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.480
 small indeed indeed in the event that 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.700
 however started live gamer port that 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.650
 near the console or at 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.450
 device from which you want to record 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.459
 it shouldn't be a big deal 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.829
 then we also have another wide range 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.510
 of cables and similar things such as this 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.160
 it should be for audio 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.109
 then we have this here that allows us 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.819
 to record from playstation 3 others 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.010
 connectors of which I honestly do not know 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.510
 what to make me sure they will be very useful for 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.709
 do something but not at the moment 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.660
 still used 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.660
 and then we also have this mini usb 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.410
 cable that allows us to connect to the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.989
 computer 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.310
 the live gamer portable 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.079
 he said this at the beginning of the video 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.389
 really very interesting card because 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.220
 you can register in two different ways 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.590
 so in the case where for example you are 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.479
 at a friend's house and you don't want to take you 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.240
 too much brothel below 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.889
 just use a sd e card 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.539
 therefore you will solve the problem 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.400
 I personally believe that you will really be 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.960
 very useful because in case the 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.639
 future there will be possibility to do of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.530
 i travel something like i need 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.569
 of a position card I believe the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.160
 my choice will fall precisely on this in 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.319
 description you will find a link to 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.360
 watch a video recorded via the 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.280
 Live gamer portable obviously not 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.530
 modified so it will be a pure video 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.360
 registered without any modification of 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.340
 in case you are interested in buying it vi 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.919
 I will leave the link to at noon description 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.590
 I think the price is around 130 euros 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.360
 obviously it depends on the store from which 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.099
 you will buy it however more or less we are up 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.020
 that figure more thank me for giving me 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.460
 for sending me this product and vi 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.840
 remember to leave a nice like and 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.380
 subscribe to the channel if you have n't yet 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.120
 done 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.870
 so guys I greet you and to 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.870
