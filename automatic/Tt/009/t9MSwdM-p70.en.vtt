did have to replace this CRT wire here
would<00:02:38.060> some<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.750> 30,000<00:02:39.650> bolt<00:02:39.830> wire<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
would some of that 30,000 bolt wire a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.760 
would some of that 30,000 bolt wire a
head<00:02:40.460> metal<00:02:41.270> hard<00:02:41.540> brittle<00:02:41.780> stuff<00:02:42.140> broke<00:02:42.470> and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
head metal hard brittle stuff broke and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260 
head metal hard brittle stuff broke and
there<00:02:43.010> was<00:02:43.130> back<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.520> drawing<00:02:43.760> board<00:02:44.120> and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
there was back to the drawing board and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.480 
there was back to the drawing board and
more<00:02:44.480> wire<00:02:44.720> replacements<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.830> think<00:02:46.220> I've

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
more wire replacements so I think I've

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.760 
more wire replacements so I think I've
got<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.820> all<00:02:46.940> taken<00:02:47.150> care<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.630> let's<00:02:48.500> take<00:02:48.709> a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
and that stiffened it up made it nice

solid<00:03:44.570> all<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.720> way<00:03:44.780> around<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.680> isn't

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
solid all the way around this isn't

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.250 
solid all the way around this isn't
exactly<00:03:46.250> bent<00:03:47.000> back<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.570> way<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.870> was<00:03:48.050> but

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
exactly bent back to the way it was but

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.690 
exactly bent back to the way it was but
I<00:03:48.350> didn't<00:03:48.560> want<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.740> take<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.070> entire<00:03:49.190> thing

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I didn't want to take the entire thing

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.940 
I didn't want to take the entire thing
off<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.090> redo<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:51.140> I<00:03:51.260> bent<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> down<00:03:51.680> as

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
off and redo it but I bent it down as

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.860 
off and redo it but I bent it down as
best<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.310> could<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.760> used<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.150> epoxy<00:03:53.450> gel

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
best I could and I used that epoxy gel

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.420 
best I could and I used that epoxy gel
underneath<00:03:54.350> there<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> five-minute<00:03:55.400> epoxy

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
underneath there that five-minute epoxy

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.060 
underneath there that five-minute epoxy
and<00:03:56.420> glued<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.989> down<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.560> she's<00:03:57.830> nice<00:03:58.040> and

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
and glued that down so she's nice and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.030 
and glued that down so she's nice and
solid<00:03:58.430> right<00:03:58.760> now<00:03:58.910> everything<00:03:59.830> got<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.860> nice

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
solid right now everything got a nice

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.710 
solid right now everything got a nice
shape<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.550> -<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:01.970> almost<00:04:02.090> back<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.480> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
shape to it - it's almost back to the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720 
shape to it - it's almost back to the
way<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.870> was<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:04.190> taking<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.550> lot<00:04:04.670> of

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
way it was but it's taking a lot of

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.190 
way it was but it's taking a lot of
damage<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.330> lot<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.480> hits<00:04:05.690> over<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.050> years

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200
