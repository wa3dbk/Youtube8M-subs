00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.450
 with this recipe we are going to need some 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.099
 chicken breasts can be the breast 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.849
 full or half I had these 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.640
 filleted and the pieces in pieces in 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.430
 small bites and the essonne with salt and 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.230
 freshly ground black pepper because it tastes 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.860
 freshly ground better than when 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.220
 We also take everything out of a boat around here 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.060
 tomato 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.700
 some garlic cloves chopped oil 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.230
 We will need olive and I have 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.570
 margarine can also use 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.770
 butter we're going to need half 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 bar and pasta and the ingredient 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 invited for this recipe is going to be the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.970
 basil I'm going to cut it here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.560
 is my soul here 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.560
 and cool I have 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.350
 what will it be and I took the opportunity to teach 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.750
 our habanero plant that has already 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 given about 20 chilies 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.040
 this is lemons are this color 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.660
 but tastes the same as lemon 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.660
 this is a rosebush 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.230
 this one that's around here is like tomatoes 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.620
 that soon we will have tomatoes this 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.160
 small here is the band is 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.160
 starting to grow 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 and over there I have another pot where 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.149
 already back to the kitchen here I have my 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.760
 basil clean fresh and ready to be 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.940
 chopped 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.100
 this is an aromatic herb I think that 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.280
 is my favorite has an aroma 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.080
 delicious sweet and serves for many 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.530
 stuff serves for coughing to lower the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.090
 temperature for the calculations is very 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.150
 good then this is our 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.780
 star ingredient for this recipe from 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.930
 chicken with tomato and basil we put the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.560
 olive oil 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 to be 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.620
 we add the tomato 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.050
 and chopped basil 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.840
 Now we are going to add half a bar of 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.840
 butter or margarine 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.750
 this is going to be that the consistency remains 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.170
 more creamy 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.120
 more body not so liquid we are going to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.120
 stir well to melt 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.629
 and in the dram 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.620
 so is our chicken left if you want 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.660
 you can add more salt and pepper for 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.209
 finish seasoning it already when the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.300
 chicken is well cooked and our sauce 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.030
 begins to bubble, we will leave it in 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.290
 slow fire and now we're going to prepare 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.560
 complete the saucer 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.579
 the spaghetti and on top we're going to put 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.579
 our chicken 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.299
 a good amount of chicken 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.490
 more 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.410
 garnish with the basil leaves and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.410
