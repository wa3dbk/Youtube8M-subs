there's one blemish right here on the
driver's<00:02:42.450> side<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.170> was<00:02:43.320> from

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
driver's side I think that was from

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.430 
driver's side I think that was from
somebody<00:02:43.770> touching<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.520> up<00:02:45.170> moving<00:02:46.170> from<00:02:46.320> a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
somebody touching it up moving from a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.250 
somebody touching it up moving from a
steep<00:02:46.740> t-strap<00:02:50.450> also<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> hood<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:54.330> dirty<00:02:54.780> but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
steep t-strap also the hood is dirty but

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.970 
steep t-strap also the hood is dirty but
it's<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.130> shape<00:02:56.190> too<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.940> also<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> top

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
it's in good shape too and also the top

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.500 
it's in good shape too and also the top
just<00:02:58.980> needs<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.459> waxed<00:02:59.700> pretty<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.360> I

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
just needs to be waxed pretty much I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:15.530 
just needs to be waxed pretty much I
might<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:01.050> bit<00:03:14.239> what<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.360> owner

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
might have a little bit what the owner

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.610 
might have a little bit what the owner
said<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.290> they<00:03:16.440> had<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.800> import<00:03:18.620> engine

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
said is that they had an import engine

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.400 
said is that they had an import engine
put<00:03:19.800> in<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.070> from<00:03:20.730> chin<00:03:21.060> Dawa<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.720> think<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.200> had

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
put in it from chin Dawa I think it had

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.530 
put in it from chin Dawa I think it had
approximately<00:03:22.860> forty<00:03:23.580> five<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.060> fifty<00:03:24.209> five

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
approximately forty five to fifty five

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.320 
approximately forty five to fifty five
thousand<00:03:24.959> miles<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.030> they<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.180> this

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
thousand miles on it and they have this

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.360 
thousand miles on it and they have this
done<00:03:27.600> probably<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:28.140> five<00:03:28.980> or<00:03:29.130> six<00:03:29.220> years

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
done probably about five or six years

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.090 
done probably about five or six years
ago<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:29.970> probably<00:03:30.180> has<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:31.020> good<00:03:31.800> hundred

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
ago so it probably has a good hundred

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.960 
ago so it probably has a good hundred
thousand<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:33.650> notice<00:03:34.650> over<00:03:35.370> here<00:03:37.790> there's<00:03:38.790> a
