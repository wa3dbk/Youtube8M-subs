00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.660
 let's go let's move out of 15 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.030
 place to first it will be peculiar 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.010

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.480
 Fifteenth place so on 15 place on 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:32.430
 here's a secret here we do the usual 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 snowman here and in 15th place with us 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.080
 such is the secret that if we are 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 dig a snow under the snowman 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.890
 the snow will not fade and we will dig 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 endlessly here to you and the first snow and so 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.010
 let's get to the fourteenth place at 14 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.470
 our place is such a secret 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.320
 principle minecraft players can 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.690
 also use as fuel but 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 agree it is a very expensive fuel 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 because it spends one diamond and 8 boards 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.220
 something 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.759
 melt down this knife is very very expensive 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.700
 and so on the 13th place we have here such 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.590
 the secret of one block of water we can 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.609
 take an infinite amount of water in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.859
 our bubbles 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:21.929
 vodka here is a strange logic in our 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:23.999
 minecraft and twelfth place sorry 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.579
 here we have such a secret that 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.039
 if the dog is sitting on the chest then we 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.609
 can we open and is there a cat sitting on 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.979
 we can not open it to the chest 11 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.689
 the secret is that bows we 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.079
 we can shoot down trolleys 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.219
 or boats here so interesting secret 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.859
 isn't it true the 10 secret we have is so 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.869
 take everything we need all of you 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.149
 have seen me with monsters 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.149
 but in principle, many do not know what they are 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.189
 are here now if we break one 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.789
 stone with monsters falls out 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.720
 well damn one or two 2 scale 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.880
 and this is ben 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.460
 generally disgustingly nasty thing very rare 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 movie thing no they so need to guess what 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's a kapets simple and by the way many such 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.000
 many of these stones were noticed near the portal 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.550
 in andy ruby ender world 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 sorry but i will tell you that these here 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.470
 stones to not generated and in the ordinary world 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.320
 yes and you can meet them there but they are in 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 the ordinary world is generated from well very 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.959
 rarely very and very carriage and so 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.270
 ninth place ninth place us so 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.620
 the secret that we are using screams can you 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.780
 yourself on the spawn of the little inhabitants yes here 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.840
 so by the way what is the skin in 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.730
 large residents does not affect generation 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.930
 Here are these little people here and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.260
 Of course with them we can not trade 8 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.400
 secret and 8 secret is that 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.130
 with mushroom 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.239
 or mushroom cow we we can calm 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.380
 take a bowl and remove the mushroom soup 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.800
 yes here is such an interesting secret 7 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.230
 we have such a secret so take all that to us 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:21.090
 no, you need to remember the zombies on children 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.340
 far here and if we shoot at 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.880
 by zombies and an arrow released from our 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.220
 onions will fly through slavuta 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.220
 zombies will still be dealt fire damage 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:43.760
 what now in 5 via wants me 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.760
 oh well, that doesnâ€™t plow damn well again 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.709
 but something is not working but in principle 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.879
 it should all work yes so here 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:00.299
 Well 6 tank but that is the secret of 6 and all 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.180
 we know that our sand shower slows down but 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.030
 so here it slows down but few 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.790
 knows what is there to sign a shower to put 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.310
 ice then it will slow down even more 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.500
 see how much he slows down here and 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.019
 here you can run why here 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.870
 red torches is another small 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.060
 secret red torches is the only 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.479
 light source in my opinion under which not 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.780
 ice seems to be melting 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.360
 sort of like the fifth secret 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.180
 fifth secret fifth secret is 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.060
 that we look at ourselves 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.220
 impose poisoning effect and few 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.169
 knows that milk removes all bad 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.199
 effects and look we kicked it out 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.139
 and all the all the bad effects of it have disappeared 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.240
 very good secret and help in new 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.070
 versions where they added garden of and they 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.340
 give effect and on him and slow down here 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.560
 this is a very very good secret and so 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.830
 fourth place let's see what we have 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.120
 here so take all the necessary and so 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:07.139
 this secret is that if 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:13.169
 we have a pig and a cow 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:17.340
 they will not be affected by this 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.820
 roast meat here and roast pork here 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.810
 for such a fun and sekretik 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.680
 help in principle to create 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:30.390
 any automatic farms meat fuh 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.690
 well, the third secret bronze went so 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:38.330
 I read somewhere in the earlier versions of 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:42.960
 my earlier versions if you like 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.000
 wool scissors cut that strength 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.060
 no scissors spent yes and that 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.460
 indeed so on version 1 7 and 9 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.140
 This, too, so I look in mode 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.000
 Survival scissors cut wool and 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.340
 their strength does not decrease this 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.160
 pretty cool secret can it and 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.580
 tank but it will even serve secrets and 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.230
 very useful well then let's go further 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:12.990
 so second place silver went so 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.650
 this secret is such here if we put 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.000
 ice 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:21.930
 here again , the same red torches set 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.670
 water to flow somewhere and if we are on 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.300
 this design throw any 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.240
 thing 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.360
 he will sail at an incredible speed 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.260
 see how quickly our diamond hit 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.200
 very quickly look again like this 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.820
 here look how fast everything floats again 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.250
 did this secret serve for 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.080
 create any automatic farms 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.710
 or just some interesting 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.360
 mechanisms well then the last first 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.710
 secret yes sounds strange of course 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.400
 last first secret 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:56.430
 and first place of all the secrets we have 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.460
 takes here is such a secret went 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.800
 This secret I showed in one and my 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.460
 videos and their videos about redstone 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.280
 mechanism 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:10.880
 here if we call the jab tag here 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.700
 and bottom slash is not necessarily bottom slash 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.770
 Well, in principle, called the tag only 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.520
 in order for the sheep 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:22.190
 call the jab and forward slash and watch the sheep 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.919
 shimmers with all the colors that are 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.440
 minecraft is a very cool secret and 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.120
 works in survival mode but how 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.000

 make all the sheep like that 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.270
