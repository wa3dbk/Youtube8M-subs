a look into the future black could play
h3<00:02:04.070> but<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.250> night<00:02:05.490> g3<00:02:06.180> check<00:02:06.540> king<00:02:07.110> h4<00:02:07.740> night

h3 but then night g3 check king h4 night

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.760 
h3 but then night g3 check king h4 night
e<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.759> h<00:02:09.020> 2<00:02:10.020> nite<00:02:10.920> f3<00:02:11.610> check<00:02:12.000> king<00:02:12.569> h3<00:02:13.260> night

6h<00:02:14.100> two<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.850> enough<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.990> draw<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> he<00:02:18.360> actually

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
6h two is enough to draw so he actually

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
6h two is enough to draw so he actually
has<00:02:19.290> two<00:02:19.590> queen<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.290> white<00:02:22.830> has<00:02:23.190> the

defense Knight takes h4 and black has
nothing<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.690> prevent<00:02:31.110> white<00:02:31.470> from<00:02:32.070> building<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
nothing to prevent white from building a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
nothing to prevent white from building a
fortress<00:02:33.120> by<00:02:33.510> night<00:02:34.020> h<00:02:34.320> 2<00:02:34.800> f<00:02:34.980> 3<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:36.510> he<00:02:37.410> wants<00:02:37.740> to

example the Queen h1 check night h 2 f 3

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.340 
example the Queen h1 check night h 2 f 3
and<00:02:47.340> black<00:02:48.240> king<00:02:48.600> can't<00:02:49.080> escape<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:51.350> course

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
and black king can't escape of course

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.330 
and black king can't escape of course
there<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.830> no<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.460> way<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:54.740> King<00:02:55.740> chief<00:02:56.100> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
there is no other way like King chief I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.150 
there is no other way like King chief I
for<00:02:56.820> King<00:02:57.240> takes<00:02:57.450> each<00:02:57.720> person's<00:02:58.320> Knight<00:02:58.830> f3

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
for King takes each person's Knight f3

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.360 
for King takes each person's Knight f3
check<00:02:59.900> we<00:03:00.900> win<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> Queen<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.740> is<00:03:04.950> the

check we win the Queen so this is the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.120 
check we win the Queen so this is the
whole<00:03:05.760> solution<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.440> what<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.830> very

whole solution and to what it's very

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.920 
whole solution and to what it's very
short<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.970> also<00:03:09.210> very<00:03:09.630> difficult<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> find
