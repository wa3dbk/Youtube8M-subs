know<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.640> when<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.870> bit

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
know that when you have a little bit

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.190 
know that when you have a little bit
more<00:00:46.289> air<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.160> little<00:00:47.399> bit<00:00:47.600> bigger<00:00:48.600> mass<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
more air and a little bit bigger mass of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
more air and a little bit bigger mass of
body<00:00:49.440> parts<00:00:49.800> together<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.520> easier<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> heat

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
body parts together it's easier to heat

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260 
body parts together it's easier to heat
that<00:00:51.510> space<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.399> lobster<00:00:53.940> design

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that space so using the lobster design

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.610 
that space so using the lobster design
here<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.660> grouping<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> fingers<00:00:55.440> together

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
here by grouping the fingers together

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
here by grouping the fingers together
you<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> better<00:00:56.850> chance<00:00:57.300> at

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you actually have a better chance at

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
you actually have a better chance at
keeping<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.050> fingers<00:00:58.379> warmer<00:00:58.739> than<00:00:59.070> an

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
keeping your fingers warmer than an

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.729 
keeping your fingers warmer than an
individually<00:00:59.969> insulated<00:01:00.570> Fivefinger<00:01:01.410> glove

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
individually insulated Fivefinger glove

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
individually insulated Fivefinger glove
so<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.520> around<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.879> 140<00:01:03.510> dollar

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so we're right around that 140 dollar

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
so we're right around that 140 dollar
mark<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> Ruka<00:01:04.710> lobster<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.339> is
