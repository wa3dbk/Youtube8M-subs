hello<00:00:01.530> there<00:00:01.909> in<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.510> I'm<00:00:03.780> gonna<00:00:03.929> show

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hello there in this video I'm gonna show

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.460 
hello there in this video I'm gonna show
you<00:00:04.259> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.970> develop<00:00:05.970> an<00:00:06.480> application<00:00:06.690> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
you how to develop an application that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.620 
you how to develop an application that
looks<00:00:07.710> very<00:00:07.919> much<00:00:08.099> like<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.460> Twitter<00:00:08.820> iPad<00:00:09.450> app

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
looks very much like a Twitter iPad app

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.039 
looks very much like a Twitter iPad app
with<00:00:10.349> scrolling<00:00:11.309> views<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.480> an

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
with scrolling views so this is an

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.600 
with scrolling views so this is an
example<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> app<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.340> we're<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
example of the app that we're going to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.910 
example of the app that we're going to
develop<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.389> series<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.809> videos<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.379> we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
develop in this series of videos so we

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.250 
develop in this series of videos so we
have<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> list<00:00:17.400> down<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:18.810> choosing

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
have a list down here and then choosing

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830 
have a list down here and then choosing
any<00:00:19.650> element<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> list<00:00:20.640> will<00:00:21.270> actually

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
any element in the list will actually

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.950 
any element in the list will actually
show<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.350> new<00:00:22.529> list<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> site<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.060> then

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
show up a new list on the site and then

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.290 
show up a new list on the site and then
choosing<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.740> element<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.730> list<00:00:26.789> will

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
choosing that element in this list will

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.150 
choosing that element in this list will
not<00:00:27.449> give<00:00:27.630> us<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:27.900> our<00:00:28.080> detailed<00:00:28.470> view<00:00:28.710> with

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
not give us like our detailed view with

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.150 
not give us like our detailed view with
some<00:00:29.789> pictures<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
some pictures so this is gonna be like a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.470 
some pictures so this is gonna be like a
picture<00:00:32.160> book<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> photo<00:00:33.239> book

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
picture book like a photo book

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.260 
picture book like a photo book
application<00:00:33.750> where<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.730> series

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
application where you can have a series

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.250 
application where you can have a series
of<00:00:36.329> images<00:00:36.800> depending<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> titles<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
of images depending on the titles on the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410 
of images depending on the titles on the
side<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.129> example<00:00:41.520> people<00:00:42.149> who<00:00:42.239> have

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
side here so for example people who have

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.139 
side here so for example people who have
a<00:00:42.450> different<00:00:43.200> photos<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.489> arriving<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a different photos for arriving at the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.600 
a different photos for arriving at the
hotel<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.170> their<00:00:46.320> holiday<00:00:46.620> holidays<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
hotel in on their holiday holidays the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600 
hotel in on their holiday holidays the
trip<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> holiday<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> way<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
trip to the holiday on the way back and

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
trip to the holiday on the way back and
if<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> happen<00:00:51.539> during<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> holidays

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
if that's to happen during the holidays

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.880 
if that's to happen during the holidays
so<00:00:53.120> think<00:00:54.120> that's<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> intro

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so think that's about it for the intro

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
so think that's about it for the intro
let's<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.340> started<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
let's get started so the first thing you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.279 
let's get started so the first thing you
need<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:59.270> to<00:01:00.270> download<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.750> open<00:01:01.050> source

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
need to do is to download an open source

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
need to do is to download an open source
library<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.399> gonna<00:01:02.489> use<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
library that we're gonna use for this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
library that we're gonna use for this
application<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
application and to do that if you go to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.830 
application and to do that if you go to
github<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.150> address<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.270> github<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
github to this address on github is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.429 
github to this address on github is
called<00:01:10.080> stack<00:01:10.409> scroll<00:01:10.920> view<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.930> guys<00:01:13.170> at

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
called stack scroll view and the guys at

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
called stack scroll view and the guys at
raw<00:01:13.710> engineering<00:01:13.979> they've<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.760> done<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
raw engineering they've actually done a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.800 
raw engineering they've actually done a
really<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.740> good<00:01:17.100> job<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.810> giving

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really really really good job of giving

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
really really really good job of giving
us<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> place<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
us like a place to start so if you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.310 
us like a place to start so if you
download<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> source<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.080> source

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
download the the source the source

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
download the the source the source
project<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:25.950> click<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> zip<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
project from here click on the zip you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
project from here click on the zip you
will<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.009> will<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.549> project

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
will get like you will get a project

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
will get like you will get a project
that<00:01:30.090> looks<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.509> similar<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that looks very similar to this one so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.719 
that looks very similar to this one so
let's<00:01:31.650> try<00:01:31.799> running<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.579> we'll

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
let's try running this and then we'll

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.210 
let's try running this and then we'll
see<00:01:32.939> our<00:01:33.210> baseline<00:01:33.869> where<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> start<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
see our baseline where we start from and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
see our baseline where we start from and
then<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:35.880> ahead<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.329> customize<00:01:36.799> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
then we can go ahead and customize the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
then we can go ahead and customize the
application<00:01:38.280> let's<00:01:39.030> stop<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> simulator<00:01:39.720> for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
application let's stop the simulator for

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740 
application let's stop the simulator for
a<00:01:40.020> while<00:01:40.909> when<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.000> download<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> source

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
a while when you download the source

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
a while when you download the source
code<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> where<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> get

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
code this is where you get you get

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.789 
code this is where you get you get
basically<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.750> many<00:01:45.750> wonders<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> left

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
