Snapdragon demo room showing off the
latest<00:00:07.350> on<00:00:07.649> Snapdragon<00:00:08.490> 805<00:00:08.990> this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.200> our

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
latest on Snapdragon 805 this is our

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.580 
latest on Snapdragon 805 this is our
develop<00:00:10.740> platform<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:11.910> 805<00:00:12.599> built-in<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
develop platform with 805 built-in and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890 
develop platform with 805 built-in and
so<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.370> excited<00:00:14.730> about<00:00:14.820> its<00:00:15.150> capabilities

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so really excited about its capabilities

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.349 
so really excited about its capabilities
and<00:00:16.139> how<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.800> has<00:00:17.250> specifically<00:00:17.789> related<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
and how it has specifically related to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.290 
and how it has specifically related to
video<00:00:18.510> support<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.350> hevc<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.220> hardware<00:00:20.730> so

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
video support for hevc in hardware so

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630 
video support for hevc in hardware so
much<00:00:21.480> better<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:22.080> battery<00:00:22.439> life<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.010> user

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
much better with battery life and user

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.810 
much better with battery life and user
experience<00:00:24.470> also<00:00:25.470> has<00:00:25.800> alta<00:00:26.070> HD<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.699> you'll

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
experience also has alta HD so you'll

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.570 
experience also has alta HD so you'll
see<00:00:27.000> playback<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.570> ultra<00:00:27.840> HD<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.340> course

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
see playback in ultra HD and of course

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
see playback in ultra HD and of course
Hollywood<00:00:29.970> quality<00:00:30.330> video<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.990> those

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
Hollywood quality video so all those

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
Hollywood quality video so all those
things<00:00:31.529> combined<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.189> give<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> much

actually be able to see the level of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
actually be able to see the level of
detail<00:00:40.100> which<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> wouldn't<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.670> able<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> see

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
detail which you wouldn't be able to see

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.380 
detail which you wouldn't be able to see
in<00:00:42.420> Full<00:00:42.750> HD<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> Sun<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:45.030> above

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
in Full HD you can see the Sun up above

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.709 
in Full HD you can see the Sun up above
is<00:00:45.629> coming<00:00:46.110> over<00:00:46.579> here<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> hair

is coming over here you can see the hair
on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> Buffalo<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.620> looking<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
on the Buffalo and looking at that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
on the Buffalo and looking at that
detail<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.480> through<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
detail and as we go through this the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
detail and as we go through this the
other<00:00:55.079> big<00:00:55.410> value<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.100> ultra<00:00:56.730> HD<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.210> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
other big value of ultra HD is you can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
other big value of ultra HD is you can
be<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> lot<00:00:57.690> closer<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> screen<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
be a lot closer to the screen so you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.319 
be a lot closer to the screen so you
don't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> worry<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> distance

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
don't have to worry about that distance

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.009 
don't have to worry about that distance
and<00:01:00.809> looking<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.199> pixels<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> look<00:01:03.390> closely<00:01:03.660> at

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and looking at pixels so look closely at

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
and looking at pixels so look closely at
the<00:01:04.110> flowers<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> level<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> detail

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the flowers and the level of the detail

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.679 
the flowers and the level of the detail
and<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> flowers<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:11.240> again<00:01:12.240> what's<00:01:12.450> special

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
and the flowers and again what's special

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
and the flowers and again what's special
is<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.650> can't<00:01:13.890> tell<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is this is you can't tell but this is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
is this is you can't tell but this is
running<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.000> hevc<00:01:15.689> which<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.710> wouldn't<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
running an hevc which you wouldn't and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
running an hevc which you wouldn't and
shouldn't<00:01:17.460> care<00:01:17.820> other<00:01:18.060> than<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.450> care<00:01:18.659> about

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
shouldn't care other than you care about

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.100 
shouldn't care other than you care about
getting<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.650> content<00:01:20.580> faster<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> getting

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
getting your content faster and getting

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
getting your content faster and getting
it<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.439> cost<00:01:22.680> effective<00:01:23.100> price<00:01:23.280> point<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it a more cost effective price point and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
it a more cost effective price point and
of<00:01:24.000> course<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.509> visual<00:01:24.869> differences

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
of course there are visual differences

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.429 
of course there are visual differences
which<00:01:25.920> make<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.159> better<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.869> add<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.320> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
which make it better and add in to that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
which make it better and add in to that
holiday<00:01:28.860> Hollywood<00:01:29.759> quality<00:01:30.210> video<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.509> can

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
holiday Hollywood quality video I can

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
holiday Hollywood quality video I can
see<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> well<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.100> getting

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
see that well and then you're getting

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
see that well and then you're getting
even<00:01:32.610> better<00:01:32.759> experience<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
even better experience so this is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.569 
even better experience so this is
another<00:01:34.619> good<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:34.920> where<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.430> really

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
another good one where you can really

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.179 
another good one where you can really
see<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> purple<00:01:36.420> flowers<00:01:36.900> relative<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> hot

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
see the purple flowers relative the hot

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.000 
see the purple flowers relative the hot
pink

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.680 

so<00:01:46.010> really<00:01:46.400> we're<00:01:46.700> first<00:01:46.940> in<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> industry<00:01:47.570> to

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
so really we're first in the industry to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.649 
so really we're first in the industry to
be<00:01:47.720> able<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:48.050> support<00:01:48.140> ultra-hd<00:01:48.880> from<00:01:49.880> end<00:01:50.180> and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
be able to support ultra-hd from end and

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.210 
be able to support ultra-hd from end and
from<00:01:50.900> capture<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.440> play<00:01:51.620> back<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.979> even

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
from capture to play back to even

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.719 
from capture to play back to even
displays<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.030> think<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.930> ultra<00:01:54.350> HD<00:01:54.710> Plus<00:01:55.010> hevc

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
displays and think of ultra HD Plus hevc

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.820 
displays and think of ultra HD Plus hevc
plus<00:01:56.060> h<00:01:56.270> QV<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.960> all<00:01:57.080> these<00:01:57.290> great<00:01:57.590> features

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
plus h QV and all these great features

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.370 
plus h QV and all these great features
