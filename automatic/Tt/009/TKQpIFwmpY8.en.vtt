00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 no accident prime minister tractor woman 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.370
 a tree has come to man and tries 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.519
 Kim will get their asses attached but honestly 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.059
 saying nothing comes out and written 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:11.689
 what 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.329
 I have my skills 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.679
 In general, anyway, you can switch 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.329
 between all these technical 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.970
 means for example speech excluded tractor 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.890
 which rides special 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.439
 and now explain to me for this and why 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.570
 made this game really exist 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.359
 people who love so much and 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.419
 Vesnina ul ready 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.599
 hack her in a computer game and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.370
 don't even hack a tractor driver 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.149
 type of crack 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.309
 so I absolutely can not understand who and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.309
 why even make the game look at 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.260
 creators 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 and see here it says that one of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.060
 The main ideologues of this game around the day he 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.940
 ian then everything is clear 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 Mandar Uus Ekayan 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.570
 from sharks 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 and south and over it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.880
 famous dutch 21 years and 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.810
 release instructions 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.440
 this game is called not only 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 plant cjsc 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.210
 and unofficially silent 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.810
 independent so we can rate it 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.859
 phantasmagorical case sogda 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.700
 German to German represents 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 asian stocks 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.229
 and no longer compatible, I'm just not 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.030
 imagine nature in obey 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.610
 economy from the arm and the skirts and was her 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.920
 control 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.930
 in the first division set Kazan 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 it's just a barrier I already feel that the game 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.710
 long ago began to change business because 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.260
 what have never played in a group 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.990
 and in the name of which the development of urban 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.130
 the forest is that the water was at least 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.170
 a little head control 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 auto giant intends until the power of the radio and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920
 bloody because of employment and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.979
 I don't remember how this place is, but they 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.130
 they were all just the disgusting 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.230
 totally wild quality 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.350
 and as we see from the picture which 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.200
 appeared on our screen 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 There are also advantages unlikely to become an exception 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.229
 so nice to hear native speech 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160
 a computer game that came out somewhere 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.880
 Apparently in Germany, apparently 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.010
 unity that infuriates me most 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.889
 shooters 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.369
 and in general most of the games are 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.239
 completely wild connection i don't know whole 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.169
 apparently 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.579
 the creators of these games have never played 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.459
 contra strike or other games where necessary 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.100
 Aims purposely because 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.720
 we idiot understand that the faster uteya 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.310
 it is more difficult to adjust the mouse census 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.010
 the game because it will be harder to aim 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.170
 In general, the camera will defend the rights 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.799
 refuse here 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.839
 and I will win plots and 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.930
 computer game as I understand it two 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230
 Chinese citizens are boorish 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.079
 later 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.119
 Russian closing Cherkizovsky market 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.709
 or something like that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.980
 in fact, of course, I joked an hour 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.290
 but the plot 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.369
 not too different 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.509
 Rotan and Polish Mafia as far as I am 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.499
 understood to oppose Russian 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.409
 why do we supply with strict Chinese then 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.169
 there are Japanese 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.439
 so free 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.119
 2 I can not explain it as I can not 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.269
 explain why my character who 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.040
 were almost all and died falling from three meters 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.119
 heights 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.189
 and I still can not explain why we 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.869
 see the face of our characters if 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.810
 approach the emphasis goddaughter while he 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.399
 pens so top fake bud bunny 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.809
 explain to me 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.649
 but if you can email me 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.639
 please we were because it does not give 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.239
 I rest like that to my hands 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.219
 lost weapons 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.389
 and after these manipulations 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.999
 well now i have to 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:33.820
 fistic 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.160
 According to him I wanted to say that the theater but 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.399
 on the poster the mermaid got 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:39.919
 where did you run 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.410
 before heard 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.580
 where to look really salting apparently too 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.450
 watched in childhood lipovsky 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.650
 Somali government 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.689
 See the way from the court with a profit here 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.909
 really anyone would have crashed on him 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.199
 in this situation, all uneasy character 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.419
 somewhere running away from me pristone ones 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.659
 there is a gun 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.269
 anyway 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.989
 up to 100 meters to then take and just 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.489
 shoot 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.110
 i don't understand ao 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.920
 by the way is debt not 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.560
 just shows that the rollback took place 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.820
 so let's try the protests in Syria 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.310
 tikhona cards so to speak 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.769
 to implement the idea of ​​the authors 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.030
 However, this is generally why we need to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.129
 pair with you really can not 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.970
 pass this one will 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.130
 you can't give him a gun even at the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.050
 slop games of sheep knuckles mate that is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.720
 this is no chick or old woman in principle 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.280
 don't have a weapon why can't this person 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.509
 shoot with me 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.969
 Why is movement on the cards here 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.479
 slowly I know the game took place having entered 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.590
 many kravets 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.129
 but there is no need 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.619
 waste chesalina 4 folders to 

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.039
 crawl dull scenery 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.819
 where is the principle of any center what 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.189
 there is no point because you have everything 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.999
 anyway everything will be great 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.419
 how could you quietly kill this nonsense 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.419
 UAH liter city 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.579
 I decided to play this game yet 

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:08.159
 to make 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.019
 because even an hour we would you by the union of heads 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.179
 note that we don’t have any weapons 

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.040
 melee fails nothing and nothing 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.940
 so the only way from 8 tsi 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.539
 try the first shot 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.009
 kill the person who stands on 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.169
 other end of the shotgun card 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.129
 but the cross side turns it 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.990
 causes the guards from us start looking from 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.990
 sides invisible to take fan 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.990
 but quickly delay the closest to the ransom from 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.240
 There are 88 of us left 8 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.400
 principle 8 lucky number of sciences 8,108 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.680
 I like it more 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.710
 and here is zero opposite 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.050
 the initiator of this hints to us that 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.310
 In principle, it would be nice to save 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.699
 because when we come out of this 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.810
 cohorts likely stray bullet now 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.900
 from japanese 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.430
 that you did not happen 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.100
 but I got worried after 10 minutes with 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.500
 eight crib passed this moment 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.690
 and got to the place where man 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.630
 caused an alarm but not one step 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.750
 disable it 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.619
 don't do anything at all 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.249
 Only my stupid brother drags for 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.960
 me who he is 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.130
 okay went down went down on 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.589
 oil therefore 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.150
 so much and brother 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.879
 account he climbed on top of the cover no one 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.809
 I hope he will be fine because 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.139
 carry vozhegova one of the main tasks 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.339
 percentage of this mission however 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.339
 I could walk myself because 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.210
 any injury and me coliuh 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.770
 Someone like the factory I am dying 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.219
 how many times have i tried 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.499
 expect time two three four and stand 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:38.580
 runs up 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.150
 you start to play our hands rustling 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.169
 as i don't know 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.770
 Senya South Park 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.860
 as soon as I did not arrive wait 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.259
 I got the door wrong 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.460
 in the end, I'm just a bloody man 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.300
 I don't know the dude who drank me 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.759
 before that he forced me to lower my body 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.969
 just services 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:00.009
 so always be for a year 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.270
 when you deal with asians 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.080
 but regret 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.879
 not long music played because the back 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.259
 another enemy appeared apparently and taking 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:08.909
 I have 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.369
 who likes on 

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.659
 cues so katar brought he is on 5 a 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:14.130
 died 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.970
 but nevertheless passed this mission and the second I 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.440
 saw something completely 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.129
 extraordinary 

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.389
 it is a dead end and four walls 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.219
 and in front of yaranga there is laser crap 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.039
 which 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.590
 If you go through the ball of Parliament 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.620
 but the mission alarm turns on 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.689
 failed 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:34.360
 and how I did not try to find what 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.059
 any way to overcome it i'm sure
