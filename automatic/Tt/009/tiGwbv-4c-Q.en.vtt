duality<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.270> my<00:01:49.450> first<00:01:49.690> choice<00:01:49.930> because<00:01:50.710> I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
duality is my first choice because I

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.890 
were very much I think I mean this could
probably<00:01:54.160> apply<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.550> anybody<00:01:54.970> because<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
probably apply to anybody because of the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.330
