00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the original manga which translates to

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.650 
the original manga which translates to
about<00:01:53.140> like<00:01:53.440> 5<00:01:53.740> manga<00:01:54.040> chapters<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.760> then

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
which is about 75 minutes which is

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.130 
which is about 75 minutes which is
pretty<00:02:01.119> damn<00:02:01.360> long<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:03.090> surprisingly<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.390> did

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
pretty damn long but surprisingly I did

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.130 
pretty damn long but surprisingly I did
not<00:02:05.320> feel<00:02:05.560> rushed<00:02:05.830> at<00:02:06.100> all<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:07.750> episodes

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
not feel rushed at all these episodes

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.979 
not feel rushed at all these episodes
are<00:02:08.470> pretty<00:02:08.739> jam-packed<00:02:09.340> or<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:10.600> episode

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
are pretty jam-packed or this episode

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.260 
are pretty jam-packed or this episode
was<00:02:11.050> pretty<00:02:11.290> jam<00:02:11.830> packed<00:02:12.100> with<00:02:12.250> action<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.030> I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
was pretty jam packed with action so I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.449 
was pretty jam packed with action so I
mean<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.080> was<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.440> there<00:02:14.770> was<00:02:14.860> some<00:02:15.040> dialogue

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
mean it was very there was some dialogue

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.690 
mean it was very there was some dialogue
but<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:16.540> mostly<00:02:16.750> action<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.190> think

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
but it was mostly action and I think

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.520 
but it was mostly action and I think
that's<00:02:18.910> why<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.090> didn't<00:02:19.330> feel<00:02:19.420> rushed<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:20.320> was

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
that's why I didn't feel rushed it was

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.250 
that's why I didn't feel rushed it was
manga<00:02:21.190> paste<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:21.820> opinion<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.420> mean<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
manga paste in my opinion I mean you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
manga paste in my opinion I mean you
could<00:02:23.380> get<00:02:23.560> through<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:24.040> first<00:02:24.310> volume<00:02:24.790> let

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
could get through that first volume let

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
could get through that first volume let
alone<00:02:25.330> five<00:02:25.660> chapters<00:02:26.170> easily<00:02:26.860> within<00:02:27.040> half

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
alone five chapters easily within half

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800 
alone five chapters easily within half
an<00:02:27.550> hour<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.150> reading<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:28.720> could

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
an hour of just reading it we could

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.770 
an hour of just reading it we could
probably<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:29.200> through<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.920> 5-10<00:02:30.610> minutes<00:02:31.000> but

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
probably get through it 5-10 minutes but

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.650 
probably get through it 5-10 minutes but
I<00:02:31.810> mean<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.890> episode<00:02:33.370> was<00:02:33.550> cruising<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.360> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I mean that episode was cruising and it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.830 
I mean that episode was cruising and it
felt<00:02:35.020> good<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:36.430> okay<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.970> there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
felt good so I'm okay with that there

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.440 
felt good so I'm okay with that there
were<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:37.989> couple<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.290> cuts<00:02:38.530> not<00:02:39.370> none<00:02:39.790> really<00:02:40.060> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
were a couple of cuts not none really to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.780

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

were a couple of little filler things
but<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.180> pretty<00:02:46.180> much<00:02:46.330> just<00:02:46.570> stuck<00:02:46.840> with<00:02:47.019> the

well<00:04:12.620> in<00:04:12.769> this<00:04:12.919> episode<00:04:13.189> when<00:04:13.579> we<00:04:13.730> see<00:04:13.939> piccolo

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
well in this episode when we see piccolo

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.719 
well in this episode when we see piccolo
getting<00:04:14.810> his<00:04:15.200> arm<00:04:15.469> blasted<00:04:15.950> off<00:04:16.039> by<00:04:16.190> radhika's

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
getting his arm blasted off by radhika's

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.629 
getting his arm blasted off by radhika's
attacking<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.509> air<00:04:17.720> he's<00:04:18.380> stripping<00:04:18.709> purple

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
attacking the air he's stripping purple

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.939 
attacking the air he's stripping purple
blood<00:04:19.789> rather<00:04:20.060> than<00:04:20.329> red<00:04:21.079> blood<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:21.560> there<00:04:21.859> was

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
blood rather than red blood so there was

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.980 
blood rather than red blood so there was
some<00:04:22.070> consistency<00:04:22.669> there<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.599> like<00:04:23.780> that

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
some consistency there and I like that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.950 
some consistency there and I like that
was<00:04:24.949> later<00:04:25.130> on<00:04:25.370> namekian<00:04:26.120> blood<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.479> purple<00:04:26.840> in

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
was later on namekian blood is purple in

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.510 
was later on namekian blood is purple in
that<00:04:27.110> red<00:04:28.870> other<00:04:29.870> than<00:04:29.990> that<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.889> pacing<00:04:31.310> was

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
that red other than that the pacing was

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.140 
that red other than that the pacing was
extremely<00:04:32.479> fast<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.199> felt<00:04:33.470> okay<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.150> I

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
extremely fast but it felt okay and I

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.520 
extremely fast but it felt okay and I
think<00:04:35.330> most<00:04:35.630> of<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.840> pacing<00:04:36.229> was<00:04:36.320> just

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
think most of that pacing was just

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.499 
think most of that pacing was just
because<00:04:36.740> into<00:04:36.979> action<00:04:37.370> they<00:04:37.940> basically<00:04:38.090> just

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
because into action they basically just

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.700 
because into action they basically just
got<00:04:39.139> right<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.580> original<00:04:40.729> episodes

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
got right to it in the original episodes

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.140 
got right to it in the original episodes
it<00:04:42.710> takes<00:04:42.949> him<00:04:43.099> three<00:04:43.280> episodes<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:43.789> kill<00:04:43.970> off

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
it takes him three episodes to kill off

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.839 
it takes him three episodes to kill off
raditz<00:04:44.630> right<00:04:45.349> after<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:46.220> first<00:04:46.580> little

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
raditz right after the first little

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.580 
raditz right after the first little
confrontation<00:04:47.509> where<00:04:47.630> he<00:04:47.780> smacks<00:04:48.139> him<00:04:48.320> behind

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
confrontation where he smacks him behind

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.529 
confrontation where he smacks him behind
the<00:04:48.710> back<00:04:48.889> but<00:04:49.400> they<00:04:49.520> basically<00:04:50.120> cut<00:04:50.419> out<00:04:50.509> all

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
the back but they basically cut out all

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.270 
the back but they basically cut out all
the<00:04:50.840> small<00:04:51.110> talk<00:04:51.349> which<00:04:51.650> was<00:04:51.800> filling<00:04:52.190> to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
the small talk which was filling to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.490 
the small talk which was filling to
begin<00:04:52.520> with<00:04:52.669> anyway<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.659> cut<00:04:53.870> off<00:04:54.020> all<00:04:54.320> the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
begin with anyway they cut off all the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.879 
begin with anyway they cut off all the
scenes<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:55.330> piccolo<00:04:56.740> basically<00:04:57.740> just

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
scenes of piccolo basically just

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:20.540 
to see a little bit of that but my

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.120 
to see a little bit of that but my
question<00:07:20.600> will<00:07:21.050> be<00:07:21.080> how<00:07:21.350> much<00:07:21.530> of<00:07:21.710> the<00:07:21.830> Gohan

question will be how much of the Gohan
stuff<00:07:22.400> is<00:07:22.490> going<00:07:22.610> to<00:07:22.669> be<00:07:22.730> cut<00:07:22.910> out<00:07:22.940> because<00:07:23.840> you

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
stuff is going to be cut out because you

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.720 
stuff is going to be cut out because you
have<00:07:24.140> episodes<00:07:24.800> where<00:07:24.980> he's<00:07:25.100> with<00:07:25.250> the<00:07:25.370> robot

the dinosaur and he's with those
children<00:07:28.580> the<00:07:29.060> orphans<00:07:29.450> and<00:07:29.860> it'll<00:07:30.860> be

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
children the orphans and it'll be

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.830 
children the orphans and it'll be
interesting<00:07:31.160> to<00:07:31.340> see<00:07:31.430> what<00:07:31.610> he<00:07:31.970> or<00:07:32.240> I<00:07:32.630> guess

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
interesting to see what he or I guess

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.840 
interesting to see what he or I guess
what<00:07:33.080> Toa<00:07:33.290> does<00:07:33.650> with<00:07:33.830> it<00:07:33.980> if<00:07:34.160> they<00:07:34.340> keep<00:07:34.580> some

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.850 
what Toa does with it if they keep some

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.420 
what Toa does with it if they keep some
of<00:07:34.940> it<00:07:35.060> if<00:07:35.180> they<00:07:35.270> let<00:07:35.450> some<00:07:35.720> of<00:07:35.750> it<00:07:35.870> go<00:07:36.430> the

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:37.430 
of it if they let some of it go the

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.220 
of it if they let some of it go the
stuff<00:07:37.669> I'm<00:07:37.880> gonna<00:07:38.060> hate<00:07:38.300> to<00:07:38.330> lose<00:07:38.750> the<00:07:39.080> most

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230 
stuff I'm gonna hate to lose the most

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.440 
stuff I'm gonna hate to lose the most
probably<00:07:39.650> be<00:07:39.770> the<00:07:39.950> the<00:07:40.280> orphan<00:07:40.580> stuff<00:07:40.820> I<00:07:41.030> know

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.450 
probably be the the orphan stuff I know

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.690 
probably be the the orphan stuff I know
it's<00:07:41.690> not<00:07:41.840> you<00:07:42.290> know<00:07:42.320> most<00:07:42.680> fans<00:07:43.010> favorite<00:07:43.520> but

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.700 
it's not you know most fans favorite but

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.850 
it's not you know most fans favorite but
I<00:07:43.880> kind<00:07:44.450> of<00:07:44.510> always<00:07:44.660> liked<00:07:44.990> it<00:07:45.169> but<00:07:45.380> I<00:07:45.590> have<00:07:45.800> a

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:45.860 
I kind of always liked it but I have a

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.140 
I kind of always liked it but I have a
feeling<00:07:46.070> that's<00:07:46.340> probably<00:07:46.669> going<00:07:46.820> to<00:07:46.880> be<00:07:46.940> gone

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.150 
feeling that's probably going to be gone

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.540 
feeling that's probably going to be gone
anyway<00:07:47.870> we'll<00:07:48.350> see<00:07:48.560> what<00:07:49.010> happens<00:07:49.160> in<00:07:49.520> the

anyway we'll see what happens in the

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.220 
anyway we'll see what happens in the
future<00:07:49.730> I<00:07:50.120> guess<00:07:50.600> that<00:07:50.630> was<00:07:50.870> a<00:07:50.900> little<00:07:50.990> bit<00:07:51.140> of

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.230 
future I guess that was a little bit of

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.430 
future I guess that was a little bit of
a<00:07:51.290> quick<00:07:51.500> review<00:07:51.680> but<00:07:52.100> that's<00:07:52.820> episode<00:07:53.600> 3<00:07:54.410> of
