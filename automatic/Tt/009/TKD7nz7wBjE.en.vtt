00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
they just have a little they have like a

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.190 
they just have a little they have like a
ring<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.090> slide<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.510> through<00:03:35.750> this<00:03:35.930> end

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
ring when you slide it through this end

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.729 
ring when you slide it through this end
here<00:03:36.439> flops<00:03:36.769> around<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.250> lot<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:39.049> one<00:03:39.290> is

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
here flops around a lot and this one is

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.530 
here flops around a lot and this one is
held<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.159> nice<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.340> tight<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:41.329> know<00:03:41.420> they

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
held in nice and tight you know they

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.119 
held in nice and tight you know they
felt<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:41.870> they<00:03:42.079> had<00:03:42.109> they<00:03:42.469> had<00:03:42.500> some<00:03:42.799> spring

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
felt like they had they had some spring

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.640 
felt like they had they had some spring
to<00:03:43.280> them<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.639> felt<00:03:43.970> midst<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.419> a<00:03:44.930> little

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
to them so I felt midst of a little

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.349 
to them so I felt midst of a little
better<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.459> they<00:03:46.700> felt<00:03:46.970> like<00:03:47.030> they<00:03:47.209> had<00:03:47.239> a

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
better so they felt like they had a

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.790 
better so they felt like they had a
little<00:03:47.569> spring

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
little spring

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.550 
little spring
but<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.760> was<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:50.150> little<00:03:50.720> hard<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.140> tell<00:03:51.350> when<00:03:51.470> I

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
but it was a little hard to tell when I

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.350 
but it was a little hard to tell when I
was<00:03:51.680> getting<00:03:51.770> we<00:03:52.490> were<00:03:52.610> passing<00:03:52.850> these<00:03:53.090> around

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
was getting we were passing these around

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.760 
was getting we were passing these around
so<00:03:53.690> different<00:03:54.020> people<00:03:54.200> can<00:03:54.350> hold<00:03:54.500> them<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
so different people can hold them and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.560 
so different people can hold them and
the<00:03:55.220> material<00:03:55.610> inside<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.330> really

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
the material inside is really

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.060 
the material inside is really
comfortable<00:03:56.870> except<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.620> also<00:03:57.740> kind<00:03:58.010> of

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
comfortable except it's also kind of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.790 
comfortable except it's also kind of
absorbent<00:03:58.670> so<00:03:59.390> we<00:03:59.630> noticed<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.170> lot<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.380> like

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
absorbent so we noticed a lot of like

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.650 
absorbent so we noticed a lot of like

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
you care to see the inside do well but I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.180 
you care to see the inside do well but I
noticed<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.170> second<00:04:03.590> time<00:04:03.740> I<00:04:03.770> put<00:04:04.010> them<00:04:04.100> on

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
noticed the second time I put them on

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.830 
noticed the second time I put them on
after<00:04:04.460> they've<00:04:04.550> been<00:04:04.730> around<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.030> crowd<00:04:05.270> if
