00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
thing first keep it on the one side then

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.879 
thing first keep it on the one side then
you<00:00:54.170> can<00:00:54.199> see<00:00:54.499> this<00:00:54.620> entire<00:00:54.979> panel<00:00:55.879> which<00:00:56.300> is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
you can see this entire panel which is

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.379 
you can see this entire panel which is
having<00:00:57.889> the<00:00:58.100> hard<00:00:58.309> drive<00:00:58.519> in<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.819> RAM<00:00:58.969> we'll

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
having the hard drive in the RAM we'll

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:00.759 
having the hard drive in the RAM we'll
start<00:00:59.629> with<00:00:59.749> the<00:00:59.839> hard<00:01:00.019> drive<00:01:00.170> Ram<00:01:00.409> then<00:01:00.649> we

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
start with the hard drive Ram then we

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.279 
start with the hard drive Ram then we
will<00:01:00.920> show<00:01:01.549> you<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.819> keyboard<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.449> that<00:01:03.139> will

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
will show you the keyboard and that will

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.869 
will show you the keyboard and that will
do<00:01:03.440> it<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.010> need<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.280> remove<00:01:04.489> all<00:01:04.699> these

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
do it so you need to remove all these

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:31.760 
do it so you need to remove all these
screws<00:01:05.150> over<00:01:05.299> here<00:01:05.570> one<00:01:05.870> by<00:01:06.080> one

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 

then<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:32.969> will<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> notch<00:01:33.630> over<00:01:33.810> here

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then there will be this notch over here

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.190 
then there will be this notch over here
in<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:36.200> screw

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
in which you have to put in the screw

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.410 
in which you have to put in the screw
driver<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.490> entire<00:01:38.759> panel<00:01:38.969> will<00:01:39.210> come

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
driver and this entire panel will come

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.919 
driver and this entire panel will come
out<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.560> here<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.270> RAM

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
out so here you can see you have the RAM

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.359 
out so here you can see you have the RAM
in<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> harddrive<00:01:43.560> exposed<00:01:44.039> here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
in the harddrive exposed here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.279 
in the harddrive exposed here
so<00:01:44.819> for<00:01:45.000> upgrading<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> RAM<00:01:45.630> basically<00:01:46.170> we

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
so for upgrading the RAM basically we

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.219 
so for upgrading the RAM basically we
just<00:01:46.319> need<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.859> remove<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> RAM<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.329> just

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
just need to remove the RAM here just

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.010 
just need to remove the RAM here just
need<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.219> two<00:01:50.310> fingers<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.020> using

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
need to use your two fingers and using

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
remove this and you can put in a similar

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.959 
remove this and you can put in a similar
memory<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.959> basically<00:01:58.289> a<00:01:58.579> ddr3<00:01:59.579> sodium

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
memory this is basically a ddr3 sodium

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.749 
memory this is basically a ddr3 sodium
memory<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.920> triple<00:02:02.189> three<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.429> guards<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
memory so one triple three my guards you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.160 
memory so one triple three my guards you
can<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> similar<00:02:03.329> memory<00:02:03.719> from<00:02:03.989> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
can take a similar memory from the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.870 
can take a similar memory from the
online<00:02:04.470> market<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:06.619> shops<00:02:07.619> near<00:02:07.890> your

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
online market or on your shops near your

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.809 
online market or on your shops near your
place<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.310> just<00:02:11.310> take<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> similar

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
place and you can just take a similar

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.160 
place and you can just take a similar
one<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> put<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.510> back<00:02:12.660> inside<00:02:13.970> put<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.170> press

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
one and put it back inside put it press

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.309 
one and put it back inside put it press
it<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:17.040> press<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.940> from<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.209> top<00:02:18.360> this

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
it and then press it from the top this

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.250 
it and then press it from the top this
is<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:20.819> coming<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.269> hard<00:02:21.450> drive<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
is it now coming to the hard drive the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.740 
is it now coming to the hard drive the
hard<00:02:22.380> drive<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.709> also<00:02:23.190> very<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.430> visible<00:02:24.390> as

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
hard drive is also very much visible as

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.030 
hard drive is also very much visible as
you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.049> see<00:02:25.940> there<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.329> screw<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:28.590> one

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you can see there is one screw this one
