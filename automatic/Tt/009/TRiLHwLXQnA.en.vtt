00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
hello what so the other day we took a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490 
hello what so the other day we took a
look<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:17.000> battery<00:00:18.000> saver<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.869> fair<00:00:19.350> few

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
look at battery saver and a fair few

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
look at battery saver and a fair few
people<00:00:19.830> also<00:00:20.070> asked<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:20.880> at

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
people also asked me to have a look at

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.840 
people also asked me to have a look at
juice<00:00:21.359> defender<00:00:22.400> there<00:00:23.400> seems<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
juice defender there seems to be the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.250 
juice defender there seems to be the
splitting<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> community<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> which

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
splitting of the community as to which

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800 
splitting of the community as to which
is<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> best<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.580> personally<00:00:27.090> both<00:00:27.480> apps

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is the best I think personally both apps

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.150 
is the best I think personally both apps
are<00:00:28.109> approaching<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> problem<00:00:29.010> slightly

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
are approaching the problem slightly

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.759 
are approaching the problem slightly
differently<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:30.240> battery<00:00:30.810> saver<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.619> it's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
differently with battery saver what it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
differently with battery saver what it's
doing<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> using<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.850> deep<00:00:33.059> sleep<00:00:33.210> mode

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
doing is using the deep sleep mode

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
doing is using the deep sleep mode
within<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> phone<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> effectively<00:00:34.620> turn<00:00:34.829> off

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
within the phone to effectively turn off

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.569 
within the phone to effectively turn off
the<00:00:35.370> vast<00:00:35.670> majority<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.450> phone's<00:00:37.579> power

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the vast majority of the phone's power

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
the vast majority of the phone's power
using<00:00:39.030> features<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> set<00:00:40.379> period<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> time

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using features for a set period of time

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.319 
using features for a set period of time
then<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> wakes<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> does<00:00:42.180> its

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
then it wakes up then it does its

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
then it wakes up then it does its
actions<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.440> goes<00:00:43.559> back<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> sleep

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
actions and then goes back to sleep

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
actions and then goes back to sleep
again<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.910> juice<00:00:45.149> defender<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:45.930> are<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
again with juice defender things are a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.990 
again with juice defender things are a
little<00:00:46.170> bit<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.410> granular<00:00:46.800> than<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
little bit more granular than that what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.250 
little bit more granular than that what
you<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.140> not

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you can actually do is it it's not

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
you can actually do is it it's not
really<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.530> deep<00:00:49.860> sleep<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.370> much<00:00:50.489> as

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
really about deep sleep so much as

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.389 
really about deep sleep so much as
disabling<00:00:51.510> particular<00:00:51.809> features<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
disabling particular features so if you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.180 
disabling particular features so if you
in<00:00:53.670> custom<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.199> settings<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
in custom and you go into settings you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it will actually operate Wi-Fi is

for and how long it will do those

for and how long it will do those
options<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.619> well<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> does

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
options for as well a lot of this does

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
options for as well a lot of this does
feel<00:01:18.030> quite<00:01:18.229> similar<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> deep<00:01:19.680> sleep<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
feel quite similar to deep sleep but it

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
feel quite similar to deep sleep but it
doesn't<00:01:20.790> seem<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.150> completely<00:01:21.689> across<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
doesn't seem to be completely across the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
doesn't seem to be completely across the
entire<00:01:22.650> device<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.340> only<00:01:23.549> dealing<00:01:23.820> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
entire device it's only dealing with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
entire device it's only dealing with
things<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.570> location<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.200> Wi-Fi

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
things like your location and your Wi-Fi

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
things like your location and your Wi-Fi
and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.100> mobile<00:01:26.430> data<00:01:26.840> which<00:01:27.840> may<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.409> much

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and the mobile data which may be much

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
and the mobile data which may be much
more<00:01:29.250> useful<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.670> people<00:01:29.850> obviously<00:01:30.390> if

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
more useful to people obviously if

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
more useful to people obviously if
you've<00:01:30.570> got<00:01:30.780> no<00:01:30.900> mobile<00:01:31.229> date<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:31.740> Wi-Fi<00:01:32.280> no

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you've got no mobile date or no Wi-Fi no

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.130 
you've got no mobile date or no Wi-Fi no
location<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.509> practically<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> deep

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
location you're practically in deep

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.340 
location you're practically in deep
sleep<00:01:34.350> anyway<00:01:35.479> but<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> gives<00:01:36.810> quite<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> nice

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sleep anyway but this gives quite a nice

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
sleep anyway but this gives quite a nice
amount<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> granular<00:01:38.009> control<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.850> which

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
amount of granular control over it which

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
amount of granular control over it which
I<00:01:39.450> quite<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.259> also<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.560> night<00:01:40.770> mode

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
I quite like you also have a night mode

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
I quite like you also have a night mode
as<00:01:41.189> well<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.030> obviously<00:01:42.329> at

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
as well so that you know obviously at

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.149 
as well so that you know obviously at
night<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.320> turns<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.710> stuff<00:01:43.979> off

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
night it just turns this stuff off

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.179 
night it just turns this stuff off
really<00:01:44.850> useful<00:01:45.180> apps<00:01:46.170> configuration<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.040> well

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
really useful apps configuration as well

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
really useful apps configuration as well
so<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.299> particular<00:01:48.600> apps

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so you can actually on particular apps

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
so you can actually on particular apps
bone<00:01:49.079> looks<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:50.670> app

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
bone looks of it so if you want an app

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
bone looks of it so if you want an app
to<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.479> able<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> wake<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:54.259> I've

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to be able to wake up then you can I've

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
to be able to wake up then you can I've
been<00:01:55.500> playing<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> app<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.850> 24

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
been playing with the app for about 24

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.039 
been playing with the app for about 24
hours

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
hours

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
hours
yeah<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> yesterday<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.460> certainly<00:01:59.820> found

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
yeah and yesterday I certainly found

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
yeah and yesterday I certainly found
that<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.869> battery<00:02:01.140> life<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.409> good<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.430> wasn't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that the battery life was good I wasn't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
that the battery life was good I wasn't
using<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> device<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> huge<00:02:04.380> amount<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
using the device for a huge amount of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
using the device for a huge amount of
different<00:02:05.009> things<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.969> more<00:02:06.180> kind<00:02:06.420> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
different things so it was more kind of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.529 
different things so it was more kind of
you<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.250> general<00:02:08.759> running<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.330> device

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you know just general running the device

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.390 
you know just general running the device
kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> sitting<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.619> sleeping<00:02:10.830> most<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
kind of sitting and sleeping most of the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.890 
kind of sitting and sleeping most of the
time<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> would<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:11.940> thought<00:02:12.180> using<00:02:12.720> these

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
time I would have thought using these

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
time I would have thought using these
various<00:02:13.200> controls

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
various controls

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.030 
various controls
and<00:02:14.099> yeah<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.640> would<00:02:14.790> say<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.629> did<00:02:16.290> feel<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.709> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and yeah I would say I did feel like I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.199 
and yeah I would say I did feel like I
was<00:02:17.069> getting<00:02:17.370> more<00:02:17.459> back<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> life

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
was getting more back to life

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.899 
was getting more back to life
for<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.599> time<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.260> were<00:02:19.439> I<00:02:20.099> had<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.640> put<00:02:20.819> an

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
for my time as it were I had to put an

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.220 
for my time as it were I had to put an
exact<00:02:21.209> amount<00:02:21.329> I'm<00:02:21.720> gonna<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.989> do<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.110> bit

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
exact amount I'm gonna have to do a bit

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.309 
exact amount I'm gonna have to do a bit
more<00:02:22.260> testing<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:23.459> certainly<00:02:23.819> good<00:02:24.720> app<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
more testing but certainly good app I

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.600 
more testing but certainly good app I
think<00:02:25.650> both<00:02:25.980> these<00:02:26.129> apps<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.489> really

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
think both these apps are really

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.000 
think both these apps are really
approaching<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.959> issue<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.500> saving<00:02:28.709> battery

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
approaching the issue of saving battery

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.780 
approaching the issue of saving battery
in<00:02:29.430> slightly<00:02:29.670> different<00:02:29.819> ways<00:02:31.489> which<00:02:32.489> one<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
in slightly different ways which one is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.509 
in slightly different ways which one is
better<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.299> would<00:02:33.810> say<00:02:34.019> use<00:02:34.379> both<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.890> see

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
better I would say use both and see

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.280 
better I would say use both and see
which<00:02:35.549> one<00:02:35.879> works<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.870> then<00:02:37.109> stick

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
which one works for you and then stick

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.949 
which one works for you and then stick
with<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.620> obviously<00:02:38.579> install<00:02:38.939> one<00:02:39.150> use

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
with that one obviously install one use

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.750 
with that one obviously install one use
it<00:02:40.109> test<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.530> see<00:02:41.099> what<00:02:41.220> kind<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.459> battery<00:02:41.670> life

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
it test it see what kind of battery life

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.250 
it test it see what kind of battery life
you<00:02:41.939> get<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.480> whether<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.840> fits<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.230> with

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
you get and whether that fits in with

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.449 
you get and whether that fits in with
your<00:02:43.500> routine<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.129> way<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.280> actually

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
your routine and the way you actually

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
your routine and the way you actually
use<00:02:44.760> your<00:02:44.879> device<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:46.200> try<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> other<00:02:46.799> one

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
use your device if not try the other one

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470 
use your device if not try the other one
one<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.459> them<00:02:47.609> is<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.000> perfect<00:02:48.450> for

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
one of them is going to be perfect for

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.319 
one of them is going to be perfect for
you<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.579> personally<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.609> because<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> way<00:02:51.299> I

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
you I personally just because the way I

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.300 
you I personally just because the way I
use<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:51.780> device<00:02:52.079> I'm<00:02:52.680> leaning<00:02:53.040> towards

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
use my device I'm leaning towards

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.309 
use my device I'm leaning towards
battery<00:02:53.579> saver<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.569> me<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.720> think<00:02:54.989> that's<00:02:55.139> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
battery saver for me I think that's the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.349 
battery saver for me I think that's the
better<00:02:55.709> overall<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.909> approach<00:02:57.209> to

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
better overall kind of approach to

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.210 
better overall kind of approach to
dealing<00:02:57.569> with<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.810> also<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:59.040> juice

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
dealing with this also with juice

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.009 
dealing with this also with juice
defender<00:02:59.670> they<00:02:59.939> do<00:03:00.000> seem<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.450> want<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.780> charge

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
defender they do seem to want to charge

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.319 
defender they do seem to want to charge
you<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.980> pro<00:03:02.489> version<00:03:02.760> although<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.239> think

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you for a pro version although I think

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.399 
you for a pro version although I think
there's<00:03:03.510> actually<00:03:03.720> three<00:03:03.870> or<00:03:03.930> four<00:03:04.200> different

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
there's actually three or four different

there's actually three or four different

lot<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.519> those<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:23.730> would<00:03:23.879> have<00:03:24.120> thought<00:03:24.329> would

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
lot of those I would have thought would

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.000 
lot of those I would have thought would
be<00:03:24.629> for<00:03:24.840> routes<00:03:25.019> only<00:03:25.199> so<00:03:25.620> you'd<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:25.949> have

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
be for routes only so you'd have to have

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.650 
be for routes only so you'd have to have
a<00:03:26.069> rooted<00:03:26.400> device<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.209> certainly<00:03:27.449> with<00:03:27.599> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
a rooted device but certainly with the
