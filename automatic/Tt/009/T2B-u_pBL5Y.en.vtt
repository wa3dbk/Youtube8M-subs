00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040 
the same thing the day after tomorrow so
I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.920> many<00:01:53.520> especially<00:01:53.940> our<00:01:54.240> disposal

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
I think many especially our disposal

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.990 
I think many especially our disposal
more<00:01:55.530> than<00:01:55.650> excited<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.520> are<00:01:56.640> counting

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

the<00:01:57.090> hours<00:01:57.240> from<00:01:57.540> now<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.980> think<00:01:59.430> they're

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the hours from now so I think they're

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.220 
the hours from now so I think they're
very<00:01:59.790> very<00:02:00.030> happy<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.080> opportunity

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
very very happy to have this opportunity

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.950 
very very happy to have this opportunity
and<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.310> try<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.330> than<00:02:03.510> their<00:02:03.720> best

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and and we try more than their best

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.150 
and and we try more than their best
hopefully<00:02:04.260> they<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.650> have<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.040> much

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
hopefully they don't have too much

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.540

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
by my robot o Shah strategy I think

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.090 
by my robot o Shah strategy I think
you'll<00:03:41.790> be<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> same<00:03:42.330> as<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:43.200> usually<00:03:43.590> play<00:03:43.740> I

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
you'll be the same as we usually play I

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.850 
you'll be the same as we usually play I
think<00:03:44.670> no<00:03:45.480> matter<00:03:45.600> who<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.930> opposition<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
think no matter who the opposition is I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.830 
think no matter who the opposition is I
think<00:03:46.920> it's<00:03:47.280> important<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:48.030> concentrate<00:03:48.660> on

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
think it's important we concentrate on

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.220 
think it's important we concentrate on
our<00:03:48.960> own<00:03:49.080> game<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.940> think<00:03:50.940> obviously<00:03:51.330> they

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
our own game I think obviously they

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.670 
our own game I think obviously they
galaxy<00:03:53.480> have<00:03:54.480> players<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.990> high<00:03:55.110> standard

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
galaxy have players of a high standard

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.700 
galaxy have players of a high standard
so<00:03:56.310> we'll<00:03:56.580> have<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.110> well<00:03:58.110> probably<00:03:58.440> play<00:03:58.680> I

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
so we'll have to well probably play I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.710 
so we'll have to well probably play I
think<00:03:58.950> more<00:03:59.700> defensively<00:04:00.210> because<00:04:00.510> when

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
think more defensively because when

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.060 
think more defensively because when
you're<00:04:00.840> playing<00:04:00.990> against<00:04:01.290> such<00:04:01.800> strong

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
you're playing against such strong

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.680 
you're playing against such strong
attacking<00:04:02.550> players<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
attacking players you have to have a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.440 
attacking players you have to have a
defensive<00:04:04.410> mindset<00:04:04.770> i<00:04:05.130> think<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:05.880> that's

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
defensive mindset i think that's that's

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.880 
defensive mindset i think that's that's
the<00:04:06.660> way<00:04:06.780> we<00:04:06.900> usually<00:04:07.050> play<00:04:07.320> against<00:04:07.710> tough

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
the way we usually play against tough

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.410 
the way we usually play against tough
teams<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.430> obviously<00:04:08.730> we're<00:04:08.940> trying<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.240> play

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
teams and obviously we're trying to play

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.420 
teams and obviously we're trying to play
on<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.050> counter<00:04:10.410> attack<00:04:10.440> using<00:04:11.070> some<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
on the counter attack using some of the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.090 
on the counter attack using some of the
speed<00:04:11.640> by<00:04:11.820> Chiefy<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.630> other<00:04:13.320> players<00:04:13.620> but<00:04:14.070> i

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
speed by Chiefy and other players but i

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.400 
speed by Chiefy and other players but i
think<00:04:14.520> we'll<00:04:15.090> obviously<00:04:15.600> we<00:04:15.990> have<00:04:16.110> to<00:04:16.140> be

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
think we'll obviously we have to be

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.130 
think we'll obviously we have to be
aware<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.710> the<00:04:17.400> ability<00:04:17.850> of<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.450> opposition

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
aware of the ability of the opposition

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.620 
aware of the ability of the opposition
and<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> think<00:04:19.620> as<00:04:20.190> usual<00:04:20.670> like<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.060> buy<00:04:21.360> we<00:04:21.390> pay

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
and I think as usual like we buy we pay

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.600 
and I think as usual like we buy we pay
the<00:04:21.750> sqa<00:04:22.230> like<00:04:22.530> we<00:04:22.650> played<00:04:22.800> against<00:04:23.130> other

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
the sqa like we played against other

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.520 
the sqa like we played against other
stronger<00:04:24.060> teams<00:04:24.390> will<00:04:24.750> probably<00:04:25.410> add<00:04:25.500> more

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
stronger teams will probably add more

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.560 
stronger teams will probably add more
defensive<00:04:26.250> mindset<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.670> enjoy<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.390> play

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
defensive mindset and enjoy and play

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.270 
defensive mindset and enjoy and play
play<00:04:27.780> on<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.990> counter-attack<00:04:28.320> are<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.100> guys

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
play on the counter-attack are you guys

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.360 
play on the counter-attack are you guys
intimidated<00:04:30.000> or<00:04:30.120> pressure<00:04:30.980> no<00:04:31.980> no<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.190> think

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
intimidated or pressure no no I think

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.940 
intimidated or pressure no no I think
it's<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:33.240> think<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.660> an<00:04:34.200> exciting<00:04:34.740> time<00:04:34.770> I

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
it's I think it's an exciting time I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.560 
it's I think it's an exciting time I
think<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.400> great<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:35.790> Philippine<00:04:36.180> football
