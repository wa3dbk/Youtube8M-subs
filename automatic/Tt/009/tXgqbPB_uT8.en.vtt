00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.870
Ja Jan! I watched TV on my iPhone.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:10.300
It's really clear. (blurring it for copyrighting)

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:14.190
This TV program is not from Tokyo.

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:20.730
I'm in Akihabara to go to I-O DATA exhibition.

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.060
He is Nishide-san. Konnichiwa

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:28.570
I heard the interesting thing is here.

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:33.110
"Streaming TV adapter VULKANO FLOW"

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:41.980
It can make iPhone / Android become a TV screen.

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:47.920
At first I thought 1seg TV is enough.

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.460
But we can operate from App.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.820
operate what?

00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:55.090
The VULKANO FLOW and... What is it?

00:00:55.091 --> 00:01:01.230
"This is the TV tuner or HDD recorder."

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:05.630
"Connecting to VULKANO FLOW by AV cable"

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:09.640
This is a IR cable.

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:14.730
"It lights as remote control sign."

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:20.270
possible to change channels by a smart phone, right?

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:24.840
You can control a tuner from out.

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.440
This is its UI, and this is recorder UI.

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:35.980
If connecting HDD recorder, can play recorded videos.

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:41.800
So… we can play it from overseas, right?

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:45.150
This is the internet streaming.

00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.750
too much miracle I can't understand

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:57.560
Can the earthquake victims who moved to far away watch TV program of their hometown?

00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:01.340
"Yes. Now connecting Sendai city"

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:06.650
This is exactly the TV show from Sendai.

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.690
In the commuter trains,

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:16.860
Many people watch the recorded TV programs by own iPod / iPhone.

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.330
So I recommend to you the VULKANO FLOW.

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:27.560
You don't need spending morning time to sync videos to your iPhone.

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:32.680
We'll start help service to set it up.

00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:37.700
visiting your home and we set it up.

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:47.140
VULKANO FLOW: ¥12,800, set up: ¥13,000, App: ¥1,500

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:50.710
Wait, wait… Is it only 12,800yen!?

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:56.720
"Yes" Wow very low price!!

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:04.600
Every iOS/Android devices and PC can be TV screens.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.690
