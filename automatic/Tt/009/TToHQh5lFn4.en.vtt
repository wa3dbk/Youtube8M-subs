00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 hello everyone you have a stimulus alexander 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 today we will talk about using 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:14.700
 polarizing filter in the subject 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:16.379
 photos to my shame I am only a year 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 a half ago first tried 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.039
 Polarik for some reason this topic before 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.109
 avoided me yes I read all sorts 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 articles about the magical fizra who allegedly 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.599
 removes on reflection from water glasses 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.189
 but then it did not hook me so I 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.480
 forgot about this filter as much as a few 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.070
 years and then somehow I visited 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 master class one very good 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 a photographer who demonstrated how 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 Polarik acts very casually 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 told youtube now we will remove 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.640
 glitches with a polarizing filter 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 wow i said voice to pretty 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 loudly and thought to himself not otherwise 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 black magic but realizing that everyone is looking at 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 me like an elephant and fallen down i will take 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 and waited for the end of the master class 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 to have time to shop to buy a polarist 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.800
 why does he need this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 polarizing polarizer filter helps 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.430
 remove reflections and enhance reflection 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320
 color saturation polarization 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.100
 the filter looks just like any 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 another filter 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 but it is not quite so it consists of two 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 parts that rotate relatively 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.220
 each other and just rotating the front 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.220
 the lens we change the effect 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.830
 I think this is awesome unfortunately far 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.409
 not always so easy 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.540
 remove all glare work efficiency 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.229
 depends on various factors such as 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.229
 angle of incidence 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.120
 lens this filter is installed 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.550
 just like all the other filters 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.180
 that is, wound in front like this 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.260
 here it opens its first 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.820
 serious flaw 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.640
 lenses with different thread diameters 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.800
 will have to buy your polarizer they are worth 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 quite a bit of caution not 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.880
 buy cheap filters for thousands 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.990
 one and a half thousand rubles especially if 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.490
 you have a good lens 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.650
 it definitely works here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 saying stingy pays twice regret 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.740
 checked on my own experience and by the way 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.600
 I was also warned 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 the bottom line is that the quality of these glass 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.350
 filters so low that they spoil 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.060
 frame and through your expensive optics 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.020
 passes already ruined and cheap 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.850
 filter picture 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.470
 the image becomes muddy dramatically 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.110
 falls heavily in general is not necessary by the way 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.180
 due to the effect of reflection angles on the effect 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.860
 rendered by the polarizer is not recommended 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.360
 use it at wide angles 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.459
 polarization can come true 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.130
 uneven for example in the center of the picture 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.870
 it will be saturated with color and on the sides there is no 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.240
 another interesting moment with metal 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.950
 Polaric objects are useless as they are. 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.930
 again very strong highlights here such here 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 sadness also need to consider that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.050
 the polarist steals the light the picture becomes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.360
 darker 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.489
 exposure changes by one or two steps 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 Polarik popular tool among all 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.910
 photographers and as we found out in 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 subject shooting he is very even 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.459
 useful with you was in the boat Alexander 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.459
 until
