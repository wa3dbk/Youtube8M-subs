00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
hopefully they can improve on spike in

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.189 
hopefully they can improve on spike in
that<00:06:13.120> state<00:06:13.389> would<00:06:13.509> spike<00:06:13.779> that<00:06:13.930> actually

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
that state would spike that actually

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.899 
that state would spike that actually
better<00:06:14.439> because<00:06:14.589> you<00:06:14.919> know<00:06:15.039> switching<00:06:15.639> to<00:06:15.879> a

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
better because you know switching to a

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.019 
better because you know switching to a
different<00:06:15.969> channel<00:06:16.569> always<00:06:17.610> causes<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:18.939> know

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
different channel always causes you know

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.629 
different channel always causes you know
ratings<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.659> drop<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.110> little<00:06:20.439> bit<00:06:20.529> at<00:06:20.740> first<00:06:20.770> so

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
ratings to drop a little bit at first so

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.300 
ratings to drop a little bit at first so
