and this is gone we attached my steering

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.010 
and this is gone we attached my steering
mechanism<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.969> might<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.420> done<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
mechanism which I might have done in the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.940 
mechanism which I might have done in the
next<00:00:40.140> video<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.989> yeah<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> new<00:00:43.410> pipe<00:00:43.710> as

next video and yeah I have a new pipe as
well<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:44.399> last<00:00:44.579> video<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> take<00:00:45.480> her

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
well in my last video I had to take her

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.100 
well in my last video I had to take her

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
on and I wouldn't fit through there so I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.959

had<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> take<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.860> new<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.850> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
had to take it out and get new one and I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.840 
had to take it out and get new one and I
got<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.860> bolted<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.550> place

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

nicely and this is my new steering wheel
I<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.830> hacked<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.030> rest<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:19.020> would

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
I just hacked off the rest that it would

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
I just hacked off the rest that it would
be<00:01:19.439> normally<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.700> can't<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.180> because

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
be normally you can't really see because

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
be normally you can't really see because
since<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> steering<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> won't<00:01:23.520> bend<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
since the steering I won't bend all the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
since the steering I won't bend all the
way<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> upside<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
way but this is upside down and I just

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.480 
way but this is upside down and I just
hacked<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> sides<00:01:30.860> then<00:01:31.860> I'll<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.040> put

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
hacked off the sides then I'll just put

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
hacked off the sides then I'll just put
these<00:01:33.030> are<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.360> those<00:01:33.540> racing<00:01:33.990> bikes<00:01:34.200> really

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
these are off those racing bikes really

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.730
