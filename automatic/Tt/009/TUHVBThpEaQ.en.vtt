00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.930
 [music] 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:17.030
 Hello everyone, today I will show you another 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.220
 phone that came to me by chance 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.060
 I decided to make a mini-review on him 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.919
 show what this device is worth it 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.430
 buy what he is 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.260
 was or are you like someone who reads w 8 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.990
 being 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:40.579
 This is a phone with full hd screen and 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.340
 with a turbocharged 6589 3 processor 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.010
 nuclear which runs at frequency 1 and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.140
 5 hertz principle is more difference from w 8 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.690
 there is nothing standard this phone is on 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.170
 16 gigabyte version let's see 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.900
 extended equipment with a boot here 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.600
 so here is the book than not like this 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 phone mind was not on the review in white 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.429
 here who wants to see the review 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:18.759
 here here is a reference review review on w 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:22.039
 8 and made a nice phone here 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.920
 look now at the advanced 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.450
 model 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.130
 I liked the rear cover on it 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.649
 really looks very cool 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.700
 light is called it is not black and so 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.049
 understood and the color gray is gray and here 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.289
 it is a structural 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.240
 not structural as sweeping done 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.039
 cover but very cool looks and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.359
 the phone is pretty stylish 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.549
 grade further we have a standard 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.920
 principle 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.319
 protective film still we have a gift 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:05.259
 and headphones 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:09.069
 less and have no charge let's turn on 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.069
 show you a couple of tests 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 if I still have such a telephone here 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.769
 umi x2 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 so now let's compare the screens 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.280
 what is better 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:38.590
 then the phone is loaded ointment 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.150
 Worth the brightness one hundred percent like 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.250
 see the screen is pretty bright after all 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.350
 full hd 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.750
 everything works fine first antutu test 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.780
 and on the town ace shows 12 thousand 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.140
 seven hundred eighty three 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.330
 parrots I don't remember how many looked 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.450
 standard version but something like that 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.960
 about 13,000 why such a result and how 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 And the turbocharged processor costs to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.320
 advanced because the screen 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.840
 full hd lives a lot takes over from 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.410
 processor therefore so much difference in 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.250
 tests 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.690
 not visible only will be felt in there in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.940
 load applications so on according to tests 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.140
 it turns out that there is no difference 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:39.040
 because the screen is as you see 1920 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:40.930
 at 1080 and a pixel density of 480 by the way 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.190
 density is greater than that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.459
 and umi x2 no umi x2 440 or 441 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:54.030
 And so in principle, completely phones 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:56.190
 identical noumi also costs 6589 turbo 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.510
 accelerator costs 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.110
 544 basically everything is the same 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.400
 there is nothing more to show you here 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.420
 now i will do some more 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.660
 tests 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.450
 it's not on mark 2 and 3d mark will 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.230
 run and multitouch let's multitouch 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.480
 we have a phone on 5 touches 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:26.200
 6 touch see does not support as well 5 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.870
 5 touches five fingers phone 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.160
 supports 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.709
 a foreign car shows us 34 frames in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.199
 second is not a good result 

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:41.999
 because the crane itself is very much 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.580
 pulls and therefore 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:47.419
 eat half processor 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.279
 yourself tap to show it all 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:05:01.529
 reproduce and so on 3d mark 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:05:04.129
 shows we now boot 3584 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.129
 points 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.990
 Well, in principle, no more differences full 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:18.970
 hd supports the picture is certainly juicier 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.100
 than from the usual, but not everyone will see it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:26.080
 will only be compared if someone 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.360
 kept the usual w 8 and this buy yourself 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.090
 so he will see the difference if the person 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.470
 did not keep the usual w8 then there is no sense 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.810
 how to compare because he doesn't 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.510
 see the difference if you compare the screens 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.789
 comic two volumes umi x2 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.940
 I like the screen more, it is brighter 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:52.210
 as you can see he has a more pleasant screen 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.510
 maybe due to the fact that there is still a protective 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:59.110
 The film is on the eighth w but I do not know 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.169
 of course Iâ€™ll bring me I would choose 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.820
 between these two phones I would choose 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.590
 died umi better assembled 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.550
 felt this here iron frame 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:16.539
 edging and I think all the same for 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.300
 umi looks more stylish than w 8 although 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:22.180
 principle 5 there is 5 inch there is five 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.979
 There is not much difference to each 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:31.470
 choose your own there are two phones in 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:37.780
 one price category with such here 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:40.449
 me a screen choose each 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.400
 that like it and choose this 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.870
 Basically, a short review I wanted you 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.080
 show that this is a phone by itself 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.409
 presents you can buy it good 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.050
 model to w 8 standard good model 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.050
 to this already turbocharged processor 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.909
 need more power here he is phone 16 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.380
 gigabytes of internal micro sd memory 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:04.680
 card supported cover goes to 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.110
 extended configuration very cool 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.060
 Well, so today, thank you all 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.510
