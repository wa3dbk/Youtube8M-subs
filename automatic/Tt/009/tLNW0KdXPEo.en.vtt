00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
expected of them of course most of them

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.109 
expected of them of course most of them
will<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.650> conducted<00:00:22.980> exercises<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.939> like

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
will have conducted exercises and like

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.859 
will have conducted exercises and like
this<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.449> exactly<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.840> same<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:26.010> let's<00:00:26.220> see

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
this or exactly the same so let's see

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.140 
this or exactly the same so let's see
most<00:00:27.869> exercises<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> conduct<00:00:29.490> their

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
most exercises not to conduct their

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.290 
most exercises not to conduct their
favorite<00:00:30.720> pastime<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.590> can't<00:00:32.059> pursue<00:00:33.059> their

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
favorite pastime they can't pursue their

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.760 
favorite pastime they can't pursue their
hobby<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> work<00:00:34.440> twice<00:00:34.710> as

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
hobby but they have to work twice as

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.280 
hobby but they have to work twice as
hard<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.340> everyone<00:00:36.120> else<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> pitch<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
hard as everyone else on the pitch so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
hard as everyone else on the pitch so
let's<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> look<00:00:37.829> exactly<00:00:38.309> at<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
let's have a look exactly at what this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:01:18.420 
let's have a look exactly at what this
exercise<00:00:39.360> demands<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> players

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.740 

so<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.580> obviously<00:01:19.880> purely<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.360> passing

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
so this obviously purely a passing

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.410 
so this obviously purely a passing
exercises<00:01:21.440> which<00:01:24.040> forces<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.820> players<00:01:26.120> to
