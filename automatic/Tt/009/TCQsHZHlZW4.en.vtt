00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
get that at all with his hair

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.289 
get that at all with his hair
and<00:01:39.530> like<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.650> said<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.549> non<00:01:41.700> process

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and like I said it is the non process

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.310 
and like I said it is the non process
Brazilian<00:01:43.049> virgin<00:01:43.470> hair<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.390> came<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
Brazilian virgin hair and it came in a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010 
Brazilian virgin hair and it came in a
natural<00:01:46.770> Brown<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.149> believe<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
natural Brown and I believe that this is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.609 
natural Brown and I believe that this is
actually<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.040> black<00:01:50.759> than<00:01:51.619> brown

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
actually a little more black than brown

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.800 
actually a little more black than brown
but<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> okay<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.180> only<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but it's okay because I only have a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.350 
but it's okay because I only have a
little<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> hair<00:01:55.829> left<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.090> show

brown that matches my scalp it's like a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.160 
brown that matches my scalp it's like a
maybe<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.290> shade<00:02:16.770> darker<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.020> figure

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
maybe a shade darker so I have to figure

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.949 
maybe a shade darker so I have to figure
out<00:02:19.410> how<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.709> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.570> make<00:02:21.930> the

out how I'm going to you know make the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.710 
out how I'm going to you know make the
the<00:02:22.530> two<00:02:22.740> colors<00:02:23.190> work<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:23.910> far<00:02:24.240> as<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the two colors work as far as like the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.550

to<00:03:05.760> get<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> weave<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:09.510> my

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
to get a weave was because I I like my

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.660 
to get a weave was because I I like my
natural<00:03:10.110> hair<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:10.650> sometimes<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.310> get<00:03:11.610> so

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
natural hair but sometimes I just get so

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.259 
natural hair but sometimes I just get so
frustrated<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.890> especially<00:03:13.890> when<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
frustrated with it especially when the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.729 
frustrated with it especially when the
twist<00:03:15.510> outs<00:03:15.690> don't<00:03:15.959> turn<00:03:16.110> out<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.290> way<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.560> I

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
twist outs don't turn out the way that I

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.509 
twist outs don't turn out the way that I
wanted<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:19.019> time<00:03:19.680> consumption<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
wanted to or the time consumption and

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.759 
wanted to or the time consumption and
that<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> big<00:03:21.269> thing<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.780> having<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.560> set

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
