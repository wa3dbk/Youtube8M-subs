00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.620
On the last weekend of August we headed to the Muonio river to end our salmon season.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.340
We went to a quiet spot that we’ve been in already.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.660
We knew that it’s possible to catch big salmons there.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.920
The spot has 5 star tent accommodation.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.020
We though that it would be fun to have the salmon season end celebration there.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.640
Väylä river might not be the best place to train fly fishing for salmon, but you have to start somewhere.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.980
During summer we spent many weekends in Väylä river in different places.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.140
We saw some fish and we had some fish on the line, but we did not manage to catch any.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.340
We fished the first evening with floating lines and nothing happened.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360
The next evening Eemeli swapped to some heavy sinking line and then it started to happen.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.660
Did the running line come home?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.180
-Yeah, it’s home.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.900
This is a big salmon, the tail was like a shovel.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.340
Be careful with pulling it. There is that stone right over there.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.740
Put some pressure on it.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
I’m sure it’s at least 15 kg.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.720
Fucking outrageous.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.880
Damn I can’t grab it, my hands can’t reach around it, not even close.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420
Yeah!

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.740
GODDAMN!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.600
The fish was the first salmon over 10 kg we have caught in our group.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.840
The trip ended to be pretty unforgettable.
