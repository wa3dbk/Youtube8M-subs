00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 Downloads and whose roll in 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello, today's review will be 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 interesting to people for whom super mario 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 battle toads tanchiki kondrada least 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.170
 mortal kombat is finally not just empty 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.910
 sound for those who spent all their childhood 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 these gaming masterpieces 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 The company has released a rhythmics game 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 prefix based on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.340
 7 inch tablet which is rough 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 saying screwed the joystick which 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.710
 actually allows full 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 enjoy old school hits and so 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.620
 first I propose to look at the outside 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 device view 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 I immediately want to note the size 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 The prefix is ​​big enough and unlikely 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 whether fit into your jeans pocket 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.110
 therefore, a portable console can be 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 to name only a very big stretch in 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 same time the device has acceptable 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.920
 three hundred and fifty-five thickness and weight 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.539
 grams such a mass has been achieved for 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 expense of application is not the most expensive 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.329
 materials body plastic and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 scratches fast enough 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 front and rear grooves which 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.080
 allow you to conveniently hold the console and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.780
 don't worry about being in the heat of the game 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 battles she suddenly slip out of hand 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.049
 the touch screen is covered with a protective 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 plastic which is very fast 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.150
 fingerprinted and unlikely 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 it will be good to withstand scratches 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.210
 by the way the screen is far from the best it is 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 has poor viewing angles and unimportant 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.630
 color rendering that in principle is quite 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.939
 expected from a device so low 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 price category on both sides of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.829
 the screen is located almost all 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.740
 control buttons on the left standard 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.280
 cross the select button below the button 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.650
 volume controls and analog stick 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.110
 to the right of the screen was a hole 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.940
 for the microphone under which is 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.310
 standard for sony consoles unit 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.100
 control buttons which depict 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 Cross the circle and triangle 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 lift there is a start button without which 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.229
 just can't do while playing 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.420
 Super Mario 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 under the start button there are buttons 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 android controls this home button 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 back button and menu button 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 over the screen cozy front 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.430
 0.3 megapixel webcam now 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.739
 go through the ends of the console on the bottom 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.780
 there are no connectors on the left side 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.680
 Only that on the bottom of the tablet there is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.690
 two loops 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.730
 which you can safely lace 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.310
 which is unfortunately not included 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 found on the top 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.700
 Two Triggers and connector microusb hdmi out 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.890
 standard minijack from headphones to the right 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.530
 lock enable button slot 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.600
 micro sd card and slot for 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.060
 connect charger 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.190
 Now turn the console and see 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.650
 What is cozy on her back 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 there is a rear camera and a button 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.570
 which reset was hidden in one of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.000
 slot for speakers works prefix 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.930
 on a processor with a clock speed of 1.3 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.870
 gigahertz has 512 megabytes of RAM 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.090
 and 4 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.970
 which can be expanded with micro 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.880
 Sd card I will immediately say that the prefix with 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.730
 difficult to cope with android 4 0 4 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350
 and does not work very well and so therefore 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 expect more from her than 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.329
 start playing vintage consoles 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 Just not worth it by the way in the device 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.709
 from rhythmics out of the box installed 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.570
 great console emulator which 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.540
 supports many formats 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.750
 games ranging from games for atari and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.790
 ending with hits for playstation 1 if 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.489
 You ask where to take the game then this 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.650
 question will help you google which 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.970
 will show hundreds of links to archives with 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.430
 thousands of games 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.310
 Summing up, I’ll only say that by making a review. 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.989
 This console I am with great pleasure 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.359
 plunged into my nostalgic world 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.420
 childhood and gladly shook it so 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.459
 say the old days once again stress that 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.640
 prefix which is intended for 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.050
 emulation and city of old consoles and if 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.160
 you put something on her 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.069
 modern games 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.959
 you will be very disappointed because 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.849
 it's almost impossible to play them 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.310
 sugar screen is unimportant 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.260
 responsiveness but the hardware is not 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.410
 designed for something more complex 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.600
 than drawing 8-bit graphics so 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.389
 if you want to play the hits of the past 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.100
 years from dendy sega or playstation then 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.040
 rhythmics offers you this opportunity 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.750
 for quite reasonable money but on 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.820
 This all with you was Ilya Cossacks not 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.250
 forget to subscribe to the channel to 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.139
 Watch the new video the first place 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.510
 thumbs up and come to us 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.510
 social glasses here they are on the screen for now
