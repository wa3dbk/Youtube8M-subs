a<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:56.250> talented<00:00:56.460> player<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.379> he

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
a really talented player but I think he

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
a really talented player but I think he
need<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:59.850> understand<00:01:00.300> sometimes<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.960> talent

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
need to understand sometimes that talent

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.420 
need to understand sometimes that talent
is<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.469> enough<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.690> if<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.979> understand

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is not enough and if we do understand

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
is not enough and if we do understand
that<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.000> keep<00:01:06.240> working<00:01:06.720> hard<00:01:06.990> every<00:01:07.979> day

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that and he keep working hard every day

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.109 
that and he keep working hard every day
like<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:10.080> did<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.040> last<00:01:11.250> 45<00:01:11.549> months<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
like we did it in the last 45 months of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
like we did it in the last 45 months of
the<00:01:12.210> season<00:01:12.330> last<00:01:12.689> year<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.159> player

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the season last year he will be a player

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880

think<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.090> as<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.360> football<00:03:38.780> club<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.230> to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
think we as a football club have to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.590 
think we as a football club have to
choose<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.280> right<00:03:40.310> Club<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.000> players<00:03:41.300> to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
choose the right Club for the players to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.100 
choose the right Club for the players to
go<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.050> develop<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.190> improve<00:03:43.660> his<00:03:44.660> weakness

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
go and develop and improve his weakness

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.910 
go and develop and improve his weakness
and<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> there's<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.880> different<00:03:47.330> way<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.920> and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
and and there's a different way and and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.380 
and and there's a different way and and
I<00:03:49.040> think<00:03:49.250> as<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.430> club<00:03:49.760> we<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.150> a

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
I think as a club we have a

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.410 
I think as a club we have a
responsibility<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:51.170> choose<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.850> club<00:03:53.150> and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
responsibility to choose the club and

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.750 
responsibility to choose the club and
the<00:03:53.540> right<00:03:53.750> Club<00:03:53.959> for<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.170> boys<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.769> develop

the right Club for the boys to develop

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.199 
the right Club for the boys to develop
and<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.340> think<00:03:58.550> when<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.790> look<00:03:58.820> at<00:03:59.060> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and and I think when you look at the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.810 
and and I think when you look at the
last<00:03:59.330> few<00:03:59.630> years<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.230> loans<00:04:01.870> wasn't<00:04:03.820> best

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
last few years the loans wasn't best

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.120 
last few years the loans wasn't best
decision<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.600> make<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.769> some<00:04:06.920> players

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
decision we make because some players

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.250 
decision we make because some players
came<00:04:07.400> back<00:04:07.610> o<00:04:07.640> players<00:04:08.000> went<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.510> clubs<00:04:08.780> didn't

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
came back o players went to clubs didn't

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.979 
came back o players went to clubs didn't

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
play in the right position so that's why

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.250
