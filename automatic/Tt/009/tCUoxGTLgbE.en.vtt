from<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.050> experience<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.100> takes<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.640> 12

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
from my experience this takes about 12

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.040 
from my experience this takes about 12
minutes<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.690> complete<00:00:47.239> then<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.629> Chromebook

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.119 
will turn on and you'll have a fresh
install<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.590> ahead<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
install so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
install so I'm going to go ahead and
enter<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.699> Wi-Fi<00:00:54.449> password<00:00:54.480> and

enter in my Wi-Fi password and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
enter in my Wi-Fi password and
everything<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.309> step<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.420> important

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
everything this step is really important

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.950 
everything this step is really important
because<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.160> fact<00:00:59.460> need<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.420> working

Wi-Fi network for this installation to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
Wi-Fi network for this installation to
work<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:05.010> sure<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.549> have

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that so we're going to click continue

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.179 
that so we're going to click continue
and<00:01:09.090> I'm<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> accept<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.650> Terms<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
Use
nobody<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.170> reads<00:01:13.500> these<00:01:13.860> anyway<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> tell

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
nobody really reads these anyway to tell

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.859 
nobody really reads these anyway to tell
you<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> truth<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:17.509> then<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
you the truth and then it's going to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
you the truth and then it's going to
check<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.590> updates

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
check for updates

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
check for updates
it<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.880> doesn't<00:01:21.240> install<00:01:21.869> anything<00:01:22.200> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it really doesn't install anything it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
it really doesn't install anything it
will<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:25.110> through<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
will just do this and just go through it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.810 
will just do this and just go through it
like<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> doesn't<00:01:26.009> actually<00:01:26.369> install<00:01:26.700> an

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like it doesn't actually install an

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.780 
like it doesn't actually install an
update<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.479> reason<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.080> why

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
update for some reason I don't know why

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.569 
update for some reason I don't know why
and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> sign

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and then you're going to want to sign

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.710 
and then you're going to want to sign
into<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.659> Google<00:01:33.740> account<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> do

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
into your Google account you need to do

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
into your Google account you need to do
this<00:01:36.869> step<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.530> can't<00:01:37.890> log<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.060> guest

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this step you can't log in as guest

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
this step you can't log in as guest
because<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.229> won't<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.560> able<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.799> access<00:01:40.950> the

because you won't be able to access the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
because you won't be able to access the
terminal<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.960> able<00:01:43.110> to

terminal which we need to be able to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.910 
terminal which we need to be able to
access

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820 

and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:52.030> we're<00:01:52.480> going<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.690> go<00:01:52.840> right<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.470> the

so then we're going to type in the same

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.170 
so then we're going to type in the same
command<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.310> we're<00:03:31.640> going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> scroll<00:03:32.150> over

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
command but we're going to scroll over

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
then we're going to put in roaring which

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.330 
then we're going to put in roaring which
is<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.630> boon<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.169> release<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:27.919> want<00:04:28.130> and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
is the boon to release that we want and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.080 
is the boon to release that we want and
then<00:04:29.090> which<00:04:29.390> soon<00:04:29.690> uh-oh<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:31.130> forgot<00:04:31.430> that

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
then which soon uh-oh I forgot that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.770 
then which soon uh-oh I forgot that
roaring<00:04:32.390> doesn't<00:04:32.900> support<00:04:33.290> unity

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.210 

but<00:04:38.440> this<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.740> okay<00:04:39.100> we<00:04:39.310> can<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.550> install<00:04:40.300> I

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
but this is okay we can just install I

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
boot the Chromebook directly into Linux

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.340 
boot the Chromebook directly into Linux
so<00:05:53.919> here<00:05:54.250> is<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.580> nice<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.240> sleek<00:05:55.570> unity

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
so here is the nice and sleek unity

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.230 
so here is the nice and sleek unity
interface<00:05:56.979> it's<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.460> little<00:05:57.700> bit<00:05:57.820> slower

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
interface it's a little bit slower

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.540 
interface it's a little bit slower
because<00:05:58.780> this<00:05:59.140> only<00:05:59.320> has<00:05:59.560> an<00:05:59.740> ARM<00:05:59.919> processor

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
because this only has an ARM processor

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.240 
because this only has an ARM processor
but<00:06:00.789> it<00:06:00.880> works<00:06:01.090> great<00:06:01.450> so<00:06:01.720> yeah<00:06:02.560> that's<00:06:02.860> how<00:06:03.010> to

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
but it works great so yeah that's how to

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.400 
but it works great so yeah that's how to
install<00:06:03.460> Linux<00:06:04.000> onto<00:06:04.660> your<00:06:04.840> Chromebook<00:06:05.260> I
