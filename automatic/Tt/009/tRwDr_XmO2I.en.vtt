00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
you know I've worked with my teachers to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.540 
you know I've worked with my teachers to
make<00:00:39.320> sure<00:00:39.469> that<00:00:39.620> I<00:00:39.710> understood<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.430> material

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
make sure that I understood the material

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.569 
make sure that I understood the material
I<00:00:41.149> had<00:00:42.079> study<00:00:42.379> groups<00:00:42.710> at<00:00:42.950> sort<00:00:43.219> of<00:00:43.280> friends

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
I had study groups at sort of friends

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.740 
I had study groups at sort of friends
that<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:43.730> knew<00:00:43.910> were<00:00:44.090> good<00:00:44.300> at<00:00:44.450> certain<00:00:44.629> things

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
that I knew were good at certain things

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.660 
that I knew were good at certain things
so<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.500> would<00:00:45.649> rely<00:00:45.950> on<00:00:46.129> them<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.520> say

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
so that I would rely on them and say

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.119 
so that I would rely on them and say
could<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:46.910> work<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:47.270> me<00:00:47.480> after<00:00:47.719> school<00:00:48.129> and

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
could you work with me after school and

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.690 
could you work with me after school and
then<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:49.850> know<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:50.090> I<00:00:50.620> went<00:00:51.620> home<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.100> did

then you know I just I went home and did

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.580 
then you know I just I went home and did
homework<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:53.840> order<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.170> prepare<00:00:54.559> for

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
homework and in order to prepare for

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.560 
homework and in order to prepare for
tests<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.219> wrote<00:00:55.579> test<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.090> i<00:00:56.120> guess<00:00:56.329> i<00:00:56.449> was

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
tests I wrote test so i guess i was

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.029 
tests I wrote test so i guess i was
preparing<00:00:56.899> myself<00:00:57.110> for<00:00:57.379> being<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.829> teacher

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
preparing myself for being a teacher

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.500 
preparing myself for being a teacher
wait<00:00:58.879> on<00:00:59.449> him<00:00:59.660> later<00:01:01.000> well<00:01:02.000> yeah<00:01:02.149> i<00:01:02.180> was<00:01:02.480> just

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
it took me a while to build a budding in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.440 
it took me a while to build a budding in
high<00:01:15.979> school<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.490> just<00:01:16.700> wasn't<00:01:17.119> there<00:01:17.270> I'd

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
high school it just wasn't there I'd

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.690 
high school it just wasn't there I'd
really<00:01:17.869> developed<00:01:18.290> into<00:01:19.009> a<00:01:19.040> really<00:01:19.549> good

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
really developed into a really good

I<00:01:22.369> got<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.759> college<00:01:22.790> okay<00:01:23.659> um<00:01:24.159> can<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.280> think

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
I got to college okay um can you think

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.170 
I got to college okay um can you think
about<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.820> time<00:01:26.270> back<00:01:26.689> in<00:01:27.700> high<00:01:28.700> school<00:01:28.729> middle

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
about a time back in high school middle

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.170 
about a time back in high school middle
school<00:01:29.299> over<00:01:29.720> school<00:01:29.990> when<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.909> faced<00:01:31.909> an

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
school over school when you faced an

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.120 
school over school when you faced an
obstacle<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.229> really<00:01:33.439> hard<00:01:33.619> office<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.979> line

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
obstacle the really hard office of line

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.499 
obstacle the really hard office of line
you<00:01:34.250> overcame<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.939> I<00:01:35.770> would<00:01:36.770> say<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:40.509> remember

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
you overcame it I would say I remember

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.929 
you overcame it I would say I remember
there<00:01:42.020> were<00:01:42.170> two<00:01:42.439> classes<00:01:43.130> in<00:01:43.159> particular

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
there were two classes in particular

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.859 
there were two classes in particular
that<00:01:44.259> we're<00:01:45.259> challenging<00:01:45.950> for<00:01:46.250> me<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.869> in

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
that we're challenging for me and in

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.920 
that we're challenging for me and in
this<00:01:48.439> because<00:01:48.829> I<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.970> couldn't<00:01:50.210> understand

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
this because I just couldn't understand

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.450 
this because I just couldn't understand
and<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:52.329> chemistry<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:53.479> physics<00:01:53.840> no<00:01:54.710> lying<00:01:55.250> to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
and if chemistry and physics no lying to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.109 
and if chemistry and physics no lying to
you<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:55.729> wanted<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:56.720> an<00:01:57.409> engineer<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.850> wanted

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
you I wanted to be an engineer I wanted

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.240 
you I wanted to be an engineer I wanted
to<00:01:59.180> be<00:01:59.299> an<00:01:59.360> electrical<00:01:59.810> engineer<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.219> I

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
to be an electrical engineer and so I

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.859 
to be an electrical engineer and so I
had<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.549> figure<00:02:01.820> out<00:02:02.000> how<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.360> do<00:02:03.009> physics<00:02:04.009> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
had to figure out how to do physics and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.319 
had to figure out how to do physics and
it's<00:02:05.869> just<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.560> couldn't<00:02:07.250> figure<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.880> out<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:08.269> I

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
it's just I couldn't figure it out but I

school every day
the<00:02:11.760> chemistry<00:02:12.060> teacher<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.840> got<00:02:13.740> as<00:02:13.920> much

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the chemistry teacher and got as much

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.070 
the chemistry teacher and got as much
support<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.820> could<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.450> there<00:02:15.690> were<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> lot

say<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.420> understand<00:02:22.170> chemistry<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:23.070> whole

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
say that I understand chemistry I whole

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.150 
say that I understand chemistry I whole
beez<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.450> class<00:02:24.780> same<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> physics

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
beez in the class same thing of physics

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.670 
beez in the class same thing of physics
I<00:02:26.310> don't<00:02:26.610> understand<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.390> all<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.560> know

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I don't understand it at all you know

even though i don't understand i do i

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.260 
even though i don't understand i do i
definitely<00:02:35.100> developed<00:02:35.460> an<00:02:35.550> appreciation<00:02:35.790> for

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
definitely developed an appreciation for
