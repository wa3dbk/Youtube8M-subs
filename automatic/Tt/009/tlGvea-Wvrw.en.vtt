in the comments section below and let me

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
know why you think they're the best by
all<00:00:31.830> means<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.160> ahead<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
all means go ahead and do that but

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
all means go ahead and do that but
anyway<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.899> no<00:00:34.410> particular<00:00:34.559> order<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> my

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
anyway in no particular order this is my

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.139 
anyway in no particular order this is my
top<00:00:36.180> 5<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:37.980> gun<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.430> list<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
top 5 so the first gun on my list is the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.979 
top 5 so the first gun on my list is the
mp7

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
mp7

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.810 
mp7
now<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> gun<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.309> started<00:00:41.700> using

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
now this is a gun that I started using

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
now this is a gun that I started using
very<00:00:42.180> early<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.930> black<00:00:43.110> ops<00:00:43.320> 2<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.890> I've

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
very early on in black ops 2 and I've

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
very early on in black ops 2 and I've
used<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.780> through<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.440> love<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
used it all the way through I love the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
used it all the way through I love the
way<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> looks<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.610> love<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> way<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> sounds<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
way it looks I love the way it sounds I

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
way it looks I love the way it sounds I
always<00:00:49.770> perform<00:00:49.950> pretty<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
always perform pretty well with this so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.340 
always perform pretty well with this so
this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.210> probably<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> reasons<00:00:52.140> why

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
this is probably one of the reasons why

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
this is probably one of the reasons why
I've<00:00:52.469> used<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> gun<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.760> much<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> why<00:00:54.329> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I've used this gun so much and why it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
I've used this gun so much and why it's
made<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> onto<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.050> list<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.890> mean<00:00:56.070> some

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
made it onto this list but I mean some

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
made it onto this list but I mean some
of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> characteristics<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.210> make<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.600> good

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
of the characteristics that make my good

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
of the characteristics that make my good
is<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> fast<00:00:58.559> movement<00:00:59.070> speed<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is it's got the fast movement speed it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
is it's got the fast movement speed it's
got<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.030> magazine<00:01:00.210> size<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.530> accurate

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
got a good magazine size it's accurate

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.700 
got a good magazine size it's accurate
so<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.460> reasonably<00:01:02.879> low<00:01:03.090> recoil<00:01:03.710> it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so it's got reasonably low recoil it's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.320 
so it's got reasonably low recoil it's
not<00:01:04.860> clean<00:01:05.159> iron<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> use

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
not clean iron so you don't have to use

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
not clean iron so you don't have to use
an<00:01:06.479> optic<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.290> save<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> your

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
an optic so you can save one of your

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
an optic so you can save one of your
points<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.549> building<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.270> class<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.930> like

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
points for building your class and like

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
points for building your class and like
I<00:01:10.439> said<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> always<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.369> well<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.540> one

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I said I always do well with this so one

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
I said I always do well with this so one
of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> standard<00:01:13.140> classes<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.860> when

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
of the standard classes I use when

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
of the standard classes I use when
running<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> mp7<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> silencer<00:01:15.810> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
running the mp7 is a silencer I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
running the mp7 is a silencer I
generally<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.799> fast<00:01:17.189> mags<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.299> laser

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
generally have fast mags and the laser

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
generally have fast mags and the laser
sight<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:19.830> perks<00:01:20.130> I'll<00:01:20.520> usually<00:01:20.820> run

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
sight and for my perks I'll usually run

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.289 
sight and for my perks I'll usually run
ghost<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.560> hardline<00:01:23.119> toughness<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
ghost and hardline toughness and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
ghost and hardline toughness and
dexterity<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.170> you'll<00:01:25.350> find<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> toughness

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
dexterity now you'll find that toughness

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
dexterity now you'll find that toughness
and<00:01:26.580> dexterity<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.330> probably<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:27.900> perks

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and dexterity are probably the two perks

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
and dexterity are probably the two perks
that<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> run<00:01:28.740> most<00:01:29.250> often<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.329> been

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that I run most often but I have been

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
that I run most often but I have been
mixing<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> blue<00:01:31.320> category<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.920> a

mixing it up in the blue category with a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.410

couple of different other perks such as

using<00:01:39.659> recently<00:01:40.049> since<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> patch<00:01:40.979> they

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
using recently since the patch they

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.160 
using recently since the patch they
buffed<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.360> bit<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
buffed it a little bit one of the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.319 
buffed it a little bit one of the
reasons<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.860> gun<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.490> again<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> do

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

very<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.560> clean<00:01:46.950> irons<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
very well with it it's got clean irons I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
very well with it it's got clean irons I
always<00:01:48.420> run<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.810> gun<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> silencer<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
always run this gun with the silencer I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.469 
always run this gun with the silencer I
think<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.729> experience<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
think it's just my first experience that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
think it's just my first experience that
I've<00:01:51.689> picked<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> ground<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
I've picked it up off the ground and a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.219 
I've picked it up off the ground and a
silencer<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> looks<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
silencer and it just it looks and it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
silencer and it just it looks and it
sounds<00:01:55.590> nasty<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:57.030> high

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
sounds nasty because of that really high

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.810 
sounds nasty because of that really high
fast<00:01:57.750> rate<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> fire<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> silencer

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
fast rate of fire so with the silencer

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.880 
fast rate of fire so with the silencer
on<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.509> looks<00:02:00.540> nasty<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:01.770> with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
on it just it looks nasty I do well with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
on it just it looks nasty I do well with
it<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:02.250> low<00:02:02.460> recoil<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.840> performs

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it it's got low recoil so it performs

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.230 
it it's got low recoil so it performs
well<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.829> close<00:02:05.100> range<00:02:05.399> because<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.939> fast

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
well in close range because of that fast

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.330 
well in close range because of that fast
rate<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> fire<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.439> performs<00:02:07.860> quite<00:02:08.069> well

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
rate of fire it also performs quite well

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.999 
rate of fire it also performs quite well
at<00:02:08.459> long<00:02:08.610> range

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
at long range

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.130 
at long range
because<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> low<00:02:09.640> recoil<00:02:09.879> now<00:02:10.629> like<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.899> said<00:02:10.959> I

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
because the low recoil now like I said I

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
because the low recoil now like I said I
always<00:02:11.379> run<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.739> gun<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.129> silencer

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
always run this gun with a silencer

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.940 
always run this gun with a silencer
I<00:02:12.939> generally<00:02:13.420> run<00:02:13.780> fast<00:02:14.110> mags<00:02:14.379> with<00:02:14.650> all<00:02:14.829> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
I generally run fast mags with all the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.440 
I generally run fast mags with all the
assault<00:02:15.220> rifles<00:02:15.579> just<00:02:15.790> because<00:02:16.060> they<00:02:16.209> have

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
assault rifles just because they have

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.110 
assault rifles just because they have
the<00:02:16.659> smaller<00:02:17.079> clip<00:02:17.379> size<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.400> reloading

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the smaller clip size and the reloading

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.990 
the smaller clip size and the reloading
takes<00:02:19.599> ages<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:21.099> generally<00:02:21.489> always<00:02:21.700> run

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
takes ages and I generally always run

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.610 
takes ages and I generally always run
stock<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.689> assault<00:02:22.900> rifles<00:02:23.290> as<00:02:23.439> well

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
stock on the assault rifles as well

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.229 
stock on the assault rifles as well
because<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.519> that<00:02:24.670> faster

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
because I like to have that faster

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.869 
because I like to have that faster
movement<00:02:25.720> speed<00:02:25.989> while<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.739> sights<00:02:27.099> now

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
movement speed while and down sights now

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.789 
movement speed while and down sights now
with<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> type<00:02:28.360> 25<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:29.079> pretty<00:02:29.379> much<00:02:29.560> always

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
with the type 25 I pretty much always

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.949 
with the type 25 I pretty much always
run<00:02:30.159> hardline<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.940> that's<00:02:31.390> because<00:02:31.659> I<00:02:31.780> play

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
run hardline and that's because I play

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.360 
run hardline and that's because I play
an<00:02:32.019> awful<00:02:32.170> lot<00:02:32.379> of<00:02:32.409> Kill<00:02:32.680> Confirmed

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
an awful lot of Kill Confirmed

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
an awful lot of Kill Confirmed
I<00:02:33.400> run<00:02:33.700> toughness<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> also<00:02:34.690> run<00:02:35.019> usually

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
awareness as well it's not an amazing

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.979

perk<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> good<00:02:40.329> headset<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.900> is

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
perk but with a good headset it is

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.020

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
next gun on my list is the SMR this is a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
next gun on my list is the SMR this is a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
gun that I remember when the game first

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.559 
gun that I remember when the game first
came<00:02:47.620> out<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.010> saw<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.579> a<00:02:48.639> lot<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.120> bigger

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
came out I saw that a lot of the bigger

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.750 
came out I saw that a lot of the bigger
youtubers<00:02:50.139> like<00:02:50.170> seananners<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:50.950> functional

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
youtubers like seananners and functional

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.849 
youtubers like seananners and functional
deck<00:02:51.940> when<00:02:52.269> using<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.959> their<00:02:53.200> kill<00:02:53.680> death

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
deck when using it and their kill death

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.190 
deck when using it and their kill death
ratio<00:02:53.920> was<00:02:54.400> quite<00:02:54.639> high<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:55.569> thought<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.109> was

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
ratio was quite high I thought it was

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.839 
ratio was quite high I thought it was
interesting<00:02:56.590> because<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.190> fictional<00:02:57.639> gun

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
interesting because it's a fictional gun

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.849 
interesting because it's a fictional gun
I<00:02:58.060> think<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.480> looks<00:02:58.629> pretty<00:02:58.780> cool<00:02:59.139> and<00:02:59.349> some<00:02:59.799> of

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
I think it looks pretty cool and some of

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.199 
I think it looks pretty cool and some of
the<00:02:59.920> things<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.370> about<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.120> very

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
the things I like about it is it's very

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.420 
the things I like about it is it's very
very<00:03:01.540> powerful<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.349> has<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.620> two<00:03:02.950> shot<00:03:02.980> kill

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
very powerful it has a two shot kill

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.879 
very powerful it has a two shot kill
range<00:03:03.459> which<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:04.840> ridiculously<00:03:05.650> long

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
range which is just ridiculously long

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.039 
range which is just ridiculously long
even<00:03:06.280> longer<00:03:06.459> than<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> foul<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.629> not<00:03:07.840> often

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
even longer than the foul it's not often

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.420 
even longer than the foul it's not often
seen<00:03:08.319> as<00:03:08.500> well<00:03:08.650> which<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:08.859> something<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.310> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
seen as well which is something that I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.920 
seen as well which is something that I
like<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.849> this<00:03:10.090> weapon<00:03:10.420> you'll<00:03:10.540> find<00:03:10.810> that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
like about this weapon you'll find that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.149 
like about this weapon you'll find that
there's<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.139> couple<00:03:11.409> of<00:03:11.470> guns<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:11.889> list

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
there's a couple of guns in this list

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.670 
there's a couple of guns in this list
that<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.430> use<00:03:12.849> because<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.959> don't<00:03:14.199> see<00:03:14.440> them<00:03:14.590> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
that I use because I don't see them a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.460 
that I use because I don't see them a
lot<00:03:14.859> in<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.750> multiplayer<00:03:16.750> lobbies<00:03:17.139> I<00:03:17.290> don't

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
lot in the multiplayer lobbies I don't

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.140 
lot in the multiplayer lobbies I don't
really<00:03:17.739> know<00:03:17.949> why<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.579> makes<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.940> gun

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
really know why that makes a gun

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.119 
really know why that makes a gun
attractive<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.959> me<00:03:20.139> but<00:03:20.500> yeah<00:03:20.980> that's

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
attractive to me but yeah that's

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.289 
attractive to me but yeah that's
definitely<00:03:21.609> something<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> find

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
definitely something that I find

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.270 
definitely something that I find
appealing<00:03:22.660> which<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.109> kind<00:03:23.319> of<00:03:23.379> weird<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.129> with

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
appealing which is kind of weird so with

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.580 
appealing which is kind of weird so with
the<00:03:24.370> SMR<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.329> very<00:03:25.569> specific<00:03:25.810> class<00:03:26.319> and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
the SMR I have a very specific class and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.289 
the SMR I have a very specific class and
I<00:03:26.620> never<00:03:26.919> change<00:03:27.250> that's<00:03:27.730> always<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.150> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
I never change that's always with the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.050 
I never change that's always with the
red<00:03:28.480> dot<00:03:28.720> select<00:03:29.440> fire<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.980> stock<00:03:30.310> with<00:03:30.970> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
red dot select fire and stock with the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.569 
red dot select fire and stock with the
SMR<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:31.599> mix<00:03:32.049> up<00:03:32.199> the<00:03:32.379> perks<00:03:32.620> quite<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> fair<00:03:33.340> bit

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
SMR I mix up the perks quite a fair bit

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.150 
SMR I mix up the perks quite a fair bit
but<00:03:34.480> as<00:03:34.660> usual<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.230> common<00:03:35.530> ones<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.889> I<00:03:35.919> use

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
but as usual the common ones that I use

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.830 
but as usual the common ones that I use
a<00:03:36.190> hard-line<00:03:36.760> toughness<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.510> dexterity

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
a hard-line toughness and dexterity

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.080 
a hard-line toughness and dexterity
toughness<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> really<00:03:39.099> important<00:03:39.790> one<00:03:39.879> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
toughness is a really important one to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.729 
toughness is a really important one to
run<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.299> think<00:03:40.449> with<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.780> SMR<00:03:41.199> because<00:03:41.590> you

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
run I think with the SMR because you

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.309 
run I think with the SMR because you
only<00:03:41.919> have<00:03:42.250> 20<00:03:42.879> rounds<00:03:43.209> in<00:03:43.299> your<00:03:43.419> magazine<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
only have 20 rounds in your magazine and

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.979 
only have 20 rounds in your magazine and
it<00:03:44.919> only<00:03:45.370> needs<00:03:45.639> two<00:03:45.879> shots<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.299> kill<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.780> it's

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
it only needs two shots to kill so it's

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.020 
it only needs two shots to kill so it's
it's<00:03:47.560> really<00:03:47.859> important<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.549> your<00:03:48.699> shots

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
it's really important that your shots

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.670 
it's really important that your shots
stay<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.419> target<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.049> if<00:03:50.109> you're<00:03:50.260> receiving

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
stay on target so if you're receiving

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.409 
stay on target so if you're receiving
fire<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.129> get<00:03:51.280> knocked<00:03:51.519> off<00:03:51.699> target<00:03:52.180> that

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
fire and get knocked off target that

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.869 
fire and get knocked off target that
really<00:03:52.599> hampers<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.049> SMS<00:03:53.409> performance<00:03:53.980> so

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
really hampers the SMS performance so

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.670 
really hampers the SMS performance so
the<00:03:54.970> next<00:03:55.150> weapon<00:03:55.449> in<00:03:55.569> my<00:03:55.690> top<00:03:55.900> 5<00:03:56.169> is<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
the next weapon in my top 5 is the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.500 
the next weapon in my top 5 is the
Peacekeeper<00:03:57.430> now<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.760> know<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.389> a<00:03:58.480> couple

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
Peacekeeper now I know that in a couple

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.509 
Peacekeeper now I know that in a couple
of<00:03:58.780> videos<00:03:59.109> ago<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.620> said<00:03:59.919> that<00:04:00.069> I<00:04:00.099> didn't

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
of videos ago that I said that I didn't

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.430 
of videos ago that I said that I didn't
like<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.150> Peacekeeper<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.930> was

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
like the the Peacekeeper that I was

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.439 
like the the Peacekeeper that I was
never<00:04:02.590> able<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.949> do<00:04:03.190> well<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:03.579> it<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:04.299> that

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
never able to do well with it and that

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.119 
never able to do well with it and that
has<00:04:04.569> since<00:04:04.690> changed<00:04:04.810> I've<00:04:05.500> been<00:04:05.530> using<00:04:05.859> it<00:04:06.069> a

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
has since changed I've been using it a

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.920 
has since changed I've been using it a
fair<00:04:06.310> bit<00:04:06.459> recently<00:04:06.669> and<00:04:07.479> I<00:04:07.629> think<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.870> figured

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
fair bit recently and I think I figured

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.839 
fair bit recently and I think I figured
out<00:04:08.229> a<00:04:08.290> good<00:04:08.560> strategy<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.040> how<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.310> use<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.669> I

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
out a good strategy and how to use it I

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.780 
out a good strategy and how to use it I
was<00:04:10.720> using<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.079> very<00:04:11.109> much<00:04:11.409> like<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.620> normal<00:04:11.889> SMG

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
was using it very much like a normal SMG

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.399 
was using it very much like a normal SMG
and<00:04:12.940> getting<00:04:13.150> up<00:04:13.269> close<00:04:13.629> in<00:04:13.840> people's<00:04:14.169> faces

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
and getting up close in people's faces

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.439 
and getting up close in people's faces
and<00:04:14.799> then<00:04:14.979> it's<00:04:15.129> definitely<00:04:15.389> not<00:04:16.389> the

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
and then it's definitely not the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.659 
and then it's definitely not the
peacekeepers<00:04:17.289> strength<00:04:17.859> you'll<00:04:18.219> get<00:04:18.430> killed

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
peacekeepers strength you'll get killed

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.460 
peacekeepers strength you'll get killed
nine<00:04:19.120> times<00:04:19.389> out<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.599> ten<00:04:19.870> if<00:04:20.139> you

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
nine times out of ten if you

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.780 
nine times out of ten if you
that's<00:04:20.709> strategy<00:04:20.920> with<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.310> Peacekeeper

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
that's strategy with the Peacekeeper

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.340 
that's strategy with the Peacekeeper
it's<00:04:22.000> all<00:04:22.120> about<00:04:22.330> fast<00:04:22.660> movement<00:04:23.110> speed

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
it's all about fast movement speed

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's all about fast movement speed
keeping<00:04:24.100> your<00:04:24.190> enemy<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.610> distance<00:04:24.970> but

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
keeping your enemy in a distance but

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.270 
keeping your enemy in a distance but
when<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.690> do<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.500> very<00:04:26.800> very<00:04:27.010> powerful

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
when you do that it's very very powerful

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.400 
when you do that it's very very powerful
so<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.330> said<00:04:28.510> it's<00:04:28.660> got<00:04:28.750> fast<00:04:28.990> movement

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
so like I said it's got fast movement

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.170 
so like I said it's got fast movement
speed<00:04:29.620> it's<00:04:29.770> got<00:04:29.920> those<00:04:30.040> clean<00:04:30.520> ions<00:04:30.970> which

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
speed it's got those clean ions which

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.120 
speed it's got those clean ions which
means<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.660> you<00:04:31.780> don't<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.200> worry<00:04:33.040> about

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
means that you don't have to worry about

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.550 
means that you don't have to worry about
an<00:04:33.340> optic<00:04:33.670> it's<00:04:34.360> hella<00:04:34.720> accurate<00:04:35.260> it's<00:04:35.410> got

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
an optic it's hella accurate it's got

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.110 
an optic it's hella accurate it's got
reasonably<00:04:35.980> low<00:04:36.160> recoil<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:36.820> it's<00:04:36.970> pretty

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
reasonably low recoil so it's pretty

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.640 
reasonably low recoil so it's pretty
accurate<00:04:37.390> out<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.230> long<00:04:38.440> distance

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
accurate out to a very long distance

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.380 
accurate out to a very long distance
it's<00:04:39.070> got<00:04:39.220> better<00:04:39.430> long-range<00:04:39.820> than<00:04:40.060> some<00:04:40.270> of

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
it's got better long-range than some of

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.720 
it's got better long-range than some of
the<00:04:40.540> assault<00:04:41.140> rifles<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:41.800> it's<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.700> very

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
the assault rifles so it's a it's a very

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.090 
the assault rifles so it's a it's a very
cool<00:04:43.060> weapon<00:04:43.480> now<00:04:44.110> in<00:04:44.230> terms<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.530> attachments

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
cool weapon now in terms of attachments

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.440 
cool weapon now in terms of attachments
you're<00:04:45.250> probably<00:04:45.580> beginning<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:46.030> see<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> trend

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
you're probably beginning to see a trend

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.860 
you're probably beginning to see a trend
here<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.050> often<00:04:47.980> run<00:04:48.130> silencer<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.600> prefer

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
here I often run silencer I just prefer

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.990 
here I often run silencer I just prefer
to<00:04:49.900> be<00:04:50.050> stealthy<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.950> map<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.400> generally

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
to be stealthy on the map I generally

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.460 
to be stealthy on the map I generally
always<00:04:52.210> run<00:04:52.480> fast<00:04:52.780> mags<00:04:53.050> with<00:04:53.350> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
always run fast mags with the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.780 
always run fast mags with the
peacekeeper<00:04:53.920> because<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.490> smaller

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
peacekeeper because of the smaller

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.240 
peacekeeper because of the smaller
magazine<00:04:55.000> size<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.650> generally<00:04:56.980> run<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
magazine size and I generally run the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.190 
magazine size and I generally run the
quick-draw<00:04:57.520> handle<00:04:57.760> as<00:04:58.360> well<00:04:58.390> so<00:04:58.870> I've<00:04:59.020> got

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
quick-draw handle as well so I've got

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.950 
quick-draw handle as well so I've got
that<00:04:59.350> faster<00:04:59.890> 80s<00:05:00.760> speed<00:05:01.120> now<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
that faster 80s speed now with the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.630 
that faster 80s speed now with the
peacekeeper<00:05:02.590> I've<00:05:03.100> been<00:05:03.280> trying<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.610> whole

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
peacekeeper I've been trying a whole

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.520 
peacekeeper I've been trying a whole
bunch<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:04.000> different<00:05:04.270> classes<00:05:04.450> recently<00:05:05.260> at

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
bunch of different classes recently at

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.050 
bunch of different classes recently at
the<00:05:05.650> moment<00:05:06.040> I'm<00:05:06.160> running<00:05:06.460> ghost<00:05:06.760> and

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
the moment I'm running ghost and

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.600 
the moment I'm running ghost and
hardline<00:05:07.630> with<00:05:07.870> toughness<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:09.100> awareness

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
hardline with toughness and awareness

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.340 
hardline with toughness and awareness
which<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:09.880> kind<00:05:10.270> of<00:05:10.330> like<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.540> super<00:05:10.990> stealth

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
which is kind of like a super stealth

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.620 
which is kind of like a super stealth
class<00:05:11.919> with<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.610> awareness<00:05:12.790> thing<00:05:13.210> so<00:05:13.390> I<00:05:13.419> can

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
class with the awareness thing so I can

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.750 
class with the awareness thing so I can
sound<00:05:13.840> for<00:05:14.230> now<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.040> last<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.640> definitely

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
sound for now the last and definitely

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.940 
sound for now the last and definitely
not<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.330> least<00:05:16.540> weapon<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.140> my<00:05:17.320> list<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.800> the

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
not the least weapon in my list is the

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.550 
not the least weapon in my list is the
cheek<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.370> with<00:05:18.669> CQB<00:05:19.180> or<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.750> chicken<00:05:20.110> as<00:05:20.320> some

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
cheek on with CQB or the chicken as some

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.830 
cheek on with CQB or the chicken as some
people<00:05:20.800> in<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:20.950> community<00:05:21.070> call<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.780> this<00:05:22.780> is

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
people in the community call it this is

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.680 
people in the community call it this is
a<00:05:23.050> unusual<00:05:23.710> gun<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.400> I've<00:05:24.669> had<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> torrid<00:05:25.480> love

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
a unusual gun and I've had a torrid love

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.810 
a unusual gun and I've had a torrid love
affair<00:05:25.720> with<00:05:26.140> its<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:26.560> go<00:05:27.040> through<00:05:27.280> stages<00:05:27.490> of

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
affair with its I go through stages of

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.250 
affair with its I go through stages of
loving<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.360> then<00:05:28.480> through<00:05:28.720> stages<00:05:28.990> of

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
loving it and then through stages of

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.170 
loving it and then through stages of
absolutely<00:05:29.740> eating<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:30.190> so<00:05:30.370> some<00:05:31.060> of<00:05:31.090> the

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
absolutely eating it so some of the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.909 
absolutely eating it so some of the
characteristics<00:05:31.510> I<00:05:31.930> like<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.410> cheek<00:05:32.590> on<00:05:32.740> is

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
characteristics I like the cheek on is

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.310 
characteristics I like the cheek on is
the<00:05:33.100> ridiculously<00:05:33.790> fast<00:05:34.120> rate<00:05:34.450> of<00:05:34.480> fire<00:05:34.600> it's

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
the ridiculously fast rate of fire it's

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.719 
the ridiculously fast rate of fire it's
pretty<00:05:35.650> accurate<00:05:35.860> it's<00:05:36.220> got<00:05:36.340> pretty<00:05:36.490> low

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
pretty accurate it's got pretty low

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.810 
pretty accurate it's got pretty low
recoil<00:05:36.970> and<00:05:37.479> I<00:05:37.900> don't<00:05:38.320> think<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.979> it<00:05:39.160> has<00:05:39.430> a

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
recoil and I don't think that it has a

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.370 
recoil and I don't think that it has a
limit<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.300> how<00:05:40.330> fast<00:05:40.720> you<00:05:40.990> can<00:05:41.140> pull<00:05:41.290> the

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
limit to how fast you can pull the

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.350 
limit to how fast you can pull the
trigger<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:41.919> so<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.550> attachments<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.090> I<00:05:43.120> run

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
trigger so so the attachments that I run

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.590 
trigger so so the attachments that I run
with<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.570> cheek<00:05:43.750> on<00:05:43.900> fast<00:05:44.620> mags<00:05:44.950> and

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
with the cheek on fast mags and

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.760 
with the cheek on fast mags and
generally<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.660> run<00:05:46.990> an<00:05:47.110> optic<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.590> don't

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
generally I run an optic I don't

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.340 
generally I run an optic I don't
actually<00:05:47.860> mind<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.960> ions<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.140> think

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
actually mind the the ions I think

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.140 
actually mind the the ions I think
they're<00:05:50.560> they're<00:05:50.860> not<00:05:50.979> too<00:05:51.280> bad<00:05:51.520> but<00:05:52.090> the

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
they're they're not too bad but the

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.480 
they're they're not too bad but the
optic<00:05:52.720> definitely<00:05:53.110> helps<00:05:53.410> with<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:54.010> with<00:05:54.400> the

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
optic definitely helps with the with the

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.909 
optic definitely helps with the with the
accuracy<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.450> even<00:05:55.900> though<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.320> silencer

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
accuracy and even though the silencer

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.640 
accuracy and even though the silencer
does<00:05:57.100> reduce<00:05:57.490> its<00:05:57.700> range<00:05:58.090> and<00:05:59.020> is<00:05:59.140> not<00:05:59.350> often

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
does reduce its range and is not often

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.070 
does reduce its range and is not often
the<00:05:59.800> best<00:06:00.130> choice<00:06:00.250> again<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.390> will<00:06:01.570> often<00:06:01.750> run<00:06:02.020> a

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
the best choice again I will often run a

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.219 
the best choice again I will often run a
silencer<00:06:02.560> on<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.770> cheek<00:06:02.979> on<00:06:03.190> because

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
silencer on the cheek on because

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.480 
silencer on the cheek on because
strangely<00:06:05.229> I<00:06:05.260> think<00:06:05.650> it<00:06:05.770> looks<00:06:05.950> awesome<00:06:06.340> and
