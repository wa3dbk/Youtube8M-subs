00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.890
 there is a future 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.809

 of assholes there is no other way to 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.149
 rate the boys since we're 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.090
 giving a journalistic note where 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.220
 we mark pure information that they want 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.440
 that is done with a photo with a lid on 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.119
 white nothing else with the title I have to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.369
 recreate a photo material now by 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.320

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.050

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.670
 exact I do not lie the source certain of 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.920
 files that respond to see if it 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.590
 they found vain aside some one to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.149
 tell zaira nara twitter and it would be 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.979
 good to know that they are using a 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.929
 photo of two years ago to tell a 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 story that never happened a 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.970
 present that is a lie 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.760
 the risks of fresh good humor 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590

 opportunity to which God has glory 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.800

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.420
 American and I told him how you look at me 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.990
 the author 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.689
 other than the heron soda if it was missing to know 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.310
 something about the doctor accused of abuse 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.319
 listen to this testimony and take out 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.319
 doubts words from your brain 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:19.610
 and if you buy the abuse combo and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.610
 take a link to the grattarola 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:40.920
 the guy tells me sorry he's not being 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:43.959
 charge was seen that lack of footbridge 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.239
 where the doctor's long hand makes a couple 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.239
 of the heron but some unique part 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:01.100
 nine years ago remember that makes 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.770
 exactly nine years May 25 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.070
 to his honey as president and I 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.070
 agreed 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.690
 I'm going to tell an anecdote we had to 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.150
 write with Carlos Zannini the speech 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.920
 that the new president was going to 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.810
 pronounce the next day but of course 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.300
 he wanted to read it before and when he read it 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.480
 He said this is crap 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 I do not read it, it does not say anything 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.950
 I said good what do you want me to say 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.040
 I think he strafed or shot because 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.750
 were ten or twelve ideas 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.670
 and they were after that written in that paper 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.280
 that he read the next day maybe some 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.220
 they will say fund forum others will say was the 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.140
 restructuring of debt other 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.290
 when he lowered the video frame another 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.760
 when the 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.880
 unconstitutionality of the laws of 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.290
 due obedience and final point 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.550
 others will say good the education law 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.620
 that which established 6% of the pbi 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.490
 destined education and I gather everything 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.260
 because it was the governments but it's a 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.160
 I only project this I want everyone to 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.290
 be very clear 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.580
 establish that our retirees who 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.410
 they had been forgotten for decades 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.180
 had their salary increases the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.100
 institute of the vital minimum wage and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.950
 mobile where they meet once a year and 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.370
 fix employers and state workers 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.920
 of tourism that exploded the villages 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.590
 originating the equal marriage the 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.290
 gender identity what do I know 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.290
 the things of all these things 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:53.379
 maybe the most important thing 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:55.680
 and returned to the Argentines the homeland 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:58.130
 that had been taken from him 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.130
 i 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.580
 well-known strategy and spent all right 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.580
 in charlotte but you invented a new 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.320
 mum nancy richard ford sold out the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.360
 move to say every two times three 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.410
 they are only interested in the luxury vein 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.770
 material and people as one is with 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.770
 we 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.020
 of the suitcases 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.130
 I still do not bring it to the paintings of 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:40.340
 the afternoon and you bought yourself just like everything 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:43.070
 just in case it's good that the shoes 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.990
 I do not understand anything but I 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.040
 I would dare to say that they are the shoes 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.040
 most beautiful I saw in my life 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:59.680
 health a question in about 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.680
 these shoes 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.940
 thousand euros 1,200 you go shopping 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:11.770
 little by little they are giving you away depends on the 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.770
 truth I almost every day 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.280
 you know it's a life totally 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.200
 different from the rest of the mortals who 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.880
 she made a life that many envy her 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.290
 obviously because almost all day 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.710
 plus a fantastic life all day with 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.710
 a poor 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.490
 with a cameraman I would not go out with the 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.490
 greengrocer
