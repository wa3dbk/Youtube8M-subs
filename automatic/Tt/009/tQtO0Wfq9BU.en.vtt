them would be lost really and the fact
that<00:01:12.240> he's<00:01:12.420> such<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.689> big<00:01:12.840> card<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.470> on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that he's such a big card it's going on

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
that he's such a big card it's going on
a<00:01:13.590> pay-per-view<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.189> suppose<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> toe<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a pay-per-view I suppose that toe you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.730 
a pay-per-view I suppose that toe you
know<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:15.869> down<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> promoters

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
know it's really down to the promoters

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
know it's really down to the promoters
but<00:01:16.890> suppose<00:01:17.100> that's<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> gets<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.869> hit

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
but suppose that's how it gets the hit

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.330 
but suppose that's how it gets the hit
you<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> add<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.860> mean<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.159> else

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you to add up because I mean how else

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.070 
you to add up because I mean how else
would<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> ever<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:20.820> seven<00:01:21.420> title<00:01:21.720> fights<00:01:21.930> on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
would you ever put seven title fights on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
would you ever put seven title fights on
one<00:01:22.259> card<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> unless<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
one card and unless it was a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.450 
one card and unless it was a
pay-per-view<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> mean<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> economic

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
pay-per-view so that I mean the economic

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
pay-per-view so that I mean the economic
side<00:01:26.610> without<00:01:26.850> fans<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> flowers<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
side without fans the flowers from a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
side without fans the flowers from a
butterfly<00:01:28.979> profile<00:01:29.430> point<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> view

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
butterfly profile point of view

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.010 
butterfly profile point of view
obviously<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.390> very<00:01:30.570> hard<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> be

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
obviously it's very hard to be

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
obviously it's very hard to be

where now it's done at the LG it's on a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.530 
where now it's done at the LG it's on a
massive<00:03:04.280> card<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.120> know<00:03:05.210> it's<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.420> main

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
massive card and you know it's the main

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.600 
massive card and you know it's the main
attraction<00:03:06.020> of<00:03:06.080> a<00:03:06.170> huge<00:03:06.380> card<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.890> it's<00:03:07.550> a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
attraction of a huge card and it's a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.980 
attraction of a huge card and it's a
much<00:03:07.760> bigger<00:03:07.940> fight<00:03:08.210> now<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.630> think<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
much bigger fight now so I think the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.930 
much bigger fight now so I think the
fact<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.380> 12<00:03:09.650> months<00:03:09.920> if<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.760> fact

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
fact that the 12 months if the fact

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.220 
fact that the 12 months if the fact
didn't<00:03:11.210> happen<00:03:11.450> 12<00:03:11.630> months<00:03:11.840> ago<00:03:11.960> I<00:03:12.050> think

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
didn't happen 12 months ago I think

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.270 
didn't happen 12 months ago I think
there's<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.410> good<00:03:12.530> thing<00:03:12.770> because<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.070> don't

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
there's a good thing because I don't

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.950
