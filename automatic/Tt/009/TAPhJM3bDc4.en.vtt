first<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.390> all<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.780> starts<00:01:48.380> with<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.800> Gnostic

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
first of all it starts with a Gnostic

you is your spirit the second step is
that<00:01:59.660> God<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.710> spirit<00:02:01.430> according<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> Word
