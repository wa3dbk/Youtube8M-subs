that<00:02:12.530> you're<00:02:12.650> going<00:02:12.950> for<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.459> tend<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.270> go<00:02:14.420> about

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
that you're going for I tend to go about

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.170 
that you're going for I tend to go about
2/3<00:02:15.140> up<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:15.709> if<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:16.670> doing<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.120> a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
2/3 up and then if I'm doing like a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180 
2/3 up and then if I'm doing like a
darker<00:02:17.780> color<00:02:17.989> over<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.350> lighter<00:02:18.590> color<00:02:18.920> I'll

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
darker color over a lighter color I'll

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.470 
darker color over a lighter color I'll
often<00:02:19.640> go<00:02:20.440> over<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> tips<00:02:21.799> again<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:23.150> create<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
often go over the tips again to create a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.420 
often go over the tips again to create a
bit<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.690> an<00:02:23.750> ombre<00:02:24.110> effect<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.830> polish<00:02:28.130> dries

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
bit of an ombre effect the polish dries

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.570 
bit of an ombre effect the polish dries
quite<00:02:28.790> quickly<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:31.100> obviously<00:02:31.250> you're

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
quite quickly because obviously you're

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.380 
quite quickly because obviously you're
only<00:02:31.700> dabbing<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.209> really<00:02:32.450> small<00:02:32.690> amount<00:02:32.870> on

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.270 

I<00:02:39.450> find<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.260> less<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.500> more<00:02:40.650> when<00:02:41.160> you're

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
I find that less is more when you're

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.460 
I find that less is more when you're
doing<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.550> molten<00:02:41.880> metal<00:02:42.150> color<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
doing a molten metal color like this and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.690 
doing a molten metal color like this and
there<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:46.130> really<00:02:47.130> quick<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.580> easy

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
there you go really quick and easy

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.220 
there you go really quick and easy
that's<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.270> whole<00:02:48.450> hand<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.870> straightaway

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that's the whole hand on straightaway

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.960 
that's the whole hand on straightaway
