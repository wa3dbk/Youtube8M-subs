00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
smart cover if i'm not mistaken i think

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.110 
smart cover if i'm not mistaken i think
the<00:02:41.640> edges<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.660> there's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.260> spot

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840 
the edges right here there's a spot
blank<00:02:45.120> area<00:02:45.630> right<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.920> smart

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
blank area right here that the smart

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.350 
blank area right here that the smart
cover<00:02:48.380> will<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.410> able<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.710> fit<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.610> that's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.080 
cover will be able to fit on and that's
only<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.720> 495<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.530> even<00:02:53.520> if<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> don't<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
only for 495 so even if you don't on the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.570 
only for 495 so even if you don't on the
smart<00:02:54.360> cover<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.530> don't<00:02:55.770> mind<00:02:55.980> not

having anything on the side right here

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.040 
having anything on the side right here
it'll<00:02:59.459> save<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.820> seven<00:03:00.120> bucks<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.690> don't<00:03:01.020> think

that<00:03:01.320> ships<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.680> prime<00:03:01.920> though<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.400> does
