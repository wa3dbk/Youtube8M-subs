rink at some point along the way you
know<00:00:32.559> we<00:00:32.770> decided<00:00:33.190> we'd<00:00:33.340> love<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.550> make<00:00:33.789> our

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
know we decided we'd love to make our

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.240 
know we decided we'd love to make our
own<00:00:34.059> snowboards<00:00:34.690> not<00:00:35.590> necessarily<00:00:36.129> as<00:00:36.219> a

own snowboards not necessarily as a
commercial<00:00:36.670> venture<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.120> just<00:00:37.270> for<00:00:37.390> fun<00:00:37.570> just

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
commercial venture but just for fun just

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.000 
commercial venture but just for fun just
because<00:00:37.989> there<00:00:38.649> wasn't<00:00:38.829> necessarily

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
because there wasn't necessarily

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.430 
because there wasn't necessarily
anything<00:00:39.790> out<00:00:39.910> there<00:00:40.060> that<00:00:40.260> portrayed<00:00:41.260> our

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
or the style of board that we liked so

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.310 
or the style of board that we liked so
we<00:00:45.790> acquired<00:00:46.239> oppress'd<00:00:46.660> acquired<00:00:47.050> some

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
we acquired oppress'd acquired some

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.220 
we acquired oppress'd acquired some
materials<00:00:47.770> and<00:00:47.950> built<00:00:48.730> our<00:00:48.880> first<00:00:49.120> board<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:50.020> a

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
materials and built our first board in a

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.580 
materials and built our first board in a
vacuum<00:00:50.890> press<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:52.540> basically<00:00:52.899> from<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.350> day

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
vacuum press and basically from that day

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.920 
vacuum press and basically from that day
on<00:00:53.800> I<00:00:54.160> decided<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:55.570> know<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.719> really

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
on I decided that you know I really

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830 
on I decided that you know I really
really<00:00:56.890> wanted<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.430> keep<00:00:58.090> building<00:00:58.360> boards

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
really wanted to keep building boards

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.720 
really wanted to keep building boards
and<00:00:59.110> potentially<00:00:59.710> pursue<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.520> as<00:01:00.640> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
and potentially pursue it as a

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.899 
and potentially pursue it as a
commercial<00:01:01.120> venture

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.240 

the<00:01:05.780> thing<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:05.990> makes<00:01:06.259> teamate<00:01:06.740> unique<00:01:07.070> is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
the thing that makes teamate unique is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.490 
the thing that makes teamate unique is
that<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.579> can<00:01:07.729> offer<00:01:07.880> custom<00:01:08.689> shaped<00:01:09.110> boards

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
that we can offer custom shaped boards

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.039 
that we can offer custom shaped boards
as<00:01:09.619> well<00:01:09.770> as<00:01:09.890> custom<00:01:10.250> graphics<00:01:10.869> there<00:01:11.869> have

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
as well as custom graphics there have

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.899 
as well as custom graphics there have
been<00:01:12.229> attempts<00:01:12.590> by<00:01:12.710> other<00:01:12.770> companies<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.520> sort

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
been attempts by other companies to sort

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.370 
been attempts by other companies to sort
of<00:01:13.970> do<00:01:14.119> one<00:01:14.329> or<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> other<00:01:14.689> but<00:01:14.899> not<00:01:14.960> really

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
of do one or the other but not really

combine<00:01:15.770> both<00:01:16.390> especially<00:01:17.390> at<00:01:17.659> an<00:01:17.750> affordable

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
combine both especially at an affordable

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.910 
combine both especially at an affordable
price<00:01:18.200> point<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:21.110> basically<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
price point so basically that the

versed in snowboarding and know exactly
what<00:01:25.819> they<00:01:25.880> want<00:01:26.179> maybe<00:01:26.420> they<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.720> board

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
what they want maybe they have a board

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.139 
what they want maybe they have a board
that<00:01:27.140> they<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:27.470> like<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.619> tweak<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> little

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
that they just like to tweak a little

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.819 
that they just like to tweak a little
they<00:01:29.149> can<00:01:29.299> log<00:01:29.450> in<00:01:29.659> online<00:01:29.810> log<00:01:30.500> into<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
they can log in online log into the

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.639 
they can log in online log into the
configurator<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.670> basically<00:01:32.659> design<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
configurator and basically design a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.499 
configurator and basically design a
board<00:01:34.009> exactly<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.970> specs<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.299> they

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
board exactly to the specs that they

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.270 
board exactly to the specs that they
want<00:01:35.720> down<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.619> know<00:01:36.740> submitting

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
want down to you know submitting

want down to you know submitting
graphics<00:01:37.840> for<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.959> beginner<00:01:39.319> that<00:01:39.560> may<00:01:39.830> know

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
graphics for the beginner that may know
