this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.080> ring<00:00:10.650> pellet<00:00:11.219> mold<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.150> makes

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
this is a ring pellet mold this makes

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
this is a ring pellet mold this makes
ring<00:00:13.170> pellets<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.130> place<00:00:14.309> inside

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
ring pellets that you can place inside

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
ring pellets that you can place inside
of<00:00:14.790> your<00:00:15.030> rings<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.960> control<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> shrinkage

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
of your rings to control the shrinkage

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.929 
of your rings to control the shrinkage
during<00:00:17.220> firing<00:00:17.900> it's<00:00:18.900> really<00:00:19.199> simple<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.740> use

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
during firing it's really simple to use

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.060 
during firing it's really simple to use
what<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.060> gonna<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.960> mix<00:00:22.230> up<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
what we're gonna do is first mix up the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.580 
what we're gonna do is first mix up the
ultra-smooth<00:00:23.939> investment<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.170> water<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
ultra-smooth investment the water is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
ultra-smooth investment the water is
already<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> container<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:26.849> adding

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
already in the container and I'm adding

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.110 
already in the container and I'm adding
my<00:00:27.510> investment<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.680> use<00:00:31.009> exactly<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.820> amount

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
my investment I use exactly the amount

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
my investment I use exactly the amount
that<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> says<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> instructions<00:00:34.350> that's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that it says in the instructions that's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.290 
that it says in the instructions that's
very<00:00:35.309> important<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> follow<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
very important to follow the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.280 
very important to follow the
instructions<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.370> mix<00:00:40.910> and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
instructions and then you just mix and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.029 
instructions and then you just mix and
pour<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> cavities<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.840> takes<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.350> 15

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
pour into the cavities it takes about 15

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.910 
pour into the cavities it takes about 15
or<00:00:47.399> 20<00:00:47.430> minutes<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.230> depends<00:00:49.800> on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
or 20 minutes and then this depends on

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
or 20 minutes and then this depends on
the<00:00:50.730> humidity<00:00:51.480> where<00:00:51.780> you're<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the humidity where you're at in the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
the humidity where you're at in the
temperature<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.489> anywhere<00:00:53.879> from<00:00:54.059> fifteen<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
temperature but anywhere from fifteen to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.410 
temperature but anywhere from fifteen to
thirty<00:00:54.809> minutes<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> set<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.250> mix<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
thirty minutes to set up just mix the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.799 
thirty minutes to set up just mix the
investment<00:00:58.140> pour<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> cavities<00:01:01.070> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
investment pour it into the cavities and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
investment pour it into the cavities and
pop<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> pellets<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> few

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
pop out the pellets in just a few

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.940 
pop out the pellets in just a few
minutes<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.909> set<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.260> ready<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> D

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
minutes so here it is set up ready to D

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:20.300 
minutes so here it is set up ready to D
mold<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.990> press<00:01:18.290> behind<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.799> pellet

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
mold and I just press behind the pellet

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.790 
mold and I just press behind the pellet
and<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.330> pop<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.750> out

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.290 

so<00:01:28.800> here<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.250> finished<00:01:29.760> now<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.940> beauty

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
so here they are finished now the beauty

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.720 
so here they are finished now the beauty
of<00:01:30.330> these<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> size<00:01:31.980> is<00:01:32.010> marked

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
of these is that the size is marked

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.240 
of these is that the size is marked
right<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.810> pellet<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:34.800> never<00:01:34.980> any

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
right on the pellet so there's never any

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
right on the pellet so there's never any
guessing<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.730> what<00:01:35.880> size<00:01:36.300> you<00:01:36.510> have<00:01:36.890> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
guessing about what size you have the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
guessing about what size you have the
six<00:01:38.850> has<00:01:39.090> got<00:01:39.330> an<00:01:39.450> underline<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> know

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
six has got an underline so you know

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
six has got an underline so you know
that<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.010> six<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.610> nine<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.260> use

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that it's a six and not a nine so to use

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.250 
that it's a six and not a nine so to use
the<00:01:46.740> pellets<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.340> place<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.180> pellet<00:01:48.630> inside<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
the pellets you place a pellet inside of

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.240 
the pellets you place a pellet inside of
the<00:01:49.350> ring<00:01:49.530> before<00:01:50.250> firing<00:01:50.940> after<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.900> fires

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the ring before firing after it fires

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.820 
the ring before firing after it fires
dissolve<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> pellet<00:01:53.760> away<00:01:53.940> in<00:01:54.090> water<00:01:54.330> and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
dissolve the pellet away in water and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030 
dissolve the pellet away in water and
then<00:01:55.830> discard<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.740> you're<00:01:58.860> finished

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
then discard and when you're finished

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.810 
then discard and when you're finished
you've<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.580> perfectly<00:02:00.119> sized<00:02:00.450> rings
