00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
we got from Activision and then look at

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.779 
we got from Activision and then look at
his<00:00:17.400> powers<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.779> named<00:00:18.960> him<00:00:19.170> cranium

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
his powers I and I named him cranium

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.279 
his powers I and I named him cranium
usually<00:00:20.789> his<00:00:20.910> name<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> blaster<00:00:21.689> mine<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
usually his name is blaster mine but I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.420 
usually his name is blaster mine but I
think<00:00:22.619> cranium<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.279> better<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:25.430> here's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
think cranium was better so here's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.689 
think cranium was better so here's
normal<00:00:27.029> tacky<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.619> melee<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
normal tacky like it's not a melee and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
normal tacky like it's not a melee and
it's<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> range<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.750> kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it's not a range it's kind of just a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.880 
it's not a range it's kind of just a
wave<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.399> energy<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.969> brain<00:00:33.540> waves<00:00:33.890> his

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
wave of energy will brain waves his

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
wave of energy will brain waves his
other<00:00:35.219> move<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.480> levitate<00:00:36.899> enemies<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.620> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
other move is to levitate enemies and it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.470 
other move is to levitate enemies and it
just<00:00:37.950> smashes<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> ground<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
just smashes them to the ground and I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you want them to and then mine smashes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.749 
you want them to and then mine smashes
that<00:01:44.939> while<00:01:45.240> pressing<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.930> X<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.649> Y<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.579> can

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
that while pressing a X or Y you can
slam<00:01:48.030> them<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.509> repeatedly<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> can

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
slam them down repeatedly so you can

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.080 
slam them down repeatedly so you can
basically<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.600> keep<00:01:52.640> like<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
basically just like just keep like just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
basically just like just keep like just
keep<00:01:54.240> damaging<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.409> help<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.740> doing

keep damaging them what help them doing

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
keep damaging them what help them doing
anything<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:57.180> his<00:01:57.360> soul<00:01:57.600> gem<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.170> probably

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
anything then his soul gem is probably

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.539 
anything then his soul gem is probably
really<00:01:59.610> really<00:02:00.329> useful<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.250> hold

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
really really useful is that if you hold
