a<00:03:35.320> little<00:03:35.590> more<00:03:37.050> more<00:03:38.050> emotional<00:03:38.680> than<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
a little more more emotional than the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.940 
a little more more emotional than the
Aussie<00:03:40.420> version<00:03:40.990> but<00:03:41.170> if<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.500> haven't<00:03:41.710> heard
