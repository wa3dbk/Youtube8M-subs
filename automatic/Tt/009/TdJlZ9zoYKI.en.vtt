to get through each week and some weeks

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
to get through each week and some weeks
obviously<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.720> were<00:01:42.869> medicine<00:01:43.440> which

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
obviously when you were medicine which

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
obviously when you were medicine which
not<00:01:43.800> so<00:01:43.950> good<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:45.180> did<00:01:45.330> enjoy<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
not so good but we really did enjoy it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
not so good but we really did enjoy it
and<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.140> didn't<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.619> enjoyment<00:01:47.069> to<00:01:47.550> go

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and we didn't want that enjoyment to go

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.419 
and we didn't want that enjoyment to go
so<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:48.780> why<00:01:48.959> we<00:01:49.080> never<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.800> thought<00:01:50.100> or

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
so that's why we never really thought or

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.980 
so that's why we never really thought or
