 Goal here about this episode written in 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.590
 independent internet sources about 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.659
 40 seconds before the end of the match the score was 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.870
 equal to 1 1 at this moment one of 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.700
 Ecuadorians are perfect 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.710
 openly with all the fluff punched in the legs 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.130
 swiss who owned a sword in the middle 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.200
 fields 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.420
 the judge should have been assigned a penalty and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 give aqua firebox at least yellow 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.970
 card 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.950
 downed swiss died immediately get up on 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.900
 legs holding the ball and the referee was only 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.850
 fraction of a second to make a decision and 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.950
 Ravshan Irmatov with this moment 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.180
 correctly your situation and allowed 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.220
 special develop attack 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.040
 instead of assigning in 40 seconds 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.840
 until the end of the game penalty center through 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.860
 a few seconds the swiss scored 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.860
 beautiful winning goal 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.830
 despite the fact that at the beginning of the match 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.110
 Swiss team first missed 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.450
 gold final of the match we were lucky and 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.740
 our team managed to win we 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.780
 We know that this happened thanks to 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.490
 first judging rashan yrmatov 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.650
 he is a very experienced wolfworm and is 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.960
 FIFA arbitrator learn years 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.640
 Irmatov very confidently spent this match 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.130
 I think in Uzbekistan everyone can 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.480
 proud of their countrymen and what 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.700
 As for Switzerland, we are in our own way 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.740
 thankful for professional refereeing 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.570
 psychologically point of view we were 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.280
 It is very important to win the first match 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.440
 since we have to meet next 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.420
 with the French team, I believe that ravshan 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.230
 Irmatov should continue to judge the match 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.850
 World Cup in Brazil 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.070
 After the match, you discuss many stars 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.500
 football attending matches Alan 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.720
 wide dry rio ferdinand simple 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.580
 admired by the judge and his instant 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.320
 reaction and here are some more opinions 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.970
 people having a direct 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.000
 professional attitude to football 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.280
 what is a good judge of this first 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.900
 queue choosing the right position you 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.510
 notice here we are watching this championship 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.080
 even from the floor last game of switzerland 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.560
 Ecuador and rashan all the time turned out to be 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.769
 center in the thick of things that is it in 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.360
 right choice of position then him 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.940
 functionality not every 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.830
 judge so move 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.870
 Look at him I also saw him 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.629
 motion 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.900
 much to exceed the motion of other judges then 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.879
 there he is where necessary in 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.310
 correct position and take 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.980
 the right decision is joy 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.250
 the fact that the son of the Uzbek people is rashan 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.250
 Irmatov one low positive 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.730
 well of course we are proud that we have needs 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.530
 camp down such a pair 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.140
 who are the performances of his world championships 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.489
 Asian Championships I compare 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.750
 like with olympic champions i'm sure 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.019
 what will he judge 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.650
 one of the main matches in the championship 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.650
 peace in principle with his in his duties 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.229
 what you included was practically 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.690
 no mistakes very good continuation 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.120
 gave when there was a violation against 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.990
 Swiss player did not he gave 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.520
 continuation of it is so winning goal then 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.190
 so I think it's right 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.160
 match at a very high level this year 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.530
 I think that the onions will probably be 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.330
 with dignity 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.870
 judging the final it's my 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.870
 assumption
