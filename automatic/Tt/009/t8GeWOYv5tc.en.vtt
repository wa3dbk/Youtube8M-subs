process of can be a year or longer to
put<00:01:14.520> together<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.939> funding<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.259> a

book<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.689> thought

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
book like that and so we we thought

book like that and so we we thought
there's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> potential<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
there's a lot of potential to use the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.510 
there's a lot of potential to use the
book<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> Richard's<00:01:22.110> work<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:23.340> bring

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
book and Richard's work to bring

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.539

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.530 
attention to issues in in the Congo and
and<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.799> agreed<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.829> Co<00:01:29.670> publish<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.390> with

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
hello so I'm very interested in in my

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.620 
hello so I'm very interested in in my
work<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.830> stories<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.700> try<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:51.970> tell<00:01:52.270> are

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
work the stories that I try to tell are

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.270 
work the stories that I try to tell are
often<00:01:53.049> very<00:01:53.229> intangible<00:01:53.740> they're<00:01:54.130> very

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
often very intangible they're very

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.530 
often very intangible they're very
difficult<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:55.180> tell<00:01:55.450> even<00:01:56.159> even<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.520> see<00:01:57.729> it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
difficult to tell even even to see it's

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.990 
difficult to tell even even to see it's
very<00:01:58.600> difficult<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.170> put<00:01:59.350> certain<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.820> very

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
very difficult to put certain very very

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.270 
very difficult to put certain very very
complex<00:02:01.450> situations<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.770> front<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.100> lens

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
complex situations in front of a lens

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.039 
complex situations in front of a lens
and<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.240> was<00:02:04.360> very<00:02:04.420> interested<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
and so I was very interested in the

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.469 
and so I was very interested in the
point<00:02:05.289> at<00:02:05.470> which<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:07.210> just<00:02:07.240> photography

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
point at which not just photography

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.530 
point at which not just photography
fails<00:02:08.170> us<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:08.590> also<00:02:09.060> sight<00:02:10.060> itself<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.590> so

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
fails us but also sight itself and so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.970 
fails us but also sight itself and so
thinking<00:02:13.540> through<00:02:13.720> those<00:02:13.900> themes<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.590> became

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
thinking through those themes I became

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.630 
thinking through those themes I became
very<00:02:15.220> interested<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:18.150> certain<00:02:19.150> type<00:02:19.330> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
very interested in a certain type of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.979 
very interested in a certain type of
military<00:02:21.640> surveillance<00:02:22.060> technology<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
military surveillance technology that

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.479 
military surveillance technology that
that<00:02:23.019> had<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.830> recently<00:02:24.190> become

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
that had just recently become

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.360 
that had just recently become
discontinued<00:02:25.209> by<00:02:25.600> Kodak<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.980> film<00:02:27.220> they

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
discontinued by Kodak it's a film they

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.400 
discontinued by Kodak it's a film they
have<00:02:27.550> called<00:02:27.850> era<00:02:28.209> chrome<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.319> was

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
have called era chrome and it was

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.880 
have called era chrome and it was
developed<00:02:29.739> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> start<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.580> 1940s<00:02:31.799> as<00:02:32.799> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
developed in the start of the 1940s as a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.370 
developed in the start of the 1940s as a
sort<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.400> camouflage<00:02:34.030> detection<00:02:34.870> technology

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
sort of camouflage detection technology

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.800 
sort of camouflage detection technology
so<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.910> sort<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.299> green

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
so here you can see the sort of green

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.370 
so here you can see the sort of green
cyan<00:02:38.140> parts<00:02:38.769> are<00:02:39.010> where<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.489> plants<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.380> dead

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
cyan parts are where the plants are dead

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.190 
cyan parts are where the plants are dead
so<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> track<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.360> see<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.660> right

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
so the track there you can see we right

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.509 
so the track there you can see we right
in<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.350> middle<00:02:44.500> there's<00:02:44.739> like<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> little<00:02:45.220> path

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
in the middle there's like a little path

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.470 
in the middle there's like a little path
and<00:02:46.299> that's<00:02:46.510> that's<00:02:46.900> dead<00:02:47.340> foliage<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:49.180> has<00:02:49.329> no

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and that's that's dead foliage it has no

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
and that's that's dead foliage it has no
chlorophyll<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.769> where<00:02:50.950> there's<00:02:51.160> chlorophyll

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
chlorophyll so where there's chlorophyll

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.580 
chlorophyll so where there's chlorophyll
in<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.000> happy<00:02:52.480> healthy<00:02:52.660> plants<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.440> goes

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
in the happy healthy plants that goes

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.000 
in the happy healthy plants that goes
pink<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.070> red<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:56.019> we're<00:02:56.500> dealing<00:02:56.709> we're

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
pink or red so we're dealing we're

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.440 
pink or red so we're dealing we're
looking<00:02:57.280> into<00:02:57.400> an<00:02:57.549> invisible<00:02:57.850> spectrum<00:02:58.390> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
looking into an invisible spectrum of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.910 
looking into an invisible spectrum of
light<00:02:58.630> here<00:02:58.900> which<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.200> infrared<00:02:59.590> light<00:02:59.739> which

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
light here which is infrared light which

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.890 
light here which is infrared light which
is<00:03:00.040> invisible<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.640> human<00:03:00.700> eye<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> it's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
is invisible to the human eye and it's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.150 
is invisible to the human eye and it's
registering<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.560> light<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:02.890> its<00:03:03.010> own

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
registering that light and its own

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.750 
registering that light and its own
peculiar<00:03:03.970> way<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.799> was<00:03:06.040> fascinated<00:03:06.430> by

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
peculiar way and I was fascinated by

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.590 
peculiar way and I was fascinated by
that<00:03:07.410> by<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.470> sort<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.359> peering<00:03:10.359> into<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
that by this sort of peering into the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.530 
that by this sort of peering into the
hidden<00:03:11.280> because<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.579> congos<00:03:12.940> conflict<00:03:13.420> is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
hidden because the congos conflict is

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.229 
hidden because the congos conflict is
very<00:03:13.870> hidden<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.380> several<00:03:15.100> levels<00:03:15.250> not<00:03:15.940> least

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
very hidden on several levels not least

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.449 
very hidden on several levels not least
of<00:03:16.450> which<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.870> mass<00:03:17.049> media<00:03:17.230> level<00:03:17.500> it's

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
of which is the mass media level it's

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.340 
of which is the mass media level it's
not<00:03:18.640> people<00:03:19.000> aren't<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.299> much<00:03:19.870> interested

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
not people aren't that much interested

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.440 
not people aren't that much interested
in<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.500> anymore<00:03:20.680> because<00:03:20.980> we're<00:03:21.760> saturated

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
in it anymore because we're saturated

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.930 
in it anymore because we're saturated
it's<00:03:22.750> too<00:03:22.959> complex<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.620> story<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:24.010> tell<00:03:24.040> it's

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it's too complex a story to tell it's

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.940 
it's too complex a story to tell it's
been<00:03:25.120> going<00:03:25.329> on<00:03:25.420> for<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.780> many<00:03:25.930> years<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.769> will

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
been going on for so many years it will

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.530 
been going on for so many years it will
never<00:03:27.100> end

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
never end

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.979 
never end
within<00:03:28.540> our<00:03:28.630> look<00:03:28.780> for<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.140> while<00:03:29.290> sadly<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.900> if

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
within our look for a while sadly so if

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.569 
within our look for a while sadly so if
you<00:03:32.109> take<00:03:32.320> for<00:03:32.560> example<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.890> conflict<00:03:33.459> like

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
you take for example a conflict like

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.120 
you take for example a conflict like
Darfur<00:03:33.820> it's<00:03:34.810> very<00:03:35.200> sexy<00:03:35.530> story<00:03:35.950> in

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
Darfur it's very sexy story in

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.849 
Darfur it's very sexy story in
comparison<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.060> about<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.690> know<00:03:37.859> it's

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
comparison it's about you know it's

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.949 
comparison it's about you know it's
about<00:03:38.950> genocide<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:39.910> about<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.720> know<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
about genocide it's about you know the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.170 
about genocide it's about you know the
it's<00:03:41.500> it's<00:03:42.190> very<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.670> know<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.030> say<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
it's it's very you know you can say the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.870 
it's it's very you know you can say the
Northern<00:03:43.930> Arabs<00:03:44.260> versus<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.670> southern

Northern Arabs versus the the southern

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.729 
Northern Arabs versus the the southern
black<00:03:46.150> animists<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.140> know<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.470> it's<00:03:47.680> very

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
black animists you know it's it's very

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.500 
black animists you know it's it's very
simple<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.180> got<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.329> lot<00:03:49.479> more

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
simple and so it's got a lot more

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.920 
simple and so it's got a lot more
coverage<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.260> spite<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.709> fact<00:03:50.889> that<00:03:50.979> a<00:03:51.250> lot

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
coverage in spite of the fact that a lot

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.860 
coverage in spite of the fact that a lot
your<00:03:52.019> people<00:03:52.500> have<00:03:52.709> died<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.359> Congo<00:03:54.719> we

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
your people have died and in Congo we

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.360 
your people have died and in Congo we
have<00:03:55.049> different<00:03:55.590> rebel<00:03:55.709> groups<00:03:55.890> of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
have different rebel groups of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.470 
have different rebel groups of
constantly<00:03:56.879> switching<00:03:57.209> allegiance<00:03:57.750> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
constantly switching allegiance and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.300 
constantly switching allegiance and
there<00:04:00.480> many<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.019> them<00:04:01.170> are<00:04:01.260> nomadic<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:02.159> they

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
there many of them are nomadic so they

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.830 
there many of them are nomadic so they
don't<00:04:02.459> have<00:04:02.730> infrastructure<00:04:03.569> they<00:04:03.659> don't

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
don't have infrastructure they don't

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.479 
don't have infrastructure they don't
have<00:04:04.019> architecture<00:04:04.650> they<00:04:04.739> don't<00:04:04.890> have<00:04:05.010> basis

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
have architecture they don't have basis

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.979 
have architecture they don't have basis
they<00:04:05.609> don't<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:05.849> Garrison's<00:04:06.359> they<00:04:06.599> they

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
they don't have Garrison's they they

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.140 
they don't have Garrison's they they
shift<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.680> they<00:04:07.799> work<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.069> small<00:04:08.549> units<00:04:08.579> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
shift and they work in small units and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.979 
shift and they work in small units and
it<00:04:09.269> sort<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.739> work<00:04:10.739> through<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.340> jungle<00:04:11.760> so

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
it sort of work through the jungle so

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.179 
it sort of work through the jungle so
they're<00:04:12.989> very<00:04:13.139> hard<00:04:13.379> to<00:04:13.469> detect<00:04:13.739> and<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.159> I

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
they're very hard to detect and so I

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.990 
they're very hard to detect and so I
found<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.879> idea<00:04:15.269> of<00:04:15.889> infrared<00:04:16.889> film<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.400> kind

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
found this idea of infrared film a kind

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.900 
found this idea of infrared film a kind
