this week's how-to has to do with the
installation<00:00:04.609> of<00:00:04.700> carpeting<00:00:05.240> it's<00:00:05.899> more

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:06.349 
installation of carpeting it's more

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:07.660 
installation of carpeting it's more
difficult<00:00:06.620> than<00:00:07.010> you<00:00:07.189> think

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
difficult than you think

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.860 
difficult than you think
I<00:00:07.700> mean<00:00:07.939> you'd<00:00:08.059> think<00:00:08.090> you'd<00:00:08.389> be<00:00:08.480> able<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:08.660> just

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
I mean you'd think you'd be able to just

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.390 
I mean you'd think you'd be able to just
take<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.170> carpeting<00:00:09.620> out<00:00:09.680> of<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:09.860> box<00:00:10.070> lay<00:00:10.340> it

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
take the carpeting out of the box lay it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.340 
take the carpeting out of the box lay it
in<00:00:10.610> there<00:00:10.760> and<00:00:10.820> you're<00:00:10.940> done<00:00:11.180> but<00:00:11.720> watch<00:00:12.020> this

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
in there and you're done but watch this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.710 
in there and you're done but watch this
sequence<00:00:12.590> of<00:00:13.040> how-to<00:00:13.519> videos<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:14.360> install

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
sequence of how-to videos to install

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.420 
sequence of how-to videos to install
carpeting<00:00:15.290> and<00:00:15.410> I<00:00:15.710> think<00:00:15.980> you<00:00:16.070> got<00:00:16.189> to<00:00:16.279> learn<00:00:16.369> a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
carpeting and I think you got to learn a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.670 
carpeting and I think you got to learn a
lot<00:00:16.670> from<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:17.090> thing<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:17.930> want<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.230> do<00:00:18.410> first

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
lot from it thing you want to do first

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.890 
lot from it thing you want to do first
is<00:00:18.920> take<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.430> carpet<00:00:19.820> out<00:00:20.030> of<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.240> box<00:00:20.480> and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
is take the carpet out of the box and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.680 
is take the carpet out of the box and
spread<00:00:21.770> it<00:00:21.890> out<00:00:22.010> because<00:00:22.940> it's<00:00:23.270> in<00:00:23.420> such<00:00:23.660> a

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
spread it out because it's in such a

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.019 
spread it out because it's in such a
small<00:00:23.900> box<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:24.680> way<00:00:24.830> it's<00:00:25.010> rolled<00:00:25.279> up<00:00:25.490> it

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
small box and the way it's rolled up it

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.840 
small box and the way it's rolled up it
has<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.270> lot<00:00:26.570> of<00:00:26.600> creases<00:00:27.109> in<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:27.850> wrinkles

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
has a lot of creases in it and wrinkles

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.939 
has a lot of creases in it and wrinkles
in<00:00:29.029> it<00:00:29.119> if<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.720> say<00:00:29.900> that<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.289> Sun<00:00:30.560> a<00:00:30.590> lot<00:00:30.830> of

then slowly work the carpeting down to
the<00:01:09.620> point<00:01:09.860> where<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:10.910> kind<00:01:11.150> of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the point where you can just kind of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.450 
the point where you can just kind of
wiggle<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.870> around<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.680> shifter<00:01:13.070> opening

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
wiggle it around the shifter opening

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.560 
wiggle it around the shifter opening
they<00:01:13.610> don't<00:01:13.790> give<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.120> whole<00:01:14.270> lot<00:01:14.420> of

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
they don't give you a whole lot of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.120 
they don't give you a whole lot of
margin<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:14.960> error<00:01:15.320> when<00:01:15.590> you're<00:01:15.710> doing<00:01:15.980> these

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
margin for error when you're doing these

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.640 
margin for error when you're doing these
shifter<00:01:16.610> openings<00:01:16.970> lithics<00:01:17.330> carpeting<00:01:17.870> so<00:01:18.470> go

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
shifter openings lithics carpeting so go

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.380 
shifter openings lithics carpeting so go
a<00:01:18.680> little<00:01:19.010> bit<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.460> time<00:01:19.760> because<00:01:20.090> once<00:01:20.300> you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
a little bit that time because once you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.600 
a little bit that time because once you
cut<00:01:20.570> too<00:01:20.750> much<00:01:20.780> off<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.230> there<00:01:21.530> you're<00:01:22.190> showing

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
cut too much off of there you're showing

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.250 
cut too much off of there you're showing
the<00:01:22.730> floor<00:01:22.970> pan

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
the floor pan

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.200 
the floor pan
underneath<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.370> little<00:01:25.550> bit<00:01:25.730> that<00:01:25.940> time

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
underneath it so a little bit that time

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.960 
underneath it so a little bit that time
is<00:01:26.420> better<00:01:26.800> okay<00:01:27.800> I<00:01:27.830> basically<00:01:28.310> whittled<00:01:28.790> out

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
is better okay I basically whittled out

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.970 
is better okay I basically whittled out
and<00:01:29.300> over<00:01:29.510> that<00:01:29.720> opening<00:01:30.170> for<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.500> shifter

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
and over that opening for this shifter

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.640 
and over that opening for this shifter
just<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.910> little<00:01:32.210> bit<00:01:32.330> out<00:01:32.510> of<00:01:32.540> time<00:01:32.870> where<00:01:33.620> I

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
just a little bit out of time where I

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.290 
just a little bit out of time where I
can<00:01:33.740> now<00:01:33.980> tuck<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.450> way<00:01:35.510> around

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
can now tuck it in all the way around

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.940 
can now tuck it in all the way around
that's<00:01:38.300> exactly<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.140> way<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:39.290> want<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.710> just

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
that's exactly the way you want it just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.120 
that's exactly the way you want it just
like<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.430> because<00:01:41.120> there's<00:01:41.330> another<00:01:41.600> piece

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
like that because there's another piece

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.470 
like that because there's another piece
this<00:01:43.130> piece<00:01:43.430> here<00:01:43.730> that's<00:01:43.910> actually<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
this piece here that's actually the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.470 
this piece here that's actually the
shifter<00:01:44.840> bezel<00:01:44.990> adapter<00:01:45.790> that<00:01:46.790> will<00:01:47.030> lay<00:01:47.270> on

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
shifter bezel adapter that will lay on

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.550 
shifter bezel adapter that will lay on
here<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.300> doesn't<00:01:50.660> cover<00:01:50.780> much<00:01:51.080> more<00:01:51.350> so

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
here and it doesn't cover much more so
