00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
actually quite simple I divide the 3

like<00:02:57.350> this<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:01.430> another<00:03:01.670> thing<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.209> I've

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
like this that's another thing that I've

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.840 
like this that's another thing that I've
seen<00:03:02.630> people<00:03:03.230> use<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.800> fulcrum<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.610> doing

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
seen people use the fulcrum just doing

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.240 
seen people use the fulcrum just doing
this<00:03:06.459> okay

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
this okay

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.900 
this okay
so<00:03:10.250> when<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.120> instance<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.730> can

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
so when you do this for instance you can

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.460 
so when you do this for instance you can
actually<00:03:14.120> control<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.840> bounce<00:03:14.990> if<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
actually control the bounce if you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.949 
actually control the bounce if you
practice<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.370> for<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> while<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.780> can

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
practice that for a while you can

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.690 
practice that for a while you can
actually<00:03:18.080> control<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.740> bounce<00:03:18.890> I'm<00:03:19.190> not<00:03:19.490> an

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
actually control the bounce I'm not an

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.790 
actually control the bounce I'm not an
expert<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:21.260> probably<00:03:21.590> didn't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
expert in this so it's probably didn't

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.259 
expert in this so it's probably didn't
sound<00:03:22.100> very<00:03:22.220> good<00:03:22.430> when<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.850> do<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:25.269> however

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
sound very good when I do it but however

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.810 
sound very good when I do it but however
you<00:03:26.570> control<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.860> first<00:03:28.190> stroke<00:03:28.519> will

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
you control it the first stroke will

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.110 
you control it the first stroke will
always<00:03:29.330> be<00:03:29.600> accented<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:34.550> rest<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
always be accented and the rest of the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.080 
always be accented and the rest of the
strokes<00:03:35.420> even<00:03:35.840> if<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.410> extend<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.850> more

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
strokes even if you extend it for more

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.960 
strokes even if you extend it for more
than<00:03:38.120> three<00:03:41.470> will<00:03:42.470> always<00:03:42.860> be<00:03:43.040> weaker<00:03:43.580> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
than three will always be weaker and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.270 
than three will always be weaker and
weaker<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:44.959> along

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
weaker as you go along

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.890 
weaker as you go along
okay<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.489> with<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.030> other<00:03:47.239> technique<00:03:47.690> with

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
okay and with the other technique with

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.590 
okay and with the other technique with
the<00:03:48.019> my<00:03:48.290> technique<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:50.060> don't<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.450> don't

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
the my technique and you don't you don't

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.259 
the my technique and you don't you don't
get<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.920> because<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:53.150> do<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:54.519> okay

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:07.290 

so<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.540> act<00:03:59.780> even<00:04:00.019> accent<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.709> last<00:04:00.950> one

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.710 

okay<00:04:08.300> so<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.989> get<00:04:09.110> a<00:04:09.170> very<00:04:09.500> even<00:04:10.720> sounding

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
okay so you get a very even sounding

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.070 
okay so you get a very even sounding
first<00:04:12.560> swing<00:04:15.880> as<00:04:16.880> well<00:04:17.120> I'm<00:04:17.330> left-handed<00:04:17.690> by

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
first swing as well I'm left-handed by

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.650 
first swing as well I'm left-handed by
the<00:04:18.140> way<00:04:21.970> okay<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:25.130> accent<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.850> big

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the way okay so the accent is a big

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.370 
the way okay so the accent is a big
issue<00:04:27.140> for<00:04:27.350> me<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.890> that's<00:04:28.220> why<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:29.380> develop

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
issue for me so that's why I develop

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.610 
issue for me so that's why I develop
this<00:04:30.530> technique<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:32.780> other<00:04:32.930> issue<00:04:33.169> is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
this technique and the other issue is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.000 
this technique and the other issue is
also

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
also

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.720 
also
I<00:04:35.040> don't<00:04:35.880> always<00:04:36.120> want<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.930> limited<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
I don't always want to be limited in to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.150 
I don't always want to be limited in to
playing<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.960> three<00:04:40.230> notes<00:04:40.440> sometimes<00:04:41.010> I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
playing just three notes sometimes I

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.370 
playing just three notes sometimes I
want<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.430> play<00:04:41.640> for<00:04:42.020> sometimes<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.140> want<00:04:43.320> to

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
want to play for sometimes I want to

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.700 
want to play for sometimes I want to
play<00:04:43.620> five<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.430> there's<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.090> great<00:04:45.330> way<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.930> my

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
play five and there's a great way in my

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.400 
play five and there's a great way in my
technique<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.460> do<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.640> five<00:04:48.150> actually<00:04:49.050> which<00:04:49.290> is

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
technique to do a five actually which is

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.680 
technique to do a five actually which is
again<00:04:49.740> really<00:04:50.460> simple<00:04:50.880> when<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.210> when<00:04:51.570> you

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
again really simple when you when you

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.960 
again really simple when you when you
slow<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.380> down<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:53.040> they<00:04:53.520> just<00:04:53.760> have<00:04:53.940> one

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
slow it down is they just have one

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
slow it down is they just have one
stroke<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.080> then<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.320> push<00:04:55.620> pull<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.130> just

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
stroke and then a push pull and just

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.440 
stroke and then a push pull and just
another<00:04:56.910> push<00:04:57.180> pull<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.700> gives<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.090> five

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
another push pull so it gives you five

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.990 
another push pull so it gives you five
so<00:05:00.990> one<00:05:01.290> one<00:05:02.070> two<00:05:02.430> one<00:05:02.670> two<00:05:02.910> one<00:05:03.530> one<00:05:04.640> two<00:05:05.640> one

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
so one one two one two one one two one

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.280 
so one one two one two one one two one
two<00:05:06.180> one<00:05:06.750> two<00:05:07.530> three<00:05:08.010> four<00:05:08.430> five<00:05:10.310> yeah<00:05:12.290> and

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
two one two three four five yeah and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.220 
two one two three four five yeah and
again<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.460> can<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.910> can<00:05:18.090> accent<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.690> last<00:05:18.900> if<00:05:19.110> I

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
again I can you can accent the last if I

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:30.500 
again I can you can accent the last if I
want<00:05:20.600> if<00:05:21.600> I<00:05:21.810> want<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> first<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.390> can

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
want if I want the first so as you can

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.600 
want if I want the first so as you can
see<00:05:30.780> it<00:05:31.560> sounds<00:05:31.740> quite<00:05:32.010> even

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
see it sounds quite even

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.650 
see it sounds quite even
of<00:05:33.540> course<00:05:33.840> this<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.500> does<00:05:35.010> require<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:36.570> bit

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
of course this this does require a bit

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.360 
of course this this does require a bit
of<00:05:36.900> practice<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.790> and<00:05:39.530> in<00:05:40.530> actual<00:05:40.980> fact<00:05:41.190> you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
of practice and and in actual fact you

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
of practice and and in actual fact you
can<00:05:41.610> do<00:05:41.760> more<00:05:41.970> more<00:05:42.660> strokes<00:05:43.730> you<00:05:44.730> can<00:05:44.760> add<00:05:45.090> a

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
can do more more strokes you can add a

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:53.210 
can do more more strokes you can add a
push<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:45.870> pull<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:46.740> even<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:52.010> and<00:05:53.010> in

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
push and pull to that even so and in

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.300 
push and pull to that even so and in
actual<00:05:53.550> fact<00:05:53.580> you<00:05:54.150> can<00:05:55.070> infinitely<00:05:56.070> add

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
actual fact you can infinitely add

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.880 
actual fact you can infinitely add
pushing<00:05:56.820> pools<00:05:59.060> and<00:06:00.060> get<00:06:00.690> this<00:06:00.870> which<00:06:01.710> is

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
pushing pools and get this which is

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.510 
pushing pools and get this which is
basically<00:06:02.340> I<00:06:02.810> would<00:06:03.810> say<00:06:03.900> more<00:06:04.200> like<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.520> 100

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
basically I would say more like a 100

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:16.280 
basically I would say more like a 100
roll<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:12.180> you<00:06:12.810> can<00:06:12.990> see<00:06:13.200> Jojo<00:06:14.010> Mayer<00:06:15.290> playing

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
roll and you can see Jojo Mayer playing

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.190 
roll and you can see Jojo Mayer playing
