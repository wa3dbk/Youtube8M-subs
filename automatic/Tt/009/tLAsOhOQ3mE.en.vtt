00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
main ideas that make it so unique and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.620 
main ideas that make it so unique and
that<00:02:18.760> made<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.420> fresh<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.760> bringing<00:02:21.760> also<00:02:22.300> it

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that made so fresh and bringing also it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.840

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
now the the black is version I would say

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390 
now the the black is version I would say
is<00:02:28.270> four<00:02:28.630> against<00:02:28.870> four<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.440> give<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.950> bunch

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
passive armor part and active ability

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.680 
passive armor part and active ability
like<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.740> super<00:02:36.310> ability<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.450> use

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
like a super ability that you can use

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.440 
like a super ability that you can use
you<00:02:38.020> have<00:02:38.140> some<00:02:38.320> kind<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.560> specialization

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
you have some kind of specialization

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.540 
you have some kind of specialization
inside<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.110> gameplay<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.100> not<00:02:42.250> like

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
inside the the gameplay so it's not like

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.460 
inside the the gameplay so it's not like
everyone<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> team's<00:02:43.900> doing<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.260> same

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
everyone is in the team's doing the same

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830 
everyone is in the team's doing the same
thing<00:02:44.770> we<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.250> get<00:02:45.459> people<00:02:46.090> who<00:02:46.300> are<00:02:46.450> kind<00:02:46.720> of

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
thing we can get people who are kind of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.310 
thing we can get people who are kind of
more<00:02:47.080> support<00:02:47.709> those<00:02:48.340> who<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.790> actually<00:02:49.320> go

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
more support those who can actually go

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.230 
more support those who can actually go
faster<00:02:50.680> into<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.070> frontline<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.790> attack<00:02:52.060> the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
faster into the frontline and attack the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.970 
faster into the frontline and attack the
other<00:02:52.390> team<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.020> start<00:02:53.320> off<00:02:53.470> as<00:02:53.709> playing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
other team that you start off as playing

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.260 
other team that you start off as playing
the<00:02:54.160> spy<00:02:54.430> you're<00:02:55.300> sort<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:56.160> stealthy

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
the spy you're sort of a stealthy

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.290 
the spy you're sort of a stealthy
meticulous<00:02:58.270> very<00:02:58.870> agile<00:02:59.850> active<00:03:00.850> character

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
meticulous very agile active character

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.759 
meticulous very agile active character
uses<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.810> environment<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.380> their<00:03:02.500> advantage

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
uses the environment to their advantage

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.100 
uses the environment to their advantage
so<00:03:03.459> basically<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.000> play<00:03:04.180> one<00:03:04.360> round<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> spy

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
so basically you play one round as a spy

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.009 
so basically you play one round as a spy
and<00:03:05.350> one<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.890> Rama's<00:03:06.190> emerge<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:07.420> bit<00:03:07.870> like

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
and one of the Rama's emerge a bit like

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.259 
and one of the Rama's emerge a bit like
an<00:03:08.170> American<00:03:08.440> football<00:03:08.620> play<00:03:09.130> offense<00:03:09.519> the

an American football play offense the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.180 
an American football play offense the

defense then when you switch you come

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.060 
defense then when you switch you come
