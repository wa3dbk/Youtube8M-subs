00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
monitor capture within OBS this could be

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.290 
monitor capture within OBS this could be
a<00:00:27.119> webcam<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.960> capture<00:00:28.500> card<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.949> TV<00:00:29.279> tuner<00:00:29.460> etc

so<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> set<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:31.800> actually<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.160> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so to set one up we're actually going to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.310 
so to set one up we're actually going to
use<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> global<00:00:32.940> source<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.230> know

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
use a global source so if you don't know

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.750 
use a global source so if you don't know
what<00:00:34.469> global<00:00:34.800> sources<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.640> would

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
what global sources are and you would

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
what global sources are and you would
like<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.360> check<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.079> my<00:00:37.230> video<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.530> them

you there's no live preview with it so
it<00:03:50.100> will<00:03:50.280> take<00:03:50.490> some<00:03:50.730> testing<00:03:51.360> and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
it will take some testing and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.190 
configuring to get it to work but it
actually<00:03:53.280> works<00:03:53.640> pretty<00:03:53.910> well<00:03:54.060> where<00:03:54.870> capture
