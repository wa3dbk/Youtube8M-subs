the brows to look too solid and opaque
you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.430> sometimes<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.630> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you know I think sometimes you can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
you know I think sometimes you can
overdo<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> there's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
overdo it and not see that there's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
overdo it and not see that there's
actually<00:01:47.790> hair<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.439> my

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

brows filled in with this now and I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090

think<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> still<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.740> some<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
think you can still see you know some of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.399 
think you can still see you know some of
my<00:01:53.250> hairs<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:55.049> hard

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409

things<00:02:06.369> out<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> little<00:02:06.970> bit<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.479> was<00:02:07.600> just

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
things out a little bit it was just

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.770 
things out a little bit it was just
really<00:02:08.170> easy<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.890> go<00:02:09.130> too<00:02:09.759> far<00:02:10.030> with<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.539> I'm

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
really easy to go too far with this I'm

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.020 
really easy to go too far with this I'm
not<00:02:10.840> saying<00:02:11.319> I'm<00:02:11.560> unhappy<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.640> finished

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
not saying I'm unhappy with the finished

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.550 
not saying I'm unhappy with the finished
result<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.989> little<00:02:14.349> bit<00:02:14.590> darker<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.550> more

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560

opaque I guess more filled in than what
I<00:02:19.959> might<00:02:20.170> usually<00:02:20.410> do<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.819> don't<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.239> it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
I might usually do but I don't think it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
I might usually do but I don't think it
looks<00:02:22.450> bad<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.110> felt<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.770> took<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.069> lot<00:02:24.220> of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
looks bad I felt like it took a lot of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.490 
looks bad I felt like it took a lot of
time<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:25.090> get<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.569> place<00:02:25.930> maybe<00:02:26.290> you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
time to get to this place maybe you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.470 
time to get to this place maybe you
don't<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.739> very<00:02:26.890> thick<00:02:27.489> brows<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.150> begin

little drier consistency when you put a
brush<00:03:19.690> into<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.590> doesn't<00:03:21.450> pick<00:03:22.450> up<00:03:22.630> too

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
brush into this it doesn't pick up too

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.900 
brush into this it doesn't pick up too
much<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:23.410> know<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.400> actually<00:03:24.549> has<00:03:24.880> some

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
much you know and it actually has some

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330 
much you know and it actually has some
hold<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.900> find<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.560> easier<00:03:27.040> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
hold to it I find this to be easier to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.660 
hold to it I find this to be easier to
use<00:03:27.670> quicker<00:03:28.660> process<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:29.769> me<00:03:29.920> plus<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:30.549> I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
use quicker process for me plus if I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.550 
use quicker process for me plus if I
want<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.450> cut<00:03:31.660> out<00:03:31.810> using<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.290> gel

want to I can cut out using a gel

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.310 
want to I can cut out using a gel
entirely<00:03:33.040> because<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.670> does<00:03:33.850> hold<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.930> one

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
entirely because it does hold the one

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.349
