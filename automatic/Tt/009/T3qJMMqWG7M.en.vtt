00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
see you could hear the car going up in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
see you could hear the car going up in
the<00:01:59.040> rpms<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> tire

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the rpms but you don't see the tire

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.660 
the rpms but you don't see the tire
spinning<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.560> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:02.009> you're

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
spinning so that's when you know you're

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.219 
spinning so that's when you know you're
getting<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> speed<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.049> not

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
getting a little bit of speed but not

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.289 
getting a little bit of speed but not
enough<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.829> want<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.159> more<00:02:05.369> than<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
enough you want to do more than that so

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.540
