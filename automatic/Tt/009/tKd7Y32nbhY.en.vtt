know<00:04:30.010> there's<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.340> study<00:04:30.669> out<00:04:30.729> of<00:04:30.940> Iowa<00:04:31.180> State

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
know there's a study out of Iowa State

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.880 
know there's a study out of Iowa State
just<00:04:31.630> last<00:04:31.840> week<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.200> said<00:04:32.380> about<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.620> four

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
just last week that said about a four

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.830 
just last week that said about a four
and<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.010> half<00:04:33.040> percent<00:04:33.580> reduction<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:34.660> that's

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
and a half percent reduction so that's

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.960 
and a half percent reduction so that's
certainly<00:04:35.020> not<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.680> know<00:04:35.770> maybe<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.100> 25<00:04:36.580> 30

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
certainly not the you know maybe a 25 30

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.310 
certainly not the you know maybe a 25 30
cent<00:04:37.240> reduction<00:04:37.690> that's<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.110> type<00:04:38.260> of

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
cent reduction that's not the type of
