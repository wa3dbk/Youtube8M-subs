have<00:01:55.980> been<00:01:56.040> simmering<00:01:56.820> nice<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> gently<00:01:57.810> for

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
have been simmering nice and gently for

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.360 
have been simmering nice and gently for
about<00:01:58.020> 50<00:01:58.470> minutes<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.920> quickly<00:01:59.130> that's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
about 50 minutes kind of quickly that's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.740 
about 50 minutes kind of quickly that's
just<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> juice<00:02:00.060> that's<00:02:00.270> been<00:02:00.450> released<00:02:00.570> from

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
just the juice that's been released from

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.390 
just the juice that's been released from
the<00:02:00.840> strawberries<00:02:01.230> this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.680> my<00:02:01.800> killer<00:02:02.100> sugar

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
the strawberries this is my killer sugar

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100 
the strawberries this is my killer sugar
with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.670> petting<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.510> as<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.690> make<00:02:03.900> mine

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
with the petting in it as I make mine

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
with the petting in it as I make mine
really<00:02:04.440> simply<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.220> basically<00:02:05.520> just

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
really simply and basically just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
really simply and basically just
chuckhole<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> stir<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
chuckhole in and you need to stir it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
chuckhole in and you need to stir it
until<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:10.619> dissolved<00:02:11.370> which<00:02:12.239> only<00:02:12.690> really

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
until it's dissolved which only really

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.750 
until it's dissolved which only really
takes<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.650> minute<00:02:14.129> or<00:02:14.160> two<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.519> it's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
takes a minute or two because it's

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.140 
takes a minute or two because it's
really<00:02:15.090> hot<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.660> already

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.940 

now<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.300> time<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> put<00:02:21.720> my<00:02:21.750> lemon<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.590> just

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
now it's time to put my lemon in so just

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010 
now it's time to put my lemon in so just
a<00:02:23.130> nice<00:02:23.370> lemon<00:02:24.090> squeeze<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.720> through<00:02:24.750> your

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
a nice lemon squeeze it through your

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.890 
a nice lemon squeeze it through your
hands<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> cash<00:02:25.530> tips<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.210> lemon<00:02:27.600> also

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
hands the cash tips and the lemon also

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.990 
hands the cash tips and the lemon also
helps<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> set<00:02:28.920> that's<00:02:29.250> quite<00:02:29.490> an<00:02:29.550> important

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
helps it set that's quite an important

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.730 
helps it set that's quite an important
part<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:31.080> need<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.260> simmer<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
part of it and we need to simmer it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.960 
part of it and we need to simmer it
until<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.310> gets<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.520> something<00:02:32.820> called

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
until it gets to something called

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.940 
until it gets to something called
setting<00:02:33.510> point<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.050> setting<00:02:34.530> point<00:02:34.710> is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
setting point and setting point is

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.610 
setting point and setting point is
basically<00:02:35.520> when<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.240> sugars<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:37.110> risen<00:02:37.440> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
basically when the sugars have risen to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
basically when the sugars have risen to
a<00:02:37.650> woman<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.520> temperature<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:38.970> when<00:02:39.150> they

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a woman up temperature that when they

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.260 
a woman up temperature that when they
cool<00:02:39.600> they<00:02:40.230> will<00:02:40.410> set<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.610> sort<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> jelly

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
cool they will set as a sort of a jelly

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.290 
cool they will set as a sort of a jelly
or<00:02:42.450> Jam<00:02:42.750> they'll<00:02:43.560> probably<00:02:43.740> take<00:02:44.100> about<00:02:44.850> 20

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
or Jam they'll probably take about 20

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.380 
or Jam they'll probably take about 20
minutes<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.730> does<00:02:47.910> need<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> be<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
minutes so it does need to be on a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.260 
minutes so it does need to be on a
furious<00:02:49.290> boil<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.460> need<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> stir<00:02:50.970> every

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
furious boil but you need to stir every

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.970 
furious boil but you need to stir every
now<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.510> then<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.750> make<00:02:51.900> sure<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.800> sugar

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
now and then to make sure that the sugar

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.190 
now and then to make sure that the sugar
doesn't<00:02:53.220> burn<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.670> bottom<00:02:53.700> now<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.720> need

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
doesn't burn on the bottom now you need

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.780 
doesn't burn on the bottom now you need
to<00:02:55.350> reach<00:02:55.560> something<00:02:55.770> called<00:02:56.070> setting<00:02:56.550> point

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to reach something called setting point

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.370 
to reach something called setting point
and<00:02:57.000> there's<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.360> couple<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.660> ways<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.140> find

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and there's a couple of ways to find

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.420 
and there's a couple of ways to find
that<00:02:58.500> out<00:02:58.680> first<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.160> could<00:02:59.280> use<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that out first of all you could use a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.980 
that out first of all you could use a
thermometer<00:02:59.700> this<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.210> kind<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> classic

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
thermometer this is a kind of classic

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.290 
thermometer this is a kind of classic
Jam<00:03:01.590> thermometer<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.310> leave<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.210> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
Jam thermometer you leave that in in the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.730 
Jam thermometer you leave that in in the
side<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.230> could<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.470> something<00:03:04.710> a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
side there or you could do something a

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.800 
side there or you could do something a
bit<00:03:04.770> more<00:03:05.070> scientific<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.240> thermo<00:03:06.630> pen

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
bit more scientific this is a thermo pen

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.150 
bit more scientific this is a thermo pen
they're<00:03:06.960> really<00:03:07.230> cool<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.680> they're<00:03:07.830> they're

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
they're really cool and they're they're

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.530 
they're really cool and they're they're
just<00:03:08.460> really<00:03:08.700> simple<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
just really simple to use the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.150 
just really simple to use the
temperature<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.410> get<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
temperature you want to get to is

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.080 
temperature you want to get to is
between<00:03:11.670> 104<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.110> 105<00:03:13.770> point<00:03:14.490> five<00:03:14.760> degrees

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
between 104 and 105 point five degrees

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940 
between 104 and 105 point five degrees
now<00:03:15.240> what's<00:03:15.840> weird<00:03:16.170> about<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.770> that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
now what's weird about this is that

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.050 
now what's weird about this is that
although<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.460> gets<00:03:17.580> up<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> high

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
although it gets up to a high

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.910 
although it gets up to a high
temperature<00:03:18.240> really<00:03:18.690> quickly<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.260> then<00:03:19.530> takes

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
temperature really quickly it then takes

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.630 
temperature really quickly it then takes
forever<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:21.240> get<00:03:21.630> up<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.990> 105<00:03:22.770> sometimes<00:03:23.460> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
forever to get up to 105 sometimes it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.220 
forever to get up to 105 sometimes it
can<00:03:23.880> even<00:03:24.000> take<00:03:24.240> up<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.480> half<00:03:24.510> an<00:03:24.900> hour<00:03:25.020> on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
can even take up to half an hour on

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.740 
can even take up to half an hour on
average<00:03:25.520> around<00:03:26.520> there<00:03:26.820> it's<00:03:27.210> got<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.510> about

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
average around there it's got to about

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.820 
average around there it's got to about
105<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.370> turn<00:03:29.550> out<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.620> don't

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
105 so we can turn out now if you don't

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.980 
105 so we can turn out now if you don't
have<00:03:32.100> thermometers<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.480> fine<00:03:33.750> because

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
have thermometers that is fine because

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.020 
have thermometers that is fine because
there's<00:03:34.290> another<00:03:34.680> really<00:03:35.160> cool<00:03:35.370> test<00:03:35.670> what

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
there's another really cool test what
