00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.150
 good development is actually going on 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 steadily steadily upwards for ten years i 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 think that I feed back too 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.059
 really good youth work too since 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.910
 The whole thing is done for ten twelve years 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.200
 concept has been changed 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.840
 despite that we have such a small one 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 we always bring good ones 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 play out 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
 the league in switzerland is actually 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 Good for young players who can first 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 their first 50 70 or even 100 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 make switzerland players and themselves 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 there then present in the big ones 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 to go to European leagues and that has 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.350
 of course, a positive positive 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 impact on the national team 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 I think it goes up and also 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.750
 there is a lot of potential right now 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750
 there and the team is still very young 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 the strengths of the current 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 national team are a bit 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.000
 other than ours before the age of six 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.130
 seven eight years we were really 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 many swiss really swiss 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.180
 citizen national player very much 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.979
 disciplined still like the Swiss 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 will work but we had 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.260
 there is less creativity these days 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.510
 many players with migration background 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.210
 they bring in that sense of creativity 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.940
 this trail craze also pure me 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.220
 think of shaqiri sanchez to dzemailis around 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.369
 really good players in the offensive 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.710
 area and currently has just one 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.240
 good mix of disciplined 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.000
 play defensively and yet the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 talented offensive play in the team 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 and I think that will be in the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.830
 next years, if I'm like that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 I see something in Swiss football 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.009
 offspring still currently developing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.009
 become 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.420
 a big one to the current one 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.370
 national team I would because he 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
 This team has also shaped the team 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.379
 last years he thinks so too 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.859
 this the winner mentality 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.989
 Also brought a bit 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.269
 this mentality infuses this 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 we were missing a bit earlier 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.250
 he has that as German 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.290
 citizen brought along by the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 bundesliga from his unite 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.379
 want and have been with humans too 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.629
 he entered the team 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.290
 and I think that's why he's the one 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.290
 Switzerland helped a lot 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.990
 the meaning was already very big 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.030
 I think that was about the whole thing 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.680
 world a small country in switzerland 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.630
 World Cup champion will be there too 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 only u17 is but that is of course already 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.050
 a big success 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.290
 Of course it has the whole thing 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.200
 junior work that is done 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.730
 approved 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 it is also confirmed in it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.360
 continue to work even more meticulously 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.920
 will invest even more 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.780
 and of course there is for every boy 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.030
 players still a big incentive 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.280
 to play football and that is it 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.570
 really worth it 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 in the meantime many players are this one 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.890
 team so many 56 players this 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.630
 Team are in the national team that is 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.340
 so much if you are 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.010
 Becoming world champion is called u17 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.660
 not that the eleven players then all the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.550
 so jump still further away 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.410
 but it is in the last country game 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.470
 I believe four to five players here 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.470
 been 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.670
 the team will continue 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.740
 develop because she is still young 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.140
 that's like having a day player in there 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.750
 philippe senderos johan djourou die 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.490
 some experience to bring the well 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.290
 but we have to go against the 30 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.850
 actually no l no old but 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.410
 old players are very many 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.780
 young player viable player 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.750
 who have already benefited from the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.690
 share world championship 2010 who in the 214th 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.930
 and I think that's for two 16 and 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.570
 218 have much more experience 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.650
 That's why this team will be 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.480
 to get even better 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.040
 Nevertheless, the expectations of the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.080
 Switzerland we are always realistic 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.790
 a little football country and if we are 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.430
 the group phase survive with an em 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.800
 or wm is that's that's that very well 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.420
 and then most of the time he is everything 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.190
 possible but it is already that way 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.070
 against Argentina really top game 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.360
 has done the best and then it is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.990
 also the more bitter that one then 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.990
 resigns
