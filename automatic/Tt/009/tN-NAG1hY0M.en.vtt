00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
nails and then they'll let the base

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:16.250 
nails and then they'll let the base
called<00:01:01.410> dry<00:01:01.649> completely

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.860 

and<00:01:16.590> after<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.820> apply<00:01:18.270> white<00:01:18.540> nail
