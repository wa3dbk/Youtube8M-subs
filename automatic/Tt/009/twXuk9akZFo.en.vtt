00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
is very fun I do recommend using this

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.940 
is very fun I do recommend using this
using<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.150> ban<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.660> more<00:03:01.900> wider<00:03:02.170> tracks<00:03:02.620> you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
using this ban on more wider tracks you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.310 
using this ban on more wider tracks you
can<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.970> would<00:03:04.120> think<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.540> narrower<00:03:04.900> tracks

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
can as I would think the narrower tracks

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.230 
can as I would think the narrower tracks
would<00:03:05.590> be<00:03:05.740> pretty<00:03:06.040> difficult<00:03:06.120> only<00:03:07.120> because

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
would be pretty difficult only because

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.110 
would be pretty difficult only because
of<00:03:07.420> how<00:03:07.630> long<00:03:07.990> this<00:03:08.230> vehicle<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.000> know

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
of how long this vehicle is but you know

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.780 
of how long this vehicle is but you know
what<00:03:10.320> on<00:03:11.320> most<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.830> tracks<00:03:12.100> this<00:03:12.370> vehicle

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
what on most of the tracks this vehicle

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.850 
what on most of the tracks this vehicle
should<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.150> fine<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:14.320> tell<00:03:14.590> me<00:03:14.620> what<00:03:14.800> you
