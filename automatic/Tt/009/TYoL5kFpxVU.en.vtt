00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.269
 Hello and my delicious 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.449
 Let's take a look at the smb001 model today. 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.890
 At present, as in 10th grade 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 I have a 22-inch story. 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.379
 ltd and the illustrator are the lunar window window 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909
 Beginning of the table showing the individual exhibits that can be interrupted without 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:31.980
 In the pc room 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.790
 It means 24 hours. 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.300
 So in October, Walt Disney will be Walt Disney 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.880
 I've stopped all classes now. 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.130
 This is the movement of the Chichiichi Otto 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.500
 The function is working. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 Operation 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 When there is no 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 To save energy 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.960
 In the sky and out. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 The market is starting now. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.410
 Stopped needles 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.840
 At the set time 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.800
 Start moving 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.840
 Even if the files are frozen 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
 The date continues to move on and on. 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 It is pointing to the coming 22nd 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.160
 So surely 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.370
 Things to do 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.500
 Move 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
 I will take it exactly 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.580
 If you do this once, 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 The term of photo g is floating 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 For up to six months 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.110
 Do not move 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.150
 The exact time will appear in the saved state 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.600
 Greek local 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.280
 Time 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.589
 To reveal the date 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.589
 It's moving. 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.959
 And this time 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 Let's see how to set the date and time. 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.679
 Right yen rate 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.509
 Why did you ask Mr. Yoo for help? 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.509
 You can choose a date. 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 As a result, 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.399
 Mr. Power 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.839
 You can edit it. 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.839
 In June 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.339
 In any case 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.789
 Up to one year 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.909
 together 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 I can watch. 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.719
 Fluoride in 2010, Kim Mi Yeon 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.519
 Because + is open, at +2 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.029
 Become a category force. 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.330
 Last year, 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.260
 Once more 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.329
 Pick 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.759
 To the end of 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.869
 If you call 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.359
 Can I have the settings at any time? 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.430
 After settingaliasing use 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.789
 Directing Google 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.579
 Needles start moving 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.969
 So today, Seiko Epson 200 is the model setting method 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.609
 I looked at how Otto Seibu works. 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.519
 Today, I was like a natsu 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.279
 Thank you
