you<00:01:58.119> know<00:01:58.270> styles<00:01:59.049> change<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> one<00:02:00.579> thing

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
you know styles change but the one thing

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.730 
you know styles change but the one thing
that<00:02:00.969> I<00:02:01.000> realized<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:01.930> whatever<00:02:02.500> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
that I realized is that whatever you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
that I realized is that whatever you
tell<00:02:02.950> your<00:02:03.159> stories<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:05.200> never<00:02:05.409> changes<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
tell your stories that never changes and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.380 
tell your stories that never changes and
I<00:02:07.479> always<00:02:08.229> tell<00:02:08.799> people<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.610> I'll<00:02:09.970> tell<00:02:10.209> you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
I always tell people and I'll tell you

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.170 
I always tell people and I'll tell you
again<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.650> need<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.160> wait<00:02:12.489> until<00:02:12.790> you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
again that you need to wait until you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.670 
again that you need to wait until you
have<00:02:13.390> stories<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.349> have

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
have stories to have

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.420 
have stories to have
that<00:02:14.799> is<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.400> think<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.480> best<00:02:16.689> safeguard

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that is I think it's the best safeguard

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.860 
that is I think it's the best safeguard
because<00:02:18.430> styles<00:02:18.849> are<00:02:18.969> gonna<00:02:19.090> change

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because styles are gonna change

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.709 
because styles are gonna change

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
of something and I put it on my wall and

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.929 
of something and I put it on my wall and
I<00:02:25.079> get<00:02:26.079> tired<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.650> after<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:27.010> while<00:02:27.250> even<00:02:27.519> if

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
I get tired of it after a while even if

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.759 
I get tired of it after a while even if
I<00:02:28.060> loved<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.569> at<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.750> beginning<00:02:28.870> 20<00:02:29.590> years

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
I loved it at the beginning 20 years

with our tattoos as well and the only
thing<00:02:37.209> that's<00:02:37.420> enduring<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.409> you<00:02:38.530> tell

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769
