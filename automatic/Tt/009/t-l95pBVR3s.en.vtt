actually<00:01:42.270> managed<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> make<00:01:43.079> ourselves<00:01:44.060> into

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
actually managed to make ourselves into

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.819 
actually managed to make ourselves into
leave<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.720> makes<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> mistake<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
leave because he makes a mistake to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
leave because he makes a mistake to
counteract<00:01:47.369> our<00:01:47.579> first<00:01:48.000> mistake<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> the

counteract our first mistake in the
first<00:01:49.110> color<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.090> balanced<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.570> we're

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
first color so it balanced out and we're

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.080 
first color so it balanced out and we're
gonna<00:01:51.930> open<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> deck<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> cards<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.939> see

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
worst player on a six page because it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
worst player on a six page because it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
was a red suit and that's not bad

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
was a red suit and that's not bad
because<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.710> actually<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.100> ultimate<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> we

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
because we actually get ultimate and we

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.219 
because we actually get ultimate and we
needed<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.210> sentimental<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.110> taken

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
needed a sentimental I would have taken

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.260 
needed a sentimental I would have taken
a<00:02:07.530> strike<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:08.129> Senate<00:02:08.429> forward<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.849> just

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
a strike a Senate forward and just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
a strike a Senate forward and just
shoved<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.929> sentiment<00:02:10.259> spot<00:02:10.500> what

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
shoved them in that sentiment spot what

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
shoved them in that sentiment spot what
do<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.129> actually<00:02:11.220> get<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:12.000> sentiment<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
do we actually get a sentiment and so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.700 
do we actually get a sentiment and so
it's<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:13.260> actually<00:02:13.349> that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's not actually that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.970 
just a bit I didn't expect it all I was
expecting<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.660> play<00:02:27.900> someone<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.590> a

expecting to have to play someone in a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
expecting to have to play someone in a

didn't care anymore into him to make

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.730 
didn't care anymore into him to make
sure<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.510> had<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.930> fitness<00:02:34.290> thing<00:02:34.440> going

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740

and this guy have to fire that seemed

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.930 
and this guy have to fire that seemed
very<00:02:36.780> very<00:02:37.020> strong<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.560> well<00:02:37.800> Balotelli<00:02:38.700> up

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
very very strong as well Balotelli up

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600 
very very strong as well Balotelli up
front<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:40.080> struggled<00:02:40.980> against<00:02:41.310> five<00:02:41.520> of

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
front and I struggled against five of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.860 
front and I struggled against five of
the<00:02:41.670> back<00:02:41.760> tubes<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.150> you'd<00:02:42.360> expect<00:02:42.480> it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the back tubes as you'd expect it's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.200 
the back tubes as you'd expect it's
genuinely<00:02:43.320> really<00:02:43.980> tough<00:02:44.280> he<00:02:44.400> does<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
genuinely really tough he does get the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.120 
genuinely really tough he does get the
first<00:02:45.540> goal<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.900> don't<00:02:46.080> know<00:02:46.140> how<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.410> player

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
first goal I don't know how I player

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.970 
first goal I don't know how I player
didn't<00:02:47.580> cover<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.140> does<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:49.770> matter

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
didn't cover that but it does not matter

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.880 
didn't cover that but it does not matter
so<00:02:50.520> we<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.510> really<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:52.440> pass<00:02:52.710> this

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
so we have to really really pass this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.770 
so we have to really really pass this
about<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.670> break<00:02:53.880> down<00:02:54.060> despite<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> back<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
a lovely little bit movement there to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.340 
a lovely little bit movement there to
get<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.880> first<00:02:57.120> goal<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.750> equalizer

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
little bit crazy but I really didn't

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.440

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and we go and get some more contrast

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.540 
and we go and get some more contrast
because<00:03:31.080> it's<00:03:31.680> getting<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.100> point<00:03:32.400> again

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.280 
team and I always say this is probably
one<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.150> most<00:03:48.300> solid<00:03:48.660> formation<00:03:49.050> sitting

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
one of the most solid formation sitting

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.670 
one of the most solid formation sitting
because<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.590> got<00:03:49.740> no<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.490> real<00:03:51.680> terrible

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the counter players you can use with it

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.120
