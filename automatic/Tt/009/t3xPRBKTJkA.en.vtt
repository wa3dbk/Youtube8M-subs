normally<00:02:47.450> easily<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> mission

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
normally easily just have a mission

get a lot of the same components
you<00:02:56.299> still<00:02:56.510> get<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.660> great<00:02:56.900> mission<00:02:57.200> frame<00:02:57.440> we

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you still get the great mission frame we

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.410 
you still get the great mission frame we
designed<00:02:58.310> knuckle<00:02:58.610> box<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.120> still<00:02:59.330> get
