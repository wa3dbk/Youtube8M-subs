00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello, special greetings for Victoria 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.719
 Mary who came up with this tag and so 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 first question how did your first find out 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 About monster high I saw video reviews 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 puppet on yutyube that pushed you 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.510
 buy the first doll or start them 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 collect most likely what 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.830
 each doll is unique in its own way and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 they are generally all different guns different faces 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.340
 various hands of all who claws who 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 the report still does not really want to make up 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 nails but probably won't do it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.680
 I do not like when the dolls are made under 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
 a carbon copy that is just the same 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 same doll painted in different 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.629
 colors and this type is issued as if it were 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.550
 all different and like equestria girls they 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.680
 still one headquarters doll zeros and this is supposedly 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.100
 of this here flatsher of this from applejack and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.140
 like they are all different 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 how many dolls do you have at the moment 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.909
 I currently have 11 dolls yours 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.420
 I bought my first doll right away two 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.760
 dolls it was a basic raschel and and 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.630
 drakulaura from the collection there Th-blah 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.770
 bla shoes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 she had a lot of shoes if you had 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.590
 favorite cartoon character probably 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.119
 but not be there so our arabica 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 favorite doll from the collection 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.360
 I don't have a favorite doll because 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 only those from the heap fall into my collection 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 these dolls which are very working to me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.000
 much liked and i'm not so there 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 stepper richer his buying things all 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 in a row but my mom like favorite 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.110
 the doll is this that's cool because she 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.729
 says that this is the beauty is stronger 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.189
 when looking at not tekis ready 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.549
 scary here it is straight sweetie therefore 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.820
 on but i love everybody on what hero are you 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.479
 similar honestly I don't know well maybe 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.350
 if only yours be there because 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.370
 she is 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.920
 and shy but in general it seems to me that I 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 as unique as each character and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 so I'm probably not like anyone 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.920
 which monster hi doll would you like 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.790
 I would like my collection very much 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.210
 toraley which is from the collection of coffin bin 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.580
 I can not find anywhere and every time 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.190
 I see somewhere that someone is writing but 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 this child I am and I am such a ear 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 need to run faster buy take money 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:48.690
 such a run ran and there is no 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 you ask the sellers that you are somewhere but 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.710
 it's over i'm so no garage yes and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 I would still very much like yours because I donâ€™t 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.200
 merge eyes in the dark or the day was 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.600
 at all 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.350
 miracle that she somehow was not treated 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.080
 the rest of the poison to these sadness is well for me 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.800
 do you need to buy something else with 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.240
 symbolism monster hi probably not but in 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.240
 At some point I really wanted to buy 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.630
 calendar I even tweeted about it but 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.560
 then I thought that my room and so 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.300
 not particularly similar to a room of this type and 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.340
 adult girls is there a big chance 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.800
 order to stop collecting 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.050
 these dolls do not know but until you go 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.530
 dolls that i like and who 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.330
 who are ready to dump their grandmother and 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.970
 while I have a new one on my shelf 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.520
 place though damn if it ends papni 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.570
 make a new 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.160
 buried from the local while you walk 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.390
 dolls no I will continue so far 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.270
 and here is my little collection from 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.710
 time, of course, it will be replenished 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.300
 I was very interested to shoot this 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.300
