I what's going on everybody welcome back
Callen<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.510> droid<00:00:06.779> life<00:00:06.990> again<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.470> I'd<00:00:08.069> say

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
Callen with droid life again and I'd say

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.470 
Callen with droid life again and I'd say
we're<00:00:08.430> going<00:00:08.549> to<00:00:08.610> take<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> look<00:00:08.969> at<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.120> asus

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
we're going to take a look at the asus

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.620 
we're going to take a look at the asus
transformer<00:00:09.870> pad<00:00:10.320> infinity<00:00:11.030> so<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
transformer pad infinity so this is

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
transformer pad infinity so this is
basically<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.139> upgraded<00:00:13.679> transformer<00:00:14.280> prime

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
basically the upgraded transformer prime

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
basically the upgraded transformer prime
you<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> came<00:00:15.330> out<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> end<00:00:15.840> of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
you know that came out at the end of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.550 
you know that came out at the end of
2011<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:18.119> big<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.540> here<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> screen

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
2011 the big thing here is the screen

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280 
2011 the big thing here is the screen
it's<00:00:19.770> got<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.919> 1920<00:00:20.669> x<00:00:20.759> 1200<00:00:21.119> resolution<00:00:21.390> so

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
it's got a 1920 x 1200 resolution so

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.139 
it's got a 1920 x 1200 resolution so
we're<00:00:22.439> getting<00:00:22.560> down<00:00:22.860> that<00:00:23.160> retina<00:00:23.669> path<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:24.149 
we're getting down that retina path a

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.970 
we're getting down that retina path a
little<00:00:24.180> bit<00:00:24.480> here<00:00:24.779> other<00:00:25.500> than<00:00:25.649> that<00:00:25.739> they've

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
little bit here other than that they've

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.979 
little bit here other than that they've
jumped<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.910> tiger<00:00:27.390> three<00:00:27.540> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.840> bit

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
jumped up the tiger three a little bit

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.479 
jumped up the tiger three a little bit
it's<00:00:28.110> actually<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> newer<00:00:28.680> tiger<00:00:29.009> three<00:00:29.220> called

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
it's actually a newer tiger three called

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.749 
it's actually a newer tiger three called
the<00:00:29.640> t-33<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.809> it<00:00:31.230> clogs<00:00:31.470> clocked<00:00:31.829> up<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> 1.6

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the t-33 and it clogs clocked up to 1.6

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.810 
the t-33 and it clogs clocked up to 1.6
gigahertz<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.780> jump<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.370> 1.7<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gigahertz but it can jump up to 1.7 the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.070 
gigahertz but it can jump up to 1.7 the
regular<00:00:36.210> tiger<00:00:36.480> three<00:00:36.630> that's<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.990> the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
regular tiger three that's in the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.750 
regular tiger three that's in the
transformer<00:00:37.500> Prime's<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.100> point<00:00:38.250> 3<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.640> 1

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
transformer Prime's at one point 3 and 1

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
transformer Prime's at one point 3 and 1
point<00:00:38.970> 4<00:00:39.240> gigahertz<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.080> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.410> faster

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
point 4 gigahertz so a little bit faster

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
point 4 gigahertz so a little bit faster
I'm<00:00:41.070> still<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.970> one<00:00:42.180> gig<00:00:42.360> around<00:00:42.630> not<00:00:42.810> two

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I'm still just one gig around not two

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.540 
I'm still just one gig around not two
gigs<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> we're<00:00:43.770> seeing<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.310> know<00:00:44.400> like

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
gigs like we're seeing in you know like

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.140 
gigs like we're seeing in you know like
the<00:00:44.670> galaxy<00:00:45.030> s3<00:00:45.330> into<00:00:45.510> new<00:00:45.630> phones<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.740> it's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
the galaxy s3 into new phones but it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.930 
the galaxy s3 into new phones but it's
ddr3<00:00:48.150> that's<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.840> 1600<00:00:49.680> megahertz<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.400> we

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
ddr3 that's up to 1600 megahertz so we

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.690 
ddr3 that's up to 1600 megahertz so we
got<00:00:51.060> some<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.270> speed<00:00:51.570> their<00:00:51.840> bluetooth<00:00:52.680> 30<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
got some more speed their bluetooth 30 a

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.140 
got some more speed their bluetooth 30 a
revamped<00:00:54.420> 8<00:00:54.690> megapixel<00:00:55.290> camera<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> yeah

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
revamped 8 megapixel camera and yeah

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150 
revamped 8 megapixel camera and yeah
overall<00:00:57.630> it's<00:00:57.750> basically<00:00:58.050> uh<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.800> said<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
overall it's basically uh like I said a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.780 
overall it's basically uh like I said a
revamped<00:00:59.790> transformer<00:01:00.750> prime<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.640> say

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
revamped transformer prime so when I say

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.660 
revamped transformer prime so when I say
it's<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.450> transformer<00:01:04.379> prime<00:01:04.670> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's just like the transformer prime it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
it's just like the transformer prime it
has<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.939> docking<00:01:06.390> capabilities<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
has all the docking capabilities so it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.030 
has all the docking capabilities so it
actually<00:01:07.890> does<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> keyboard<00:01:09.210> dock<00:01:09.690> and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
actually does have a keyboard dock and

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.550 
actually does have a keyboard dock and
so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.940> see<00:01:12.870> that<00:01:12.990> tf201

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so you can see this see that tf201

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
so you can see this see that tf201
that's<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> model<00:01:14.400> number<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that's the model number for the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
that's the model number for the
transformer<00:01:15.630> prime<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.260> same<00:01:16.500> dock<00:01:16.770> with

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
transformer prime so the same dock with

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
transformer prime so the same dock with
the<00:01:17.070> prime<00:01:17.450> works<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> transformer<00:01:19.200> pad

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the prime works with the transformer pad

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
the prime works with the transformer pad
infinity<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:20.190> we'll<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.670> later<00:01:21.030> on

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
infinity so we'll go over that later on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.000 
infinity so we'll go over that later on
I<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.840> wanted<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> show<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.290> guys<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
I just wanted to show you guys that the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.670 
I just wanted to show you guys that the
docking<00:01:24.000> station<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> same<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.380> case<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
docking station is the same in case you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.750 
docking station is the same in case you
were<00:01:25.770> thinking<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.190> upgrading<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
were thinking about upgrading you

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.520 
were thinking about upgrading you
already<00:01:26.940> have<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> doc<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.380> get

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
already have the doc you actually do get

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
already have the doc you actually do get
to<00:01:28.650> keep<00:01:28.830> that<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.190> use<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.390> anyways

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to keep that just use it so anyways

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.210 
to keep that just use it so anyways
let's<00:01:30.780> open<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.920> take<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> look

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
let's open this up and just take a look

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.070 
let's open this up and just take a look
quickly<00:01:32.490> again<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.330> unboxing<00:01:33.659> will

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
quickly again this just an unboxing will

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.170 
quickly again this just an unboxing will
do<00:01:34.170> full<00:01:34.470> review<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> stuff<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.310> later

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
do full review and stuff like that later

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
do full review and stuff like that later
on<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.490> tablet<00:01:39.450> set<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> over

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
on so here is the tablet set that over

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.120 
on so here is the tablet set that over
here<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> second<00:01:41.100> I'm<00:01:41.640> inside<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.600> uh

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
here for a second I'm inside is your uh

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
here for a second I'm inside is your uh

this would be a day cleaning cloth and
then<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:55.280> power<00:01:56.280> adapter<00:01:57.150> I<00:01:57.420> don't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
then here is your power adapter I don't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.090 
then here is your power adapter I don't
believe<00:01:58.170> there's<00:01:58.350> anything<00:01:58.560> else<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.010> the

believe there's anything else in the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.170 
believe there's anything else in the
nice<00:01:59.250> box<00:01:59.640> nope<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.810> should<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.830> uh<00:02:02.180> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
nice box nope that should be it so uh we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.020 
nice box nope that should be it so uh we
will<00:02:03.390> set<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> aside<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:04.860> alright<00:02:05.820> so

will set that aside as well alright so
isus<00:02:06.600> let's<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.650> we<00:02:07.740> run<00:02:07.920> down<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
isus let's see so if we run down the

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.140 
isus let's see so if we run down the
side<00:02:08.519> here<00:02:09.259> believe<00:02:10.259> these<00:02:10.439> herbs<00:02:11.029> there<00:02:12.029> we

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
side here believe these herbs there we

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.080 
side here believe these herbs there we
go<00:02:12.680> we<00:02:13.680> run<00:02:13.829> down<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> side<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:14.969> see

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
go we run down the side here you can see

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.339 
go we run down the side here you can see

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
first time um so first thing I'm

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.220 
first time um so first thing I'm
noticing<00:02:40.950> since<00:02:41.879> I<00:02:41.970> was<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> back<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:43.109> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
noticing since I was on the back is I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.399 
noticing since I was on the back is I
believe<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.709> new<00:02:43.980> strip<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.519> top<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
believe this new strip up top is

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.179 
believe this new strip up top is
different<00:02:46.409> than<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> Prime<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.069> I'm

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
different than the Prime and I'm

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.360 
different than the Prime and I'm
wondering<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.909> has<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.980> GPS<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.340> Wi-Fi

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
wondering if that has the GPS and Wi-Fi

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.009 
wondering if that has the GPS and Wi-Fi
in<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.239> remember<00:02:51.420> they<00:02:51.569> build<00:02:51.870> on

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
in there because remember they build on

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.479 
in there because remember they build on
the<00:02:52.079> transformer<00:02:52.530> prime<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.129> sorts<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
the transformer prime at all sorts of

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.759 
the transformer prime at all sorts of
issues<00:02:53.639> that<00:02:54.120> we're<00:02:54.629> stopping<00:02:54.989> Wi-Fi<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
issues that we're stopping Wi-Fi and

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.009 
issues that we're stopping Wi-Fi and
causing<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.609> know<00:02:56.730> GPS<00:02:57.299> did<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:57.659> ever<00:02:57.840> be

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
causing you know GPS did not ever be

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.240 
causing you know GPS did not ever be
able<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.200> lock<00:02:58.409> so<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.620> wondering<00:02:58.709> if<00:02:58.950> that's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
able to lock so I'm wondering if that's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.190 
able to lock so I'm wondering if that's
what<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.609> is<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.909> don't<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.629> can<00:03:00.900> ultras

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
what that is I don't know all can ultras

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.149 
what that is I don't know all can ultras
i'll<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.409> if<00:03:01.470> i<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.650> confirm<00:03:01.799> that<00:03:02.040> but

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
i'll see if i can confirm that but

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.770 
i'll see if i can confirm that but
anyways<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.879> comes<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.209> i<00:03:03.299> believe<00:03:03.329> these

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
anyways so it comes in i believe these

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.860 
anyways so it comes in i believe these
same<00:03:04.049> two<00:03:04.349> colors<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:05.189> amethyst<00:03:06.090> grey<00:03:06.480> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
same two colors that amethyst grey and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.360 
same two colors that amethyst grey and
then<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.109> goldish<00:03:07.620> color<00:03:07.889> that<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
then that goldish color that the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.610 
then that goldish color that the
transformer<00:03:08.939> prime<00:03:09.150> did<00:03:09.389> this<00:03:10.319> is<00:03:10.409> basically

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
transformer prime did this is basically

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.869 
transformer prime did this is basically
purple<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.189> i<00:03:11.220> think<00:03:11.400> they're<00:03:11.549> calling<00:03:11.819> an

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
purple but i think they're calling an

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.399 
purple but i think they're calling an
amethyst<00:03:12.209> grey<00:03:12.510> or<00:03:12.659> something<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.079> so

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
amethyst grey or something like that so

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.099 
amethyst grey or something like that so
we<00:03:14.159> can<00:03:14.310> take<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> little<00:03:14.579> bit<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.939> tour<00:03:15.269> as<00:03:15.659> I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
we can take a little bit of a tour as I

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.259 
we can take a little bit of a tour as I
pick<00:03:16.409> this<00:03:16.590> off<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.010> side<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.849> it's<00:03:18.030> still<00:03:18.239> a

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
pick this off the side so it's still a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.860 
pick this off the side so it's still a
10.1<00:03:18.810> inch<00:03:19.109> display<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:21.120> again<00:03:21.419> it's<00:03:21.720> that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
10.1 inch display but again it's that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.740 
10.1 inch display but again it's that
1920<00:03:22.620> x<00:03:22.739> 1200<00:03:23.099> resolution<00:03:23.370> that's<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> star

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
1920 x 1200 resolution that's the star

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.530 
1920 x 1200 resolution that's the star
here<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.980> front<00:03:26.609> camera<00:03:26.910> right<00:03:27.359> up

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
here you do have a front camera right up

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.069 
here you do have a front camera right up
there<00:03:28.579> charging<00:03:29.579> down<00:03:29.790> here<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.720> got<00:03:30.930> good

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
there charging down here so you got good
