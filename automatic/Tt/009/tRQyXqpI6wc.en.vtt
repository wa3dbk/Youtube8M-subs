 it's about more than 25 friends 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.290
 As time has passed we have already 25 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.090
 years that we have seen this series of 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 American football in any amount 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.870
 of consoles generation of players have 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.900
 experienced or since it emerged by 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.790
 beyond 1900 and so many in the comfortable and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.830
 that now with all technology reaches the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.119
 delivery of 5 nov las and it is as 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 Paula, do not talk to me about football 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.180
 American but surely the people who 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.310
 is not seeing them and the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 initialists because better because no 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.060
 we let alexandra tell them to 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 those who care that it is way of 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.360
 transit we are the least 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 and know 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.909
 gamers previous 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 madden 25 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.700
 there is no doubt that time flies by 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.770
 25 years ago that madden arose and what 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.170
 we saw for the first time on platforms 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.539
 like the comfortable 64 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.549
 since then the series has evolved 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.039
 together with each new generation of 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.130
 consoles looking to be the best game of 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.920
 most popular sport in the USA and that has 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.229
 won fans around the world little by little 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.509
 even though the fans have been 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.369
 not very satisfied with the latest 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.819
 deliveries by not having changes so 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.980
 substantial in the game with command in 25 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.110
 and there esports promises to give the next 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.599
 step to a new generation of 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.790
 experiences since in addition to being 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.120
 present in the new consoles like the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.280
 xbox one and foot 4 thanks to the use of 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.650
 new engine and technology called jack 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.530
 mike that was presented in the past e3 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.920
 the gaming experience will change by 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.620
 complete and esports ensures that with the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.810
 use of knight the game will have ten times 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 more detail this means that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 will have greater realism in the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.590
 Faces and clothes of the players 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.080
 but this change will also be noticeable in 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.480
 the design of stadiums crowds 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.690
 playing field and the effect of the ball 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.280
 but just as the visual is important what 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.319
 that defines a soccer game 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.260
 American is your control and intelligence 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.330
 artificial players will have the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.760
 ability to make better plays 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.160
 thanks to a renewed control with which 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.709
 stand cutting and changing direction 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.110
 during a play they never saw each other and 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.569
 they felt better and if to challenge the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.130
 linebackers is about intelligence 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.500
 artificial has been completely 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.019
 renewed for the player to be able 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.480
 of taking up to more than 50 decisions 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.519
 during a play that can make the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.250
 difference between being the champion of 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.440
 trophy vince lombardi or return home 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 like a loser 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.390
 how to jump to fallen players open the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.120
 path of the protection bag between 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.660
 other moves will be much more realistic 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.880
 we'll see the offensive lines and 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.220
 defensives will play their role and they will be the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.590
 heart of the game the force is not 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.510
 fought with intelligence and will now be 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.060
 more complicated to break the lines 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.030
 enemies so we will have to think and 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.370
 choose very well each play everything 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.620
 previous accompanied by crowds full 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.690
 of life and screaming on every play to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.960
 that you feel like you're in the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.690
 same stadium there is no doubt that it is wrong 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.210
 at 25 it looks very good but soon 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.160
 we will have the final verdict while 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.130
 so much I go preparing for the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.500
 Sundays soccer at home with friends to 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.500
 I almost forget you are invited
