he'll run over there if we won't climb
the<00:06:07.030> ladder<00:06:07.240> or<00:06:07.510> something<00:06:07.740> or<00:06:08.740> just<00:06:08.770> crawl

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
the ladder or something or just crawl

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.020 
the ladder or something or just crawl
back<00:06:09.790> and<00:06:10.300> swim<00:06:10.600> back<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.960> side<00:06:11.260> just

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
back and swim back to the side just

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.920 
back and swim back to the side just
we're<00:06:13.030> on<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.210> side<00:06:13.360> you<00:06:13.510> don't<00:06:13.540> need<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:13.810> go

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
we're on the side you don't need to go

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.340 
we're on the side you don't need to go
over<00:06:14.050> there<00:06:14.260> I<00:06:15.720> think<00:06:16.720> this<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.110> section

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
over there I think this is the section

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.610 
over there I think this is the section
where<00:06:18.389> kicks<00:06:19.389> cans<00:06:19.750> or<00:06:20.050> something<00:06:20.410> really

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
where kicks cans or something really

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.040 
where kicks cans or something really
stupid<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.190> these<00:06:22.030> PMC's<00:06:22.450> will<00:06:22.600> turn<00:06:22.750> around

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
stupid and these PMC's will turn around

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.320 
stupid and these PMC's will turn around
and<00:06:23.229> I'll<00:06:23.320> see<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:24.030> just<00:06:25.030> take<00:06:25.150> out<00:06:25.240> the

and I'll see you I just take out the

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.150 
and I'll see you I just take out the
PMC's<00:06:25.750> before<00:06:27.000> he<00:06:28.000> kicks<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.270> can<00:06:28.450> I<00:06:28.510> guess

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
PMC's before he kicks the can I guess

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.980 
PMC's before he kicks the can I guess
because<00:06:30.160> it's<00:06:30.280> a<00:06:30.460> bitch<00:06:30.640> cuz<00:06:30.910> hey<00:06:31.600> yeah<00:06:31.780> if<00:06:31.900> he

because it's a bitch cuz hey yeah if he

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.080 
because it's a bitch cuz hey yeah if he
gets<00:06:32.020> caught<00:06:32.350> he'll<00:06:32.620> run<00:06:32.979> like<00:06:33.400> all<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.940> way

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.540 
gets caught he'll run like all the way
back<00:06:34.360> to<00:06:34.419> some<00:06:34.720> other<00:06:34.810> area<00:06:35.200> and<00:06:35.440> then<00:06:36.340> when<00:06:36.490> he

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
back to some other area and then when he

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.300 
back to some other area and then when he
