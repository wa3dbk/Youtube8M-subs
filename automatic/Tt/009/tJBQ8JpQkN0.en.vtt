00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
look at the core steel coming through

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.980 
look at the core steel coming through
the<00:00:50.160> edge<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.540> see<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
the edge there and you can see the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
does have these hollow ground scalloped

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
does have these hollow ground scalloped
out<00:00:59.820> areas<00:01:00.420> or<00:01:00.720> reverse<00:01:01.050> dimples<00:01:01.530> whatever

out areas or reverse dimples whatever

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
out areas or reverse dimples whatever
you<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> call<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:04.079> intent<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you like to call them the intent on

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
you like to call them the intent on
these<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:05.939> nonstick

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
these is to have a little more nonstick

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.170 
these is to have a little more nonstick
properties<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> blade<00:01:07.640> I'm<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
properties to the blade I'm not sure and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.020 
properties to the blade I'm not sure and
practice<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.860> helps<00:01:11.159> they

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
practice how much that really helps they

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
practice how much that really helps they
didn't<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.390> display<00:01:12.870> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.110> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
didn't really display a lot of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
didn't really display a lot of
difference<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> put<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> knife

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
difference to me when I put this knife

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.290 
difference to me when I put this knife
to<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.909> use<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:16.430> overall<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> grind<00:01:17.909> itself

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
to some use but overall the grind itself

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.210 
to some use but overall the grind itself
is<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.110> blade<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.860> whether<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is very good on the blade so whether you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
is very good on the blade so whether you
get<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.549> version<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.150> whether<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
get this version or whether you get the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
get this version or whether you get the
one<00:01:21.870> without<00:01:22.170> these<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
one without these and there's the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.360 
one without these and there's the
straight<00:01:24.290> version<00:01:25.290> without<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> dimples<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
straight version without the dimples on

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.130 
straight version without the dimples on
it<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:26.970> they'll<00:01:27.090> either<00:01:27.240> perform<00:01:27.960> both

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it I think they'll either perform both

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.940 
it I think they'll either perform both
probably<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:29.070> equally<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.830> weight<00:01:31.830> on

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
probably pretty equally the weight on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.000 
probably pretty equally the weight on
this<00:01:32.130> knife<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.640> 7.1<00:01:33.390> ounces<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> 202<00:01:34.590> grams<00:01:34.830> so

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
this knife is 7.1 ounces a 202 grams so

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.350 
this knife is 7.1 ounces a 202 grams so
it's<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> super<00:01:35.610> lightweight<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.210> it's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's not a super lightweight but it's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.820 
it's not a super lightweight but it's
almost<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> western<00:01:37.200> style<00:01:37.320> handle

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
almost like a western style handle

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.050 
almost like a western style handle
weight<00:01:38.010> wise<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
weight wise so you have to take that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.760 
weight wise so you have to take that
into<00:01:39.659> consideration<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:41.210> blade<00:01:42.210> length<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
into consideration the blade length is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.730 
into consideration the blade length is
175<00:01:43.770> millimeters<00:01:44.700> 6.9<00:01:45.420> almost<00:01:45.930> 7<00:01:46.229> inches<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
175 millimeters 6.9 almost 7 inches and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
175 millimeters 6.9 almost 7 inches and
the<00:01:47.220> overall<00:01:47.250> length<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.150> twelve<00:01:48.900> point<00:01:49.200> three

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the overall length is twelve point three

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
the overall length is twelve point three
so<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.460> Tocco<00:01:50.760> has<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:51.030> good<00:01:51.180> length

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so this and Tocco has some good length

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.719 
so this and Tocco has some good length
to<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.590> spine<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> base<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.820> about<00:01:54.530> 2.3
