 the capital to ulan bator and the beautiful 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.580
 of the trip is that there does not end 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.170
 always the solidary factor in your 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.360
 Travel is like that 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.040
 explain to me then look at this trip man 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.659
 I think I always travel I 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.729
 has treated everyone very well the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.350
 travel also treats me well there is very good 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.720
 very good wave and always try 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.940
 return a little bit of this good roll 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080
 for what you can never the truth is that 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.180
 I had never organized anything at all 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.410
 I arrive at the sites and in the end it comes out in 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.150
 the conversations with the people that you 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.670
 matter come here and do this with 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.070
 children or with some women's association 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.259
 battered or raffles to help 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.330
 reach whatever and hope this time yes 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.160
 which is organized this time I want 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.229
 reach about 45 kilometers from the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.410
 capital of Ulaanbaatar to a small village 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.479
 visit a family of children with a 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.860
 series of problems are a few villages 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.560
 that there are near the capital that are 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.119
 very isolated, it takes about four hours 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.229
 get to do those forty-something 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.610
 kilometers and they were old Russian mines 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.899
 they pulled coal but they realized that 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.490
 this coal has a degree of 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 radioactivity and can not export it 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 then they completely abandoned 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 these people and these people and also 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 how do all the suburbs of the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.720
 needs there is a lot of alcoholism and 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.470
 children are without 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.780
 educate without literacy can not read 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.880
 write and then my mission the mission 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.910
 that I have put on that is yours 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.990
 is to enroll at least one child 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.390
 let's go to a family to live with 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.300
 them in a yucca that are some houses 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 circular nomads not nomadic people 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.330
 where they do not have running water that 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.990
 is also another thing that is being 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.200
 doing and then look at schooling a 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.880
 line and costs 180 euros is not nothing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.880
 I think that between all of us we are going to get 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.890
 more of that if we also get there 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.209
 to one thousand eight hundred euros we are going to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.850
 get this family that are 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.300
 four brothers and two cousins ​​who live 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.750
 in the same yurt have a house with 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.010
 floor electricity ceiling beds and table I 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.810
 I think you'll get it because a 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.120
 little that each one contributes 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.830
 So if I get quite sure 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.320
 what shape people who are in their homes 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.209
 You can contribute their bit as 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.920
 look on my website 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.750
 alice sornosa puntocom as you enter 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.640
 up on the right there is a little button that 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.370
 is to sell stickers and under there is 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.020
 one that donates or donates through 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.250
 paypal with credit card 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.200
 even if someone wants to make a 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.640
 transfer to an account of mine does not 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.540
 it's funny but good does not happen 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.180
 nothing 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.930
 donating there what you want a euro 235 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.700
 one hundred thousand what each one can 10,000 and 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.960
 every week I keep publishing the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.730
 people that unless someone tells me 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.090
 who wants to be anonymous I will go publishing 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.200
 who has gotten and how much for everything 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.400
 the world can take control of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.710
 money that there is that I'm not going to stay 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.280
 with no truth that's all for the 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.930
 children and good and apart for example here 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.160
 in a television garage they will be able to 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.950
 be watching the videos yes and donating or 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.100
 We will see weekly follow-ups 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.620
 of your adventures and tell me alicia 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.390
 that according to what areas to do 45 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.300
 kilometers you can take up to four 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.610
 hours where you're going to get it for 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.620
 get to these villages for 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.030
 that is on the road because I already tell you 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.400
 that the Russians left there they have 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.870
 left there abandoned then the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.390
 roads are in very poor condition but 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.980
 for that we go on a gs a motorbike 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.870
 great trail to get to the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.350
 end of everything and as far as it does not go 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.370
 nobody as you see is an efe 700 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.700
 that's my motorcycle and I think it can not 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.290
 separate from them and good as I've already 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.420
 checked and I know that this bike is not going to 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.070
 spend anything that is totally reliable the 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.220
 motor that is a motorcycle that is made 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.570

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.100

 spend nothing and if it happens to me as if not 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.800
