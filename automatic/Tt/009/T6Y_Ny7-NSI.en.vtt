00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
stable platform living here on the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600 
stable platform living here on the
Mississippi<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.750> I'll<00:01:39.900> stick<00:01:40.189> 620<00:01:41.189> yep

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
Mississippi I think I'll stick 620 yep
but<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> lived<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.710> Lake

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
but you know what if I lived on Lake

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.510 
but you know what if I lived on Lake
Erie<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.579> Green<00:01:44.880> Bay<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.750> old<00:01:46.170> Black's<00:01:46.770> Lake<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
Erie or Green Bay or old Black's Lake I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
Erie or Green Bay or old Black's Lake I
think<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> 621<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.320> thing<00:01:49.560> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
think I might have a 621 this thing just

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.550 
think I might have a 621 this thing just
crushes<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> waves<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> need<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> little

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
crushes the waves but I need a little

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
crushes the waves but I need a little
bit<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.009> pinpoint<00:01:53.579> accuracy<00:01:54.060> fish<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
bit more pinpoint accuracy fish in the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.499 
bit more pinpoint accuracy fish in the
Mississippi<00:01:55.200> River<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
Mississippi River so it's not really the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.330 
Mississippi River so it's not really the
boat<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.960> me<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.649> tell<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> extra

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
boat for me but I can tell the extra

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400 
boat for me but I can tell the extra
space<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.390> inches<00:02:00.750> wider

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
space in it it's two inches wider

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.250 
space in it it's two inches wider
that's<00:02:03.160> foot<00:02:03.460> 2<00:02:03.790> inches<00:02:04.090> longer<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.570> guess<00:02:04.720> yep

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
that's foot 2 inches longer I guess yep

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.090 
that's foot 2 inches longer I guess yep
and<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:07.120> think<00:02:08.050> it'd<00:02:08.140> be<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.290> little<00:02:08.440> tougher<00:02:08.920> for

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
and I think it'd be a little tougher for

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100 
and I think it'd be a little tougher for
me<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.369> fish<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.790> up<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.240> wing<00:02:10.420> dams<00:02:10.720> but

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
me to fish on up on the wing dams but

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.130 
me to fish on up on the wing dams but
you<00:02:11.260> know<00:02:11.380> what<00:02:11.680> I'd<00:02:12.340> feel<00:02:12.700> safer<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.630> other

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140
