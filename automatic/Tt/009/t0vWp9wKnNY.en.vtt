choose is going to depend upon the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.109 
choose is going to depend upon the
numbers<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:20.279> actually<00:00:20.460> given<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
numbers that are actually given to you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.140 
numbers that are actually given to you
in<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.330> problem<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.810> let's<00:00:22.020> leave<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.529> here

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
in your problem so let's leave this here

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.019 
in your problem so let's leave this here
and<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.210> won't<00:00:24.390> erase<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.710> let's<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.849> work

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and I won't erase it and let's just work

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.679 
and I won't erase it and let's just work
some<00:00:27.210> problem<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.470> let's<00:00:28.680> say<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.689> two

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
some problem so let's say we have two

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.549 
some problem so let's say we have two
plus<00:00:31.170> negative<00:00:31.769> six<00:00:32.809> two<00:00:33.809> plus<00:00:33.989> negative<00:00:34.140> six

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
plus negative six two plus negative six

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.229 
plus negative six two plus negative six
I've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> positive<00:00:35.489> plus<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> negative

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I've got a positive plus a negative

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
I've got a positive plus a negative
which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.860> case<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> case

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
which is this case and that's the case

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.940 
which is this case and that's the case
we<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.180> did<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> subtract<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.379> number<00:00:40.680> 6

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we just did so I subtract these number 6

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450 
we just did so I subtract these number 6
minus<00:00:41.280> 2<00:00:41.550> gives<00:00:42.270> me<00:00:42.420> 4<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.800> negative<00:00:44.040> sign

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
minus 2 gives me 4 and the negative sign

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
minus 2 gives me 4 and the negative sign
is<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.750> number<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is what I use because this number is the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.490 
is what I use because this number is the
bigger<00:00:46.620> absolute<00:00:47.160> value<00:00:47.489> wise<00:00:49.610> next<00:00:50.610> problem

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
bigger absolute value wise next problem

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.360 
bigger absolute value wise next problem
negative<00:00:52.500> 2<00:00:52.860> plus<00:00:53.430> negative<00:00:53.789> 6<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
negative 2 plus negative 6 so here I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
negative 2 plus negative 6 so here I
have<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> negative<00:00:56.879> plus<00:00:57.510> another<00:00:57.809> negative

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
have a negative plus another negative

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.170 
have a negative plus another negative
number<00:00:58.289> that's<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.039> case<00:00:59.430> where<00:01:00.149> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
number that's the other case where I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760 
number that's the other case where I
already<00:01:00.899> borrowed<00:01:01.140> something<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
already borrowed something and I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
already borrowed something and I
borrowed<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.489> stuff<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> answer

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
borrowed some more stuff so the answer

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.539 
borrowed some more stuff so the answer
is<00:01:03.329> negative<00:01:03.570> 8<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.229> 6<00:01:04.710> plus<00:01:04.920> 2<00:01:05.189> gives<00:01:05.430> me

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is negative 8 because 6 plus 2 gives me

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
is negative 8 because 6 plus 2 gives me
8<00:01:05.820> negative<00:01:06.780> plus<00:01:07.110> negative<00:01:07.350> always<00:01:07.770> gives<00:01:08.189> me

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
8 negative plus negative always gives me

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
8 negative plus negative always gives me
negative<00:01:08.430> 3<00:01:10.729> negative<00:01:12.200> 6<00:01:13.200> plus<00:01:13.860> 2<00:01:14.330> again<00:01:15.330> here

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
negative 3 negative 6 plus 2 again here

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.859 
negative 3 negative 6 plus 2 again here
it's<00:01:15.960> negative<00:01:16.409> plus<00:01:16.740> positive<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.299> they're

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's negative plus positive so they're

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
it's negative plus positive so they're
different<00:01:19.140> signs<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.830> they're<00:01:19.950> different<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
different signs when they're different I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.120 
different signs when they're different I
subtract<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:21.000> 6<00:01:21.240> minus<00:01:21.509> 2<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
subtract them 6 minus 2 is 4 and the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
subtract them 6 minus 2 is 4 and the
bigger<00:01:23.400> number<00:01:23.790> goes<00:01:24.320> absolute<00:01:25.320> value<00:01:25.560> lies

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bigger number goes absolute value lies

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
bigger number goes absolute value lies
is<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.130> sign<00:01:26.340> comes<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.759> notice<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
is where my sign comes from notice that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
is where my sign comes from notice that
number<00:01:27.750> 1<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> number<00:01:28.140> 3<00:01:28.500> give<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.710> exactly

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
number 1 and number 3 give me exactly

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
number 1 and number 3 give me exactly
the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.549> answer<00:01:29.759> 2<00:01:30.360> plus<00:01:30.720> negative<00:01:30.960> 6<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the same answer 2 plus negative 6 is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.410 
the same answer 2 plus negative 6 is
exactly<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> same<00:01:32.549> thing<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.850> negative<00:01:32.970> 6

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
exactly the same thing as negative 6

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.749

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
give me exactly the same answer and it
does<00:01:58.729> let's<00:01:59.729> say<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.060> negative<00:02:00.240> 6<00:02:00.750> plus

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
does let's say I have negative 6 plus

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.149 
does let's say I have negative 6 plus
negative<00:02:01.979> 2<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.780> again<00:02:04.439> same<00:02:04.680> thing<00:02:04.740> negative

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
negative 2 so again same thing negative

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.740 
negative 2 so again same thing negative
plus<00:02:05.490> negative<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.060> always<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> give<00:02:06.659> me

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
plus negative is always going to give me

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.719 
plus negative is always going to give me
negative<00:02:06.869> 6<00:02:07.320> plus<00:02:07.649> 2<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.069> always<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
negative 6 plus 2 is always going to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.389 
negative 6 plus 2 is always going to
give<00:02:08.879> me<00:02:09.000> 8

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
give me 8

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.949 
give me 8
is<00:02:09.849> when<00:02:10.030> they're<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.239> same<00:02:10.450> sign<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.899> that

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
is when they're the same sign like that

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.440 
is when they're the same sign like that
I<00:02:11.140> always<00:02:11.409> add<00:02:11.709> them<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.760> again<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> gives<00:02:13.269> me

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I always add them and again it gives me

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.819 
I always add them and again it gives me
the<00:02:13.569> same<00:02:13.750> answer<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.379> just<00:02:14.530> flipped

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
the same answer because I just flipped

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.729 
the same answer because I just flipped
the<00:02:14.920> order<00:02:16.439> so<00:02:17.439> let's<00:02:17.680> do<00:02:18.030> 14<00:02:19.030> plus<00:02:19.510> 6<00:02:19.739> that's

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the order so let's do 14 plus 6 that's

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.410 
the order so let's do 14 plus 6 that's
just<00:02:21.010> regular<00:02:21.159> addition<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:21.849> 20<00:02:22.269> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
just regular addition that's 20 and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.970 
just regular addition that's 20 and
let's<00:02:25.420> say<00:02:25.599> plus<00:02:25.750> because<00:02:26.140> positive<00:02:26.439> plus

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
let's say plus because positive plus

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.649 
let's say plus because positive plus
positive<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.459> positive<00:02:27.489> now<00:02:28.390> let's<00:02:28.540> say<00:02:28.629> I

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
positive is positive now let's say I

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.979 
positive is positive now let's say I
have<00:02:28.810> negative<00:02:29.230> 14<00:02:29.590> plus<00:02:29.859> 6<00:02:30.659> negative<00:02:31.659> plus

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
have negative 14 plus 6 negative plus

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.509 
have negative 14 plus 6 negative plus
positive<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.739> they're<00:02:32.859> different<00:02:33.040> signs<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
positive when they're different signs I

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.660 
positive when they're different signs I
always<00:02:33.760> subtract<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.079> 14<00:02:35.769> minus<00:02:36.010> 6<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.400> 8

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
always subtract them so 14 minus 6 is 8

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.699 
always subtract them so 14 minus 6 is 8
and<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.420> sign<00:02:37.720> comes<00:02:38.140> from<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.470> bigger

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and the sign comes from the bigger

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.000 
and the sign comes from the bigger
absolute<00:02:39.340> value<00:02:40.379> right<00:02:41.379> so<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.680> makes<00:02:41.859> sense

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
absolute value right so it makes sense

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.369 
absolute value right so it makes sense
if<00:02:42.159> I<00:02:42.250> owed<00:02:42.519> somebody<00:02:42.819> 14<00:02:43.480> peanuts<00:02:44.019> and

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
if I owed somebody 14 peanuts and

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.069 
if I owed somebody 14 peanuts and
somebody<00:02:44.980> gave<00:02:45.310> me<00:02:45.639> 6<00:02:45.940> more<00:02:46.209> I'm<00:02:46.569> still<00:02:46.959> going

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
somebody gave me 6 more I'm still going

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.479 
somebody gave me 6 more I'm still going
to<00:02:47.139> owe<00:02:47.290> somebody<00:02:47.590> some<00:02:47.950> peanuts<00:02:48.250> I'm<00:02:48.340> gonna

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
to owe somebody some peanuts I'm gonna

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.039 
to owe somebody some peanuts I'm gonna
owe<00:02:48.519> somebody<00:02:48.849> ate<00:02:49.150> peanuts<00:02:51.629> negative<00:02:52.629> 14

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
owe somebody ate peanuts negative 14

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.690 
owe somebody ate peanuts negative 14
plus<00:02:54.540> negative<00:02:55.540> 6<00:02:56.079> negative<00:02:56.349> plus<00:02:57.099> negative

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
plus negative 6 negative plus negative

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.449 
plus negative 6 negative plus negative
is<00:02:58.120> always<00:02:58.540> gonna<00:02:58.659> give<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.049> negative<00:02:59.430> 14<00:03:00.430> plus

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
is always gonna give me negative 14 plus

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.429 
is always gonna give me negative 14 plus
6<00:03:00.939> is<00:03:01.090> gonna<00:03:01.239> be<00:03:01.389> 20<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:01.989> when<00:03:02.139> they're<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
6 is gonna be 20 so when they're the

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.080 
6 is gonna be 20 so when they're the
same<00:03:02.680> sign<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.040> always<00:03:03.459> add<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.970> absolute

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
same sign I always add the absolute

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.569 
same sign I always add the absolute
values<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.019> take<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.409> sign<00:03:05.650> because<00:03:06.459> it

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
values and I take the sign because it

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.339 
values and I take the sign because it
always<00:03:06.970> keeps<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> sign<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.959> what<00:03:08.139> I<00:03:08.170> was

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
always keeps the sign of what I was

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.980 
always keeps the sign of what I was
adding<00:03:08.799> there
