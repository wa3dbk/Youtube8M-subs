to<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.090> over<00:00:18.359> what's<00:00:18.539> onboard<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
to be going over what's onboard what you

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.720 
to be going over what's onboard what you
can<00:00:19.439> expect<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.039> software<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
can expect from the software and a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.279 
can expect from the software and a
little<00:00:21.330> later<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.539> you'll<00:00:21.810> hear<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.140> audio

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
actually a very musical noise gate and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
actually a very musical noise gate and
you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.099> tweak<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> accent<00:00:32.969> tight<00:00:33.210> palm

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you can tweak it to accent tight palm

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can tweak it to accent tight palm
