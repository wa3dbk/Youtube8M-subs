00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.420
 we have 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.190
 a tonomac television 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.460
 the slim version the last 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.630
 in soria gordon of bad for being two 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.780
 the flaw it has is we light 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.930
 and then turn on has the high 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.170
 has high tension all but 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.790
 has a horizontal line that is the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 vertical closed 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.250
 and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.730
 I think it is not covered but I think 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.930
 that the possible we are going to pay because the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.840
 possible failures may be what 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 and 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.480
 there may be trainers and welds 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.110
 cold or broken in the stage of the integral 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 vertical 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.199
 and well if you can not also be 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.649
 interrogative 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.079
 now let's escape to what I could 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.659
 find is that in one of the legs of the 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.460
 flashback on leg number 3 does not 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 he can see well with the camera but I 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.549
 I'm going to tell you that there is welding 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.759
 as a game and does not make contact and that 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.490
 the leg of the power outlet 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.829
 of the vertical stage or the 24 goal 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.380
 then that retouch the weld well and 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.159
 good and check to see if you are still 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.549
 the track are going to get free and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.550
 let's get there let's get here is the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.590
 vertical stage feeding 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.710
 then it is likely that the faults will 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.650
 have been for that reason 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.770
 Now let's solder and 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.030
 let's prove that the step we remember 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 those that are doubtful 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.719
 and we are going to corroborate what 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.879
 between that now unfold the vertical 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.879
 and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.010
 harder only 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.319
 at the same time 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 we weld and it is very likely that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.489
 There is also a need to change some capacitor 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.420
 electrolytic but well we're going to 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.220
 corroborate after 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.220
 Let's solve at a good temperature 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.459
 and now let's try 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.709
 we plug in 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 talking 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.300
 to a speaker 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.500
 let's put the desired date and all 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.500
 those issues 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.440
 it's magnificent, do not plug it in 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.440
 come on the 220 cable 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.599
 Y 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.170
 let's console 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.330
 but no 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.330
 let's corroborate 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.790
 we are not 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.590
 we have 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.220
 they take a little bit in these TVs 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.220
 in normal 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.730
 and it is already 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.700
 this solution was a cold solder in 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.340
 the power output leg 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.720
 of the flashback that feeds the stage 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.480
 vertical 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.340
 those lines that you see is not a 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.230
 today's Spanish on the television no 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.390
 they emit and not vice versa but the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.870
 frequency of the vertical interfered with 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.630
 the affirmation with that of the camera but 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.110
 there is working perfect the 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.110
 crossbar
