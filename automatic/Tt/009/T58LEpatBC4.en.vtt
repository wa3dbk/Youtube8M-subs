00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
this is kind of a tricky part because

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and it's kind of hard for me to make it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.090 
and it's kind of hard for me to make it
cuter<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.760> just<00:02:41.240> go<00:02:41.480> ahead<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.870> do<00:02:42.860> what

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
cuter so I just go ahead and do what

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.910 
cuter so I just go ahead and do what
what<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.060> original<00:02:44.180> character<00:02:45.050> has

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920

back here just do some sort of random
kind<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.959> shape<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:09.209> there<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.790> part

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
kind of shape here there now this part

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.069 
kind of shape here there now this part
is<00:03:13.150> finished<00:03:13.709> here<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:18.510> moving<00:03:19.510> on<00:03:19.690> to
