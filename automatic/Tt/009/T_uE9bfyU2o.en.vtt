 The question yesterday has Julian Draxler 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.289
 expressed himself that he loved to the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.670
 saturday in sc freiburg his comeback 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.560
 This could be celebrated from his point of view 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.859
 today we of course that the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.230
 july felt that way and is natural 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.160
 an ambitious player with the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 wants to play football 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.930
 We have it now this week 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.860
 Team training and everything 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.050
 I also talked to the boy 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 We said we looked 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.870
 see if the week goes like this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.390
 with him and we will make a decision 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.640
 meet after the final training 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 morning 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.000
 whether he is there or not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.159
 this weekend okay then i hand over 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.030
 ask your questions to robert how 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.030
 matteo and horst heldt 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.970
 sebastian high-purity dimaggio how far 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.570
 is jefferson proceedings it is already one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 Candidate for the startelf 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 I think that has played 540 minutes 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 have certainly done well 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.580
 get a little rhythm of play there 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.670
 And I'm allowed to play a player 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.549
 need to analyze the financial statements workout 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.490
 and see if he is willing to 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.229
 time and also the conditions around 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:55.709
 to get started 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:57.060
 for saturday straw di di matteo 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.380
 toilet has shoot the gates 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 not worked so well 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.929
 the striker hit not why is 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.649
 what are you doing against it 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.539
 This attitude we have to do 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.690
 of course many final training as well 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.989
 to improve the in training 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.690
 but I think it's about the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.010
 attitude of the whole team 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.190
 and not just the strikers we have to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.440
 stop the team doing more and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.260
 the strikers are more supportive of them 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.329
 get him into better situations and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.950
 more chances for the 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.810
 Striker so that it again 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.630
 but I think it's important too 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.840
 shoot that other players gates 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.900
 that we do not care too much for one 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.720
 Focus on player for two players 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.720
 otherwise ten years too predictable 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.349
 Sebastian Hochheimer and Joerg 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 strawshine then the big hit 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.500
 because of the many injured they were 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.780
 In the past often forced 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
 to improvise now is so slow 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.580
 almost everyone is back and it seems so 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.709
 also to be like that on her 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.970
 Message Favorite 4 can change 3 3 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.900
 as now is the time where she finally 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.730
 can enforce their plan 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.569
 I think this time has shown us 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.590
 that we with this team in two 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.180
 or play different systems 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.540
 and it always depends on the availability 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.970
 the player is driving there now 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.709
 with the players the ecircle 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.190
 commission we have different 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.980
 options and variants too and that gives 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.500
 us the possibility maybe as well 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.579
 in the second half against Augsburg 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 With 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.950
 to play with the 4 2 3 1 and here 33 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.019
 depending on how the game is played 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.209
 It was easy for us to proceed 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.889
 to talk about endgame but believe it 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.419
 that now that I'm her very last one 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.859
 Maybe it could be a chance 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.319
 still to get started or have 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.549
 the hope gave up 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.340
 It is important for us that we are simple 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.680
 Take games for example and try 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.979
 winning the game is for us 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.250
 of course, on saturday is three points 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.070
 very very important, everything else is useful 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.810
 probably not us and it 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.880
 we must we think can not 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.470
 the games after he think we have to 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.979
 focus on this game for 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.320
 Saturday and at home try one 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.550
 to win and who knows and then 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.550
 Let's see what happens 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.630
 Roberto is better at the opponents 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.810
 estimate the sc freiburg what 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.690
 do you expect on Saturday you sc 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.840
 Of course, freiburg is a team 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.380
 which allows very little space 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.020
 they stand with practically all players 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.090
 behind the ball 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.110
 with two fourth and two strikers the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.940
 make good pressing too and then be 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.030
 good counterplayer 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.790
 I think it 's important for us 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.030
 try to clear the right place 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.610
 play and try the opponent too 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.760
 move so we create space 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.760
 You can then play out chances
