fiendish chain I have been going back

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.779 
fiendish chain I have been going back
and<00:04:42.740> forth<00:04:42.889> between<00:04:43.130> this<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.430> break<00:04:43.639> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
skill right now I'm liking chained for

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.379 
skill right now I'm liking chained for
its<00:04:45.770> ability<00:04:45.919> to<00:04:46.100> not<00:04:46.280> only<00:04:46.310> stop<00:04:46.970> monster

effects but to also stop attacks that's
the<00:04:50.360> important<00:04:50.840> one<00:04:51.020> fiendish<00:04:51.680> chain<00:04:51.710> can

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
the important one fiendish chain can

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.310 
the important one fiendish chain can
stop<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.000> big<00:04:53.150> monster<00:04:53.509> from<00:04:53.660> coming<00:04:54.020> at<00:04:54.169> you
