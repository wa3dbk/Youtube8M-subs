00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 about verdasco ins online 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.000
 Today I can take a closer look 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.080
 on the spell because of the on the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.009
 animals was introduced on craig 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.599
 you have not always been 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.640
 Wanted your own magic too 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 simply create even a firework to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.369
 take and india a frost fire lightning 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.869
 to transform 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 if the answer to one of the two 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.099
 ask yes should be then it is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.599
 new feature of elder scrolls online 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.670
 just right for you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.009
 the man is crafting or too german 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.989
 magic is about existing ones 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.160
 to take glamor and expand it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.200
 and to improve 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 but that will be a mix 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.820
 Explore from locks to explore Morph 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.450
 and crafting and that out 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.460
 good reason 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.739
 First you do not have to fit once 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.110
 the corresponding recipes can be found in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.520
 case of vw are the blackboards the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 are scattered all over the world 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 sometimes intact but sometimes too 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 splintered and so you do not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 completely disoriented by the wearer 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 You must be able to guild at the magician 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 learn a nice little addiction magic 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.170
 but probably only if you the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 quest already complete all 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.920
 have created by this new magic 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.070
 the one magic ball that you guys to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 performs magical passages or tours 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 if you go through it you will find it there 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.740
 a stone plate now applies in a way 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.720
 mini game to wash the plates and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.890
 the enchanter engraved on it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.020
 add to collection 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.939
 then you can change that spell 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.220
 So basically morph and bring him along 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.110
 to equip it with additional effects 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.650
 you have a total of six effects 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 selection 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 around 2 on a permanent cost reduction ritual 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.030
 and surfaces effect this can be 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.040
 Of course, that still change it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.509
 Actually you come into play 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.189
 for example, a skill like 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.320
 lightning and combine it with the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.390
 effect surfaces effect then you get 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 a chain lightning bolt was taken in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.079
 cast a spell and add to it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.939
 duration and then yours 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.820
 summoned creature permanently to yours 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.860
 stay side 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 Do you have the desired effects on the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.300
 spell applied would have the whole thing 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.950
 Engraving in a blackboard has the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.930
 quality of the board also has an influence 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.250
 on the strength of the magic let yourself 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.790
 but not with cheap stone board 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.800
 fobbed 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.200
 only after the engraving on a magic 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.850
 the new spell is ready 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 if you want you can do it now 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.270
 consume and thus add to yours 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.640
 magic book in train and can you now 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.440
 use normal ability or he 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.209
 ask the blackboard in the auction house or in the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.770
 trade channel on for a strong 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.480
 magic you get the one or 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.790
 thrown another gold coin afterwards 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.980
 but there is a small problem 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.020
 still are screenshots from 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.650
 magic wm to see and already one 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 Video 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.220
 but when it actually comes into play 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.930
 is still coming in the stars 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.940
 First of all, developers still have to 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.410
 extensively test how much the new ones 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.030
 magic on the balance of the classes 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.459
 because we are honest 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.050
 Magic sounds pretty cool 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.880
 but if it's the whole class balloons 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.130
 that's all over the pile 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.480
 other than good for the game but there 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.100
 Let's just rely on them 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.050
 developers will already know what 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.790
 they're doing while thanks for 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.790
 watch and see you next time
