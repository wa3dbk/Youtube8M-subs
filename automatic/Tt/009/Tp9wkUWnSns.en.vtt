various sized boxes to try to pick so
anyway<00:00:03.419> regardless<00:00:04.730> you're<00:00:05.730> picking<00:00:06.089> it

upside<00:00:06.540> down<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.259> pins<00:00:07.620> are<00:00:07.859> all<00:00:07.980> facing

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
upside down so the pins are all facing

upside down so the pins are all facing
this<00:00:08.610> way<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.530> you're<00:00:10.530> pushing<00:00:10.800> down<00:00:10.980> and

this way and you're pushing down and
some<00:00:12.389> people<00:00:12.599> might<00:00:12.719> say<00:00:12.780> why<00:00:13.049> don't<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.259> just

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
some people might say why don't you just

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.320 
some people might say why don't you just
turn<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.620> upside<00:00:13.980> down<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.519> don't<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.150> for

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
turn it upside down I don't know for

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
turn it upside down I don't know for
those<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.690> who<00:00:15.839> think<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.199> may<00:00:16.500> ever<00:00:16.650> want

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
those of you who think you may ever want

those of you who think you may ever want
to<00:00:17.039> open<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> lock<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.789> real<00:00:17.970> life<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
to open a lock in real life as a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.210 
to open a lock in real life as a
locksmith<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.619> know<00:00:19.740> say<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> lock

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
locksmith or you know say you lock

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
locksmith or you know say you lock
yourself<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:20.820> something<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.359> lose<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> key

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
yourself out or something you lose a key

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
yourself out or something you lose a key
more<00:00:22.650> than<00:00:22.800> likely<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.490> gonna<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.760> hanging

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
more than likely it's gonna be hanging

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
more than likely it's gonna be hanging
right-side<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.650> used

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
right-side up so why not just get used

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.900 
right-side up so why not just get used
to<00:00:25.949> picking<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> right-side<00:00:27.029> up<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> notice

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to picking it right-side up so notice

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.939 
to picking it right-side up so notice
there's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> pretty<00:00:30.810> fair<00:00:31.050> range<00:00:31.410> throughout

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
there's a pretty fair range throughout

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.900 
there's a pretty fair range throughout
which<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.640> apply<00:00:32.730> attention<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:34.910> there's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
which I can apply attention here there's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
which I can apply attention here there's
a<00:00:36.000> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> movement<00:00:36.780> there<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.380> you'll<00:00:38.280> find

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
a lot of movement there and you'll find

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.970 
a lot of movement there and you'll find
that<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.260> all<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.649> at

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that you don't have to be all the way at

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.520 
that you don't have to be all the way at
the<00:00:41.190> farthest<00:00:42.030> end<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.629> range<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.110> motion

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the farthest end of that range of motion

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.779 
the farthest end of that range of motion
to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:44.399> applying<00:00:44.760> tension<00:00:46.399> also<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.460> think

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to be applying tension also I think

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.020 
to be applying tension also I think
there<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.329> security<00:00:49.200> pins<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
there are some security pins in this not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.260 
there are some security pins in this not
positive<00:00:51.660> about<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:56.550> back<00:00:56.789> pin<00:00:57.120> on

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
positive about that and the back pin on

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.840 
positive about that and the back pin on
this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.960> tough<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> reach<00:01:00.140> see

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.730 

yeah<00:01:07.390> reasonably<00:01:07.930> sure<00:01:08.080> there's<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.470> few

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
yeah reasonably sure there's a few

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.690 
yeah reasonably sure there's a few
spools<00:01:09.190> or<00:01:09.550> something<00:01:10.950> because<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.100> do<00:01:12.160> seem<00:01:12.490> to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
spools or something because I do seem to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.410 
spools or something because I do seem to
occasionally<00:01:13.330> get<00:01:13.570> some<00:01:13.810> false<00:01:14.080> set<00:01:14.470> as<00:01:15.420> on

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
occasionally get some false set as on

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.420 
occasionally get some false set as on
this<00:01:16.630> front<00:01:17.200> pin<00:01:17.440> here<00:01:19.800> okay<00:01:20.800> so<00:01:20.950> there<00:01:21.250> she

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
this front pin here okay so there she

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
this front pin here okay so there she
goes

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
goes

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.510 
goes
now<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.260> was<00:01:23.470> looking<00:01:23.770> at<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.950> lock<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.370> not

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
now I was looking at the lock and not

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.750 
now I was looking at the lock and not
the<00:01:24.640> camera<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.270> don't<00:01:25.450> know<00:01:25.540> if<00:01:25.690> that

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
the camera so I don't know if that

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.830 
the camera so I don't know if that
mm-hmm<00:01:27.790> how<00:01:28.120> that<00:01:28.180> came<00:01:28.540> out

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
mm-hmm how that came out

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.690 
mm-hmm how that came out
but<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.620> thing<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.860> wanted<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.130> say<00:01:30.340> and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
but the thing I wanted to say and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.840 
but the thing I wanted to say and
hopefully<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.360> saw<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.720> as<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:31.990> was<00:01:32.760> opening<00:01:33.760> up

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
hopefully you saw it as I was opening up

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.300 
hopefully you saw it as I was opening up
the<00:01:34.030> lock<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.460> don't<00:01:36.729> have<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:38.310> again

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the lock is that you don't have to again

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.520 
the lock is that you don't have to again
don't<00:01:39.790> have<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.090> apply<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.450> full<00:01:40.840> range<00:01:41.170> of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
don't have to apply the full range of

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.249 
don't have to apply the full range of
tension<00:01:42.040> as<00:01:42.970> long<00:01:43.119> as<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.300> have<00:01:43.479> some<00:01:43.780> tension

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
tension as long as you have some tension

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.350 
tension as long as you have some tension
on<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.130> some<00:01:45.430> room<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.000> wriggle

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
on it it can have some room to wriggle

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.700 
on it it can have some room to wriggle
yet<00:01:46.570> before<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:48.460> as<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.759> said<00:01:49.000> once<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
yet before because as I said once the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.350 
yet before because as I said once the
key<00:01:50.710> engages<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.960> shackle<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.610> can<00:01:54.940> be<00:01:55.060> quite

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
key engages the shackle it can be quite

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.499 
key engages the shackle it can be quite
hard<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.660> move<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.880> mean<00:01:57.880> by<00:01:58.060> quite<00:01:58.300> hard

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
hard to move I mean by quite hard

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.150 
hard to move I mean by quite hard
obviously<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.710> relative

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
obviously that it's a relative

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.670 
obviously that it's a relative
expression<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.630> requires<00:02:01.990> several

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
expression and that requires several

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.380 
expression and that requires several
pounds<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.220> force<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.060> than<00:02:07.240> it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
pounds of force but more so than it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.910 
pounds of force but more so than it
would<00:02:07.509> be<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.080> put<00:02:08.110> enough<00:02:08.410> tension<00:02:08.619> on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
would be just to put enough tension on

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:20.870 
would be just to put enough tension on
this<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.720> let's<00:02:11.290> see<00:02:13.440> there's<00:02:14.440> another<00:02:14.640> spool

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.750 

and<00:02:21.880> my<00:02:22.120> brother<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.810> walked<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.320> door

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
