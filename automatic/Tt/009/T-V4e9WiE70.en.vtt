at<00:00:29.779> all<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.859> cable<00:00:31.780> will<00:00:32.860> talk<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.040> in<00:00:34.070> a

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
at all the cable will talk to you in a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.200 
at all the cable will talk to you in a
bit<00:00:34.339> more<00:00:36.129> if<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:37.250> sort<00:00:37.519> of<00:00:37.579> bend<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:37.940> like<00:00:37.970> that

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
bit more if I sort of bend it like that

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.119 
bit more if I sort of bend it like that
but<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.540> does<00:00:38.750> tend<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.079> pull<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.440> camera<00:00:39.829> over

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129

but it does tend to pull the camera over
slowly<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:41.199> think<00:00:42.199> I'm<00:00:42.320> just<00:00:42.350> turn<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.769> camera

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
tight because they're going down into

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.419 
tight because they're going down into
some<00:02:05.580> polystyrene<00:02:06.229> ain't<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> developer

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
some polystyrene ain't see the developer

the backing is non sticky type I just

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.300 
the backing is non sticky type I just
had<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> trim<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.330> bit<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:14.130> allow

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
had to trim a little bit here to allow

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.330 
had to trim a little bit here to allow
it<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> sit<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> bit<00:02:14.790> flatter<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.800> pins<00:02:17.040> go

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it to sit a bit flatter and the pins go

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.720 
it to sit a bit flatter and the pins go
that<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.739> polystyrene<00:02:19.739> foam<00:02:19.770> which

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that way into polystyrene foam which

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.910 
that way into polystyrene foam which
lines<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> helmet<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.260> surprising<00:02:22.739> how

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
lines the helmet and it's surprising how

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.130 
lines the helmet and it's surprising how
tight<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.459> are<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> front<00:02:27.090> tent<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.870> held

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
tight they are so the front tent is held

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.350 
tight they are so the front tent is held
by<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> staple<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.400> rear<00:02:29.580> edge<00:02:29.760> helped<00:02:30.120> by

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
by the staple the rear edge helped by

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.490 
by the staple the rear edge helped by
the<00:02:30.420> glass<00:02:30.750> pins<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:32.630> hear<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.870> just<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.350> power

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
the glass pins I hear is just a power

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.820 
the glass pins I hear is just a power
cable<00:02:34.799> with<00:02:35.209> against<00:02:36.209> April<00:02:36.540> velcro<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.500> that

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
cable with against April velcro and that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.370 
cable with against April velcro and that
just<00:02:38.040> holds<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.640> above<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.660> eyesight<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
just holds that up above my eyesight I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.520 
just holds that up above my eyesight I
line<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:42.360> plugs<00:02:42.720> into<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> side<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
line and that plugs into the side of the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.650 
line and that plugs into the side of the
camera<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:45.570> cable<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:47.000> tucked<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
camera the cable is just tucked in to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.110 
camera the cable is just tucked in to
the<00:02:48.750> camera<00:02:49.080> like<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.880> ok

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
the camera like that ok

the camera like that ok
and<00:02:53.819> one<00:02:54.819> thing<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:55.120> will<00:02:55.180> say<00:02:55.330> about<00:02:55.690> these

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and one thing I will say about these

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.520 
and one thing I will say about these
power<00:02:56.170> packs<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:58.060> since<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.140> has<00:02:59.230> an<00:02:59.379> on/off

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
some kind of electrical bits in it

resistors<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.000> capacitors<00:03:10.150> maybe<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:13.000> rig<00:03:13.150> it

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
resistors and capacitors maybe to rig it

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.970

charger<00:03:17.640> but<00:03:18.640> I've<00:03:18.760> found<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.180> these<00:03:19.360> USB

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
connections are not very reliable so I'm

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.440 
connections are not very reliable so I'm
thinking<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.590> changing<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.400> USB<00:03:24.849> connections

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
thinking of changing the USB connections

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.839 
thinking of changing the USB connections
here<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:26.560> for<00:03:27.340> something<00:03:27.549> more

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
here and here for something more

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.910 
here and here for something more
reliable<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> power-packed<00:03:32.650> like

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
reliable but with a power-packed like

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.839 
reliable but with a power-packed like
this<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:34.030> can<00:03:34.090> run<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.660> six<00:03:35.650> hours<00:03:35.849> if

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
this it can run up to six hours if

it<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.349> I<00:04:26.470> don't<00:04:26.620> know<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.840> that's<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:29.139> about

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
it is I don't know and that's just about

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.050 
it is I don't know and that's just about
four<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.770> back<00:04:29.919> near<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.400> camera<00:04:30.849> but

belt<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:31.660> side<00:04:31.870> also<00:04:32.050> so<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.070> can<00:04:33.280> use<00:04:33.430> it

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
belt on this side also so I can use it

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.010
