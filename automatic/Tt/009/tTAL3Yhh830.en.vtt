00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the one that idea to this concept was

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.529 
the one that idea to this concept was
that<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.740> i<00:00:28.769> needed<00:00:29.189> use<00:00:29.550> stbb<00:00:30.090> missiles

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that when i needed use stbb missiles

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
that when i needed use stbb missiles
that<00:00:30.689> they<00:00:31.019> tied<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.740> tintin<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> heartened

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that they tied the tintin is heartened

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
that they tied the tintin is heartened
to<00:00:33.450> get<00:00:33.630> them<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.930> lock<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.230> public<00:00:34.620> freeway

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
to get them to lock on public freeway

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.720 
to get them to lock on public freeway
I'm<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.760> gonna<00:00:35.989> okay<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.890> we

have the sale is asteroid I want try the
aiming<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.059> station<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.620> asteroid<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
aiming at a station but this asteroid is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.420 
aiming at a station but this asteroid is
behind<00:00:44.460> us<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.870> ill<00:00:45.870> try<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.590> switch<00:00:47.039> between

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
behind us and ill try to switch between

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
behind us and ill try to switch between
the<00:00:47.760> tooth<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.230> it's<00:00:49.230> something<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the tooth and it's something that is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
the tooth and it's something that is
annoying<00:00:49.890> especially<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.489> moving<00:00:50.820> targets

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
annoying especially with moving targets

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.500 
annoying especially with moving targets
with<00:00:51.360> turrets<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> thought<00:00:53.100> was

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
with turrets so when I thought was

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.500 
with turrets so when I thought was
autodoc<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.750> bunch<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.320> cause<00:00:56.010> around<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.180> core

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
autodoc a bunch of cause around the core

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.619 
autodoc a bunch of cause around the core
room<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.960> your<00:00:58.109> capital<00:00:58.289> ship<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
room of your capital ship so to do this

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.889 
room of your capital ship so to do this
I<00:01:01.129> basically<00:01:02.129> made<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:03.030> called<00:01:03.359> flare

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I basically made something called flare

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.820 
I basically made something called flare
I<00:01:05.270> call<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> flabby<00:01:06.689> case<00:01:06.960> sort<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
I call a flabby case sort of like the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490 
I call a flabby case sort of like the
way<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.189> some<00:01:08.700> modern<00:01:09.360> planes<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:10.140> Flair's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
way that some modern planes use Flair's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.600 
way that some modern planes use Flair's
to<00:01:10.860> deflect<00:01:11.729> missiles<00:01:13.250> plate<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> flare

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to deflect missiles plate a flare

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
to deflect missiles plate a flare
basically<00:01:15.210> took<00:01:15.450> lots<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.229> documents<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.250> dot

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
basically took lots of documents and dot

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.420 
basically took lots of documents and dot
lots<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.939> ship<00:01:18.180> calls<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
lots of ship calls to them and then I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
lots of ship calls to them and then I
thought<00:01:20.670> let's<00:01:21.090> take<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.080> make

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
thought let's take this and put on make

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.740 
thought let's take this and put on make
a<00:01:22.590> cube<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> quarter<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> ship<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.390> then

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a cube as a quarter of the ship and then

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
a cube as a quarter of the ship and then
put<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.110> each<00:01:25.290> side<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.759> was

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
put this on each side and then this was

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.130 
put this on each side and then this was
the<00:01:27.360> result<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.900> she<00:01:30.900> calls

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the result so you have these she calls

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.550 
the result so you have these she calls
all<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:31.979> core<00:01:32.159> room<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.320> already

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
all over your core room and if already

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.749 
all over your core room and if already
thinking<00:01:34.799> yeah<00:01:35.250> well<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thinking yeah well there's a lot of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.050 
thinking yeah well there's a lot of
space<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.299> look<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> corners<00:01:37.439> that

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
space if we look in the corners that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.100 
space if we look in the corners that
nothing<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.150> happen<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:39.869> log<00:01:39.990> on

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
nothing will happen you can still log on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.600 
nothing will happen you can still log on
to<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> core<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:40.740> looking<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to the core like I'm looking now but

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
to the core like I'm looking now but
imagine<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> real<00:01:42.659> big<00:01:42.810> capital

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
imagine if you got a real big capital

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
imagine if you got a real big capital
ship<00:01:43.380> you'll<00:01:43.860> probably<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> able<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> get

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
ship you'll probably not be able to get

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
ship you'll probably not be able to get
this<00:01:45.299> close<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> call<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> guys

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this close to the call so if you guys

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
this close to the call so if you guys
got<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.430> look<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.210> tightly<00:01:48.899> packed<00:01:49.259> these

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
got out look how tightly packed these

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.280 
got out look how tightly packed these
nodes<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.149> impossible<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> learn<00:01:51.659> log<00:01:51.990> on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
nodes are is impossible to learn log on

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.660 
nodes are is impossible to learn log on
to<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.850> without<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.149> moving<00:01:55.009> look<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.520> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to one without a moving look it's just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
to one without a moving look it's just
impossible<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.540> can't<00:01:57.719> even<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> ship

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
impossible you can't even see the ship

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.899 
impossible you can't even see the ship
call<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.740> filter<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.670> it'll

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
call you could go filter out but it'll

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.700 
call you could go filter out but it'll
still<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.299> impossible<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> without

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
still be impossible to have it without

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
still be impossible to have it without
looking<00:02:05.130> onto<00:02:05.460> something<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.329> basically<00:02:06.600> now

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
looking onto something so basically now
