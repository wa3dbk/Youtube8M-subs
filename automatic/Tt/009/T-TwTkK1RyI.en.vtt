hi everyone this is aaron for xolo tech
and<00:00:08.010> we're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.550> comparing<00:00:09.030> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
and we're going to be comparing the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.570 
and we're going to be comparing the
youtube<00:00:09.570> applications<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.410> both<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.889> ipad<00:00:11.309> 2

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
youtube applications on both the ipad 2

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.150 
youtube applications on both the ipad 2
and<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.269> motorola<00:00:12.690> xoom<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.259> few<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.099> have

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and the motorola xoom a few of you have

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.640 
and the motorola xoom a few of you have
asked<00:00:14.519> me<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> compare<00:00:15.030> html5<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.320> figured

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
asked me to compare html5 and I figured

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
asked me to compare html5 and I figured
the<00:00:16.740> best<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.670> using

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the best way to do that would be using

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.500 
the best way to do that would be using
YouTube<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.439> uses<00:00:19.680> html5<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.850> not

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
YouTube because it uses html5 and not

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.050 
YouTube because it uses html5 and not
flash<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.199> both<00:00:22.500> devices<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.550> let's<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:24.029> ahead

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
flash on both devices so let's go ahead

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.790 
flash on both devices so let's go ahead
and<00:00:24.330> open<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and open them up in here it's and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.859 
and open them up in here it's and
applications<00:00:26.400> I've<00:00:26.910> already<00:00:27.119> searched<00:00:27.510> for

the pause lows on the zoom it loaded a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
the pause lows on the zoom it loaded a
lot<00:01:37.380> faster<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.610> notice

the side then you can tap on these play

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
the side then you can tap on these play

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
play we can do full screen on this too
and<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> reason<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.720> oriented

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and the reason I have these oriented

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499 
and the reason I have these oriented
this<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.490> zoom<00:01:53.670> likes<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.149> held<00:01:54.329> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this way is the zoom likes to be held in

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
this way is the zoom likes to be held in
landscape<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
landscape you can kind of see the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.260 
landscape you can kind of see the
wording<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> home<00:01:56.729> buttons<00:01:57.060> are

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
wording and where the home buttons are

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
wording and where the home buttons are
it<00:01:57.630> looks<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.649> landscape<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.460> the

back<00:03:06.540> let's<00:03:08.420> try<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.720> more<00:03:09.780> time<00:03:09.989> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
back let's try it one more time and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.120 
back let's try it one more time and
let's<00:03:12.510> see<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:12.780> we<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:13.110> find<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:15.890> wherever<00:03:16.890> it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
let's see if we can find the wherever it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.610 
let's see if we can find the wherever it
is<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.610> ipad<00:03:18.120> 2<00:03:18.450> unboxing<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.140> sorted<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
is the ipad 2 unboxing this is sorted a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.990 
is the ipad 2 unboxing this is sorted a
little<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:25.950> differently<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.489> can<00:03:26.610> see<00:03:26.820> i

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
little bit differently as you can see i

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460 
little bit differently as you can see i
guess<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:27.570> don't<00:03:27.690> need<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.140> i<00:03:28.200> probably

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
guess we don't need to and i probably

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.080 
guess we don't need to and i probably
have<00:03:28.769> missed<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.489> guys<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.820> already

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
have missed it and you guys have already

have missed it and you guys have already
seen<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.530> let's<00:03:31.530> find<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:33.000> screen

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
seen it but let's find the screen

seen it but let's find the screen
compared<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.500> here's<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.890> similar<00:03:35.220> video

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
compared so here's the similar video

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.060 
compared so here's the similar video
let's<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:35.880> ahead<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.260> tap<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.410> those<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.920> see

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
let's go ahead and tap on those and see

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.199 
let's go ahead and tap on those and see
what<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.040> let's<00:03:44.519> see<00:03:44.730> what<00:03:44.760> happens

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
what we get so let's see what happens

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.780 
what we get so let's see what happens
here<00:03:45.420> still<00:03:46.230> loading<00:03:46.620> both<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:47.010> them<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:50.400> ipad

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
here still loading both of them the ipad

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.479 
here still loading both of them the ipad
you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> see<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.390> status<00:03:51.690> bar<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:53.100> now

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
you can see the status bar and now

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.880 
you can see the status bar and now
they're<00:03:53.700> identical<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.959> i<00:03:54.989> think<00:03:55.170> there's

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
they're identical so i think there's

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.190 
they're identical so i think there's
really<00:03:56.190> not<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.519> huge<00:03:57.090> difference<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.720> how<00:03:57.870> fast

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
really not a huge difference in how fast

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.560 
really not a huge difference in how fast
they<00:03:58.410> play<00:03:58.590> video<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:59.100> mean<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.850> really<00:04:00.060> depends

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
they play video I mean it really depends

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.020 
they play video I mean it really depends
on<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> video<00:04:01.080> you're<00:04:01.260> playing<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.670> so

on the video you're playing and it's so

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.270 
on the video you're playing and it's so
close<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:04.049> hard<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.350> call<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.100> guys

call it and let me know what you think
that's<00:04:07.320> really<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.799> as<00:04:07.980> far<00:04:08.190> as<00:04:08.310> that

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
that's really it as far as that

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.800 
that's really it as far as that
