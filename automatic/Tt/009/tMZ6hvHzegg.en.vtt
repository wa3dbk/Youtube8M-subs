00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
phrase nice and slow so it's obviously

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.740

the<00:00:56.980> same<00:00:57.160> phrase<00:00:57.460> essentially<00:00:58.120> played<00:00:58.390> twice

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
the same phrase essentially played twice

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.750

other stuff

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.079 
other stuff
so<00:01:02.469> let's<00:01:02.710> real<00:01:03.219> quickly<00:01:03.489> just<00:01:03.610> break<00:01:04.059> down

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
so let's real quickly just break down

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.899 
so let's real quickly just break down
beat<00:01:04.689> by<00:01:04.839> beat<00:01:04.869> what<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.409> is<00:01:05.560> simple<00:01:05.950> simple

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
beat by beat what that is simple simple

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.969 
beat by beat what that is simple simple
intro<00:01:07.509> which<00:01:07.719> is<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.109> stick<00:01:08.319> on<00:01:08.469> stick<00:01:08.740> and

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
intro which is just stick on stick and

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.699 
intro which is just stick on stick and
then<00:01:09.069> a<00:01:09.100> bass<00:01:09.280> drum<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.630> then<00:01:11.499> we're<00:01:11.619> gonna

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:11.709 
then a bass drum and then we're gonna

then a bass drum and then we're gonna
play<00:01:11.889> a<00:01:11.920> triplet<00:01:12.459> right<00:01:12.789> left<00:01:13.209> right<00:01:13.420> but<00:01:14.049> it's

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
play a triplet right left right but it's

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.389 
play a triplet right left right but it's
gonna<00:01:14.259> be<00:01:14.380> floor<00:01:14.859> rat<00:01:15.340> floor<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:20.859> beat<00:01:21.100> 3

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
gonna be floor rat floor so the beat 3

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.510 
gonna be floor rat floor so the beat 3
is<00:01:21.490> gonna<00:01:21.639> start<00:01:21.909> on<00:01:22.029> the<00:01:22.119> bass<00:01:22.329> drum<00:01:23.520> also

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.649 
gonna be a triplet so our baseman plays
the<00:01:27.069> downbeat<00:01:27.459> and<00:01:27.639> then<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.209> last<00:01:28.389> two

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
the downbeat and then the last two

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.919 
the downbeat and then the last two
triplets<00:01:29.139> get<00:01:29.560> filled<00:01:29.859> in<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:31.090> not<00:01:31.569> quite

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
triplets get filled in with not quite

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.569 
triplets get filled in with not quite
ghost<00:01:32.200> notes<00:01:32.469> but<00:01:32.619> but<00:01:32.979> definitely<00:01:33.459> a<00:01:33.490> little

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
ghost notes but but definitely a little

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.459 
ghost notes but but definitely a little
softer<00:01:34.329> than<00:01:34.359> what<00:01:34.659> we've<00:01:34.840> been<00:01:34.869> playing<00:01:35.319> in

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
softer than what we've been playing in

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.099 
softer than what we've been playing in
terms<00:01:35.679> of<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:37.029> Tom's<00:01:37.299> right<00:01:37.659> before

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
terms of the the the Tom's right before

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.779 
terms of the the the Tom's right before
it<00:01:38.229> we're<00:01:38.619> gonna<00:01:38.740> fill<00:01:39.069> out<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.399> rest<00:01:39.609> of<00:01:39.729> that

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
it we're gonna fill out the rest of that

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.319 
it we're gonna fill out the rest of that
with<00:01:40.119> two<00:01:40.329> triplets<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:42.340> our<00:01:42.459> left<00:01:42.729> hand<00:01:43.029> and

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
with two triplets in our left hand and

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.879 
with two triplets in our left hand and
then<00:01:43.569> we're<00:01:43.689> gonna<00:01:43.779> close<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.349> back<00:01:44.499> out<00:01:44.709> with

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
then we're gonna close it back out with

00:01:44.889 --> 00:02:25.559 
then we're gonna close it back out with
a<00:01:44.920> stick<00:01:45.219> on<00:01:45.399> stick<00:01:45.700> so

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.869 

it's<00:02:26.569> faster<00:02:27.110> what<00:02:27.799> I<00:02:27.829> found<00:02:28.189> is<00:02:28.430> as<00:02:28.579> it<00:02:28.700> gets

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
it's faster what I found is as it gets

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.220 
it's faster what I found is as it gets
faster<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.329> need<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.689> little<00:02:29.930> bit<00:02:30.079> more

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
faster I need to be a little bit more

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.190 
faster I need to be a little bit more
articulate<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.220> my<00:02:31.430> Tom's<00:02:31.760> otherwise<00:02:32.269> they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
articulate with my Tom's otherwise they

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.410 
articulate with my Tom's otherwise they
kind<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.500> get<00:02:33.680> between<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.579> floor<00:02:34.849> Tom<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
kind of get between the floor Tom the

kind of get between the floor Tom the
rack<00:02:35.599> Tom<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.110> bass<00:02:36.260> drum<00:02:36.290> they<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.769> get

rack Tom and the bass drum they can get
muddy<00:02:37.220> real<00:02:37.549> quick<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.629> I<00:02:38.780> increase<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
muddy real quick so as I increase the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.319 
muddy real quick so as I increase the
tempo<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.890> want<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.400> real<00:02:40.640> careful<00:02:40.939> to<00:02:41.120> hit

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
tempo I want to be real careful to hit

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.030 
tempo I want to be real careful to hit
the<00:02:41.420> drums<00:02:41.689> right<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.170> center<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.709> be

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
the drums right in the center and be

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.339 
the drums right in the center and be
real<00:02:43.340> articulate<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.299> they<00:02:44.420> speak<00:02:44.780> clearly

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
real articulate so they speak clearly

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.649 
real articulate so they speak clearly
and<00:02:45.560> they<00:02:45.620> speak<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:47.180> as<00:02:47.359> they're<00:02:47.510> supposed

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
and they speak just as they're supposed

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.380 
and they speak just as they're supposed
to<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.049> we<00:02:48.530> don't<00:02:48.650> let<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.819> those<00:02:50.090> go

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
to and we don't let that that those go

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.569 
to and we don't let that that those go
stoats<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.840> snare<00:02:51.079> drum<00:02:51.140> start<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.340> cover

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
stoats and a snare drum start to cover

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.550 
stoats and a snare drum start to cover
up<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.569> pitches<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.129> toms<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.440> that's<00:02:57.440> a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560

to<00:03:14.090> learn<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.420> hear<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.019> piece<00:03:15.590> of

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
to learn to hear that piece of

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.890 
to learn to hear that piece of

musical<00:03:20.900> context<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.250> could<00:03:22.430> just<00:03:22.579> take<00:03:22.700> if

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
musical context so I could just take if

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.550 
musical context so I could just take if
I<00:03:23.000> just<00:03:23.239> take<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.689> first<00:03:23.959> part<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.500> that

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
I just take the first part of that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710 
I just take the first part of that
phrase<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.250> can<00:03:25.730> create<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> little<00:03:26.180> two<00:03:26.450> bar

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
phrase I can create a little two bar

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.360 
phrase I can create a little two bar
loop<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.319> play<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.680> phrase<00:03:27.949> then<00:03:28.220> play

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
loop and play the phrase then play

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.000 
loop and play the phrase then play
something<00:03:28.730> super<00:03:29.180> simple<00:03:29.599> after<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
something super simple after it the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.720 
something super simple after it the
complexity<00:03:31.699> of<00:03:31.730> what<00:03:31.819> you<00:03:32.120> play<00:03:32.389> after<00:03:33.199> it

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
complexity of what you play after it

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.520 
complexity of what you play after it
doesn't<00:03:34.730> matter<00:03:34.940> all<00:03:35.629> that<00:03:35.690> matters<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.500> that

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
doesn't matter all that matters is that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.920 
doesn't matter all that matters is that
you<00:03:36.739> play<00:03:36.949> something<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.639> you<00:03:38.030> improvise<00:03:38.569> so

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you play something that you improvise so

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.539 
you play something that you improvise so
because<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.739> we're<00:03:40.040> going<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.190> keep<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
because of that we're going to keep the

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.649 
because of that we're going to keep the
idea<00:03:40.879> simple<00:03:41.389> no<00:03:41.870> reason<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.319> complicate<00:03:42.919> it

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
idea simple no reason to complicate it

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.580 
idea simple no reason to complicate it
because<00:03:44.659> that's<00:03:44.870> not<00:03:45.019> really<00:03:45.290> what<00:03:45.440> we're

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
because that's not really what we're

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.839 
because that's not really what we're
working<00:03:45.769> on<00:03:45.980> we're<00:03:46.159> working<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.579> just<00:03:46.730> being

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
working on we're working on just being

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.729 
working on we're working on just being
able<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.090> hear<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.389> phrase<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.049> then<00:03:48.440> allow

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
able to hear the phrase and then allow

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.530 
able to hear the phrase and then allow
ourselves<00:03:48.889> to<00:03:49.250> improvise<00:03:49.730> something<00:03:50.209> after

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
ourselves to improvise something after

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:06.530 
ourselves to improvise something after
so<00:03:51.049> here's<00:03:51.799> a<00:03:51.859> quick<00:03:52.190> little

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.199 

so<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.840> started<00:04:08.410> with<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.860> you<00:04:09.730> know<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.000> main

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
so I started with that you know the main

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.880 
so I started with that you know the main
part<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.660> phrase<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:10.930> then<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.290> notice<00:04:11.500> I

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
part of the phrase and then you notice I

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.530 
part of the phrase and then you notice I
started<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.519> move<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.819> little<00:04:13.060> bit<00:04:13.209> away<00:04:13.330> from

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
started to move a little bit away from

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.449 
started to move a little bit away from
that<00:04:13.900> slightly<00:04:14.260> adjust<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.950> toward<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.340> end

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that slightly adjust it toward the end

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.000 
that slightly adjust it toward the end
if<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:16.329> heard<00:04:16.570> something<00:04:16.989> different<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.829> not

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
if I heard something different that not

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.979 
if I heard something different that not
trust<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.519> feeling<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> piece<00:04:19.840> of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
trust a feeling I have a piece of

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.469 
trust a feeling I have a piece of
vocabulary<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.799> can<00:04:21.040> use<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.090> just

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
vocabulary that I can use it's not just

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.110 
vocabulary that I can use it's not just
I<00:04:22.720> learned<00:04:23.290> this<00:04:23.500> lick<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.889> I<00:04:23.950> can't<00:04:24.190> find<00:04:24.970> a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
I learned this lick and I can't find a

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.909 
I learned this lick and I can't find a
good<00:04:25.150> place<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.720> squeeze<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.260> in<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.710> do<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
good place to squeeze it in you do the

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.980 
good place to squeeze it in you do the
same<00:04:27.070> thing<00:04:27.310> on<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.820> front<00:04:27.970> side<00:04:28.300> as<00:04:28.479> well<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
same thing on the front side as well the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.280 
same thing on the front side as well the
last<00:04:29.590> thing<00:04:29.889> I<00:04:30.010> want<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> address<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.880> as

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
last thing I want to address is as

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.080 
last thing I want to address is as
always<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.770> mean<00:04:33.040> that's<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.310> really<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:34.030> a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
always I mean that's a really it's a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.820 
always I mean that's a really it's a
great<00:04:34.330> rhythm<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> sticking<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.350> great<00:04:35.590> I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
great rhythm and the sticking is great I

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.129 
great rhythm and the sticking is great I
like<00:04:36.550> how<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:36.910> starts<00:04:37.210> low<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.630> goes<00:04:37.750> high<00:04:37.960> on

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
like how it starts low and goes high on

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.930 
like how it starts low and goes high on
the<00:04:38.260> Tom's<00:04:38.500> or<00:04:39.160> usually<00:04:39.430> things<00:04:39.610> starting

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
the Tom's or usually things starting

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.190 
the Tom's or usually things starting
high<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.479> going<00:04:40.840> going<00:04:41.080> low<00:04:41.440> but<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:43.360> then<00:04:44.080> I

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
high and going going low but so then I

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.270 
high and going going low but so then I
want<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> try<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.590> find<00:04:44.740> other<00:04:44.889> little

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
want to try to find other little

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.280 
want to try to find other little
versions<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.120> one<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.600> ones<00:04:46.810> I<00:04:47.080> was

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
versions of it so one of the ones I was

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.560 
versions of it so one of the ones I was
kicking<00:04:47.590> around<00:04:47.710> was<00:04:48.340> moving<00:04:48.760> these<00:04:49.150> these

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
kicking around was moving these these

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.950 
kicking around was moving these these
low<00:04:49.870> drum<00:04:50.350> sounds<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.080> cymbals<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.900> I

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
low drum sounds to the cymbals and so I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.450 
low drum sounds to the cymbals and so I
just<00:04:56.139> moved<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.500> right<00:04:56.680> hand<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.040> left<00:04:57.160> hand

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460

just moved the right hand and left hand
to<00:04:57.639> right<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.030> left<00:04:58.060> cymbals<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.780> then<00:04:59.229> I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
to right and left cymbals and then I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.950 
to right and left cymbals and then I
exchanged<00:05:00.190> my<00:05:00.370> right<00:05:00.910> bass<00:05:01.180> drum<00:05:01.479> foot<00:05:01.720> for

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
exchanged my right bass drum foot for

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:13.260 
exchanged my right bass drum foot for
that<00:05:02.080> for<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.770> hi-hat

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.820 

same<00:05:13.750> rhythm<00:05:13.930> I've<00:05:14.229> already<00:05:14.470> learned<00:05:14.620> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
same rhythm I've already learned the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.020 
same rhythm I've already learned the
rhythm<00:05:15.070> I've<00:05:15.160> already<00:05:15.370> learned<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.639> sticking

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
rhythm I've already learned the sticking

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.300 
rhythm I've already learned the sticking
might<00:05:16.300> as<00:05:16.419> well<00:05:16.510> find<00:05:16.810> other<00:05:17.050> uses<00:05:17.500> for<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.740> so

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
might as well find other uses for it so

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.460 
might as well find other uses for it so
that's<00:05:18.460> like<00:05:18.610> an<00:05:18.760> entirely<00:05:19.470> high-pitched

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
that's like an entirely high-pitched

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.330 
that's like an entirely high-pitched
sound<00:05:20.940> what<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:21.970> found<00:05:22.300> is<00:05:22.600> if<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.710> took<00:05:24.039> the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
sound what I found is if I took the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.629 
sound what I found is if I took the
second<00:05:25.440> foot<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.740> instead<00:05:27.100> of<00:05:27.160> playing<00:05:27.400> them

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639
