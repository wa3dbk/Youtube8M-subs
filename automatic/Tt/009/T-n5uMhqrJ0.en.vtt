00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
coming out of each wire

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.140 
coming out of each wire
now<00:02:27.989> there's<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.739> pack<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:32.150> therefore

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
now there's two in a pack so therefore

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.540 
now there's two in a pack so therefore
what<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> did<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.410> took<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.890> positives<00:02:35.489> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
what I did is I took the positives and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.770 
what I did is I took the positives and
basically<00:02:38.550> wrapped<00:02:38.880> them<00:02:39.090> around<00:02:39.209> each<00:02:39.540> other

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
basically wrapped them around each other

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420 
basically wrapped them around each other
the<00:02:39.989> positives<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.620> right<00:02:40.769> there<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.340> in

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the positives are right there right in

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.949 
the positives are right there right in
front<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.569> little<00:02:42.780> white

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
front you have that that little white

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.580 
front you have that that little white
stripe

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
stripe

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.040 
stripe
I<00:02:43.620> took<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.730> wrapped<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.269> together<00:02:45.569> took

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
I took it wrapped them together took

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.809 
I took it wrapped them together took
both<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.530> positives<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> did<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.549> and

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
both of the positives and did that and

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.729 
both of the positives and did that and
that<00:02:48.390> took<00:02:48.600> both<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.080> negatives<00:02:49.560> and

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that took both of the negatives and

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.610 
that took both of the negatives and
wrapped<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.370> together<00:02:50.930> therefore<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.230> had

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
wrapped them together therefore I had

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.520 
wrapped them together therefore I had
one<00:02:52.980> big<00:02:53.250> positive<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.030> one<00:02:54.299> big<00:02:54.690> negative

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
one big positive and one big negative

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.430 
one big positive and one big negative
easy<00:02:56.519> stuff<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.510> don't<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.840> me<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.260> it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
easy stuff if you don't get me and it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.479 
easy stuff if you don't get me and it's
just<00:02:58.620> it's<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.549> easy<00:02:59.910> really<00:03:00.690> easy

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
just it's it's easy really easy

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.680 
just it's it's easy really easy
positives<00:03:02.489> wrap<00:03:02.760> them<00:03:02.910> together<00:03:03.000> negatives

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
positives wrap them together negatives

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.940 
positives wrap them together negatives
wrap<00:03:03.810> them<00:03:03.959> together<00:03:04.019> that's<00:03:04.470> basically<00:03:04.769> what

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
wrap them together that's basically what

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.830 
wrap them together that's basically what
I<00:03:04.980> did<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.370> nutshell

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
I did in a nutshell

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.080 
I did in a nutshell
okay<00:03:06.840> now<00:03:07.340> positives<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.519> white<00:03:08.760> stripe

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
okay now positives have a white stripe

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.979 
okay now positives have a white stripe
and<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:10.049> me<00:03:10.170> my<00:03:10.860> red<00:03:11.160> wire<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.480> positive

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
and for me my red wire is the positive

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.849 
and for me my red wire is the positive
so<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.220> did<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.299> can<00:03:15.480> see<00:03:15.690> right

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
so what I did is if you can see right

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.430 
so what I did is if you can see right
smack<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.130> middle<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.579> screen

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
smack in the middle of the screen

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.349 
smack in the middle of the screen
sorry<00:03:19.440> there's<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.310> little<00:03:20.579> bit<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.760> copper

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
sorry there's a little bit of copper

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.680 
sorry there's a little bit of copper
wire<00:03:21.630> at<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.709> edge<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> silver<00:03:24.000> prong<00:03:24.329> on

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
wire at the edge of the silver prong on

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.370 
wire at the edge of the silver prong on
the<00:03:25.620> red<00:03:25.920> wire<00:03:26.480> there's<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.570> little<00:03:27.840> hole<00:03:28.140> in

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the red wire there's a little hole in

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.580 
the red wire there's a little hole in
that<00:03:28.500> prong<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.850> what<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.180> did<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.959> shoved<00:03:31.380> up

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that prong so what I did is I shoved up

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
that prong so what I did is I shoved up
the<00:03:31.829> copper<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.940> through<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.660> hole

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
the copper up through that little hole

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
the copper up through that little hole
and<00:03:34.609> closed<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:36.630> pin<00:03:37.100> over<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.519> prong

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
and closed the little pin over the prong

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.560 
and closed the little pin over the prong
and<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:40.530> did<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.890> same<00:03:41.070> for<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.400> black<00:03:41.640> put<00:03:42.480> it

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
and I did the same for the black put it

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.650 
and I did the same for the black put it
up<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.930> little<00:03:43.140> hole<00:03:43.260> or<00:03:43.489> or<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:45.510> can

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
up to that little hole or or you can

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.140 
up to that little hole or or you can
wrap<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.109> around<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.500> prong<00:03:46.880> now<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.000> works

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
wrap it around the prong now it works

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.750 
wrap it around the prong now it works
either<00:03:48.390> ways<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.370> now<00:03:50.370> I'm<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.670> give

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760
