00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.259
 I started with a two-week internship 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.130
 too much preparation on corner 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.380
 and then after two-three years in the same company I spent the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.160
 cqp one all the certificates of professional qualification that allows 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.990
 to break your thing too much 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.970
 the first company that bites hired to work on rope is 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.930

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.250
 it's been a year and a half that I am specialized applied enterprise 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.970
 others to the surprising 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.400
 we worked we started with to find ourselves at the company with the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.570
 colleague binomial then we did the site we prepare the equipment 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.630
 it takes 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.839
 such a type of construction site 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.450
 and installing% markup so that people can 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.050
 often find themselves tending to 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.010
 what we generally realize as works are band masonry 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.610
 basic against saves a lot of time and money 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.670
 we will repair some masonry and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.940
 make an expansion joint 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.410
 polyurethane 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.080
 to prevent infiltration into the wall for power towards astana 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.580
 sometimes flying scaffolds that also allow us to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.940
 not marked on the ground the eyes to keep the sidewalk 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.380
 completely drunk so that runners can work 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.880
 completely safe 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.270
 once the work was done, it ultimately cost 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 site on my site card for but to another 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.730
 on the positive side we 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.430
 the Lille all day we are all alone on his rope is touched 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.150
 at just as much masonry and painting a little bit of coverage one has to 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.040
 manage oneself the yards are organized over two years the sides 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.850
 negatives of the trade when it's cold it prevents us from realizing some 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.620
 work parents will produce unused and summer heatwave the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.730
 left that we will do with to practice well this job is necessary 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.110
 to the fortifying jets of physics not to have vertigo but also to get out

 victim what I like most in the trade changes every day 9 sites 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.050
 intervention that always has this side of suspense in a vacuum where others 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.650
 can not breastfeed pleasant a flight connecting my personal projects would be mounted 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.530
 a company framework for example acrobatic works at the same time
