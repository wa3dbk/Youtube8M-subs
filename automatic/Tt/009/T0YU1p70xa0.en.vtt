00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 jo people what everyone starts again 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.740
 human being worthy of a tape footage 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.420
 it was written on the plan there were 120 75 on 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 So seven sets of five 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.980
 repeats the verge of a load 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 So I'm already me 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 i would say im two weeks 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.939
 distortion with the emergency but I thought 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 me the figure is soon and then i can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 just when I not right in the figure 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.349
 I can do that as a stop 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 who use there 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.750
 that's why I have the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.529
 In any case, last two weeks with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.410
 pulled through 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.559
 I have to say it will not be easier 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 So I am already well over myself 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.230
 quite honestly say and unity 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 was really hard 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.320
 especially two days before, there was one 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.760
 military unit yes with 85 kilos and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 that was really on the border that I have to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.670
 quite frankly, that's you by the way 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.500
 So as always a postbank yes the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 take a break longer but the shorter 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.739
 are definitely there for people who love it 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.090
 maybe not see if not 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 can recognize the video for a short time 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.960
 stop or on the lobo so do the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
 Definitely, most of the time, I hope to pause 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 Anyway, and I'm not power 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.680
 Lifter I just stop to do that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.509
 momentum to take out just so 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 maximum to push out of the breast and 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.799
 did not build a bit somehow 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 Just take a little swing with you 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 and maybe not me in the end 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.369
 to have improved but simply 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.170
 to have harder with us 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.200
 Last on spare 400 kilo I think 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 entrepreneur then it was also absolutely 29 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.270
 75 people have been with me for some time 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 they are following me 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 some years already almost one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.869
 breast injury have it is a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 there has been a crack in the chest and it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.640
 is just like with kneel I leave 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.170
 it just does not heal 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 and yes it starts again I say 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.770
 to disturb me a bit 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.390
 starts to hurt a bit again 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.119
 that's why I have an increased 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.460
 military press just received yes 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.470
 press the workload for the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.290
 not to reduce but at least on 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.760
 to reduce the breast and I think so 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.100
 I can not handle it, I'm really 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.030
 times two three weeks the chest one in 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.340
 to rest 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 but i can i this is really sick one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.920
 So in part I have the feeling that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.989
 I do not coach myself so well 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 So the other people could be different 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.040
 people very easy one I would recommend to anyone 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.410
 recommend a break but if I 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.170
 not yourself coach must come because yes 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.920
 This shit ambition again and again 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.140
 the fore 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.060
 because I too athletes so if 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.090
 I coach myself, I stop and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.910
 athlete and there prevails the belief athlete 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.440
 me sometimes the ambition of the athlete 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.390
 win over the reason of the coach 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000
 say what you do to everyone 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.320
 fall off and we'll break 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.760
 the breast again and that would not be so 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.280
 cool frankly yes yes away from the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.690
 negative thoughts in any case many 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.010
 I was also wondering how long I was 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.489
 actually make breaks between the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.040
 sets 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.319
 So generally for all exercises except 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.330
 Now I would say it is cruising 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.920
 maximum between so in the whole 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.410
 heavy set between three and five 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.200
 minutes where I too dependent 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.720
 make it as good as the set if 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 I realize I have to do 55 now and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.209
 the set was mega events and I only have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 on 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.829
 then you can not go five minutes and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.870
 yes, if I am I find it easy now 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.239
 easy go and i think hey quite 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.070
 honestly make it harder now 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.280
 then I can do more directions 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.320
 three minutes break on the lock out so 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 the last repetition actually 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.230
 always with lockout with me the first 23 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.239
 I would say I always score 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.100
 because the power is still sufficient and 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.450
 yes if the performance has it when he gets tired too 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.820
 I will be strong in any case 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.220
 to lure so whatever 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.620
 Whatever you call that, I like it 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.410
 do not know how to call it 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.450
 but yes pumping through simply has no 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.760
 special meaning except that one one 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.620
 a bit more relevant volume on the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.500
 Breast gets because the breast just more 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.670
 But otherwise you have to work 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.560
 You can relax 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.019
 as I said I always stop when it 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.430
 because if I notice now the dumbbell 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.310
 moving very slowly for a short time 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.930
 durchzuschnaufen again 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.109
 So take a fresh breath so do not rest up 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.549
 is always directly up and yes if 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.769
 she said being too heavy again when 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.380
 I will need new air again then 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.180
 just made a lockout by the way the 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.450
 in any case always on the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.520
 Bank 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.410
 So as I said when I'm not power 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.870
 Lifter but I have to stop some 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.310
 always leave variables the same and the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.070
 butt is always definitely on the bank 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.419
 also you may always see it that way 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.130
 because if yes, if not behind it on the 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.500
 Bank is then you can again 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.060
 Press 10 km or as the case may be 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.570
 extreme that maybe even makes 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.940
 more 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.570
 but yes it was already with the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.220
 Video 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.900
 I still wish you how to get one 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.130
 extremely bright day if you like the video 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.960
 Please, give me one 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.389
 thumbs up and subscribed 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.650
 chat the video with the whole world 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.900
 Otherwise, of course, we'll see each other like that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.900
 always in the next video the skin
