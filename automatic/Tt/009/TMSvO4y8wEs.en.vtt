the iPad this is a universal app as well

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
the iPad this is a universal app as well
so<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.390> look<00:00:57.420> beautiful<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> iphone

I<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> iPad<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.750> better

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I like the iPad a little bit better

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.389 
I like the iPad a little bit better
because<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.440> an<00:01:01.590> option<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.100> actually

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
because there is an option to actually

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
because there is an option to actually
write<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.940> word<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> extra

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
write out the word and with the extra

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
write out the word and with the extra
space<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.549> easier<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> my

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
space and it's a little bit easier in my

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
space and it's a little bit easier in my
opinion<00:01:06.229> because<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.560> course<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.860> reached

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
opinion because of course I'm reached

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
opinion because of course I'm reached
the<00:01:08.490> alphanumeric<00:01:08.820> system<00:01:09.540> instead<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.990> when

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
app that would give it a little bit

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.510 
app that would give it a little bit
something<00:04:23.960> extra

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
something extra

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.700 
something extra
something<00:04:26.520> as<00:04:26.640> well<00:04:26.880> that<00:04:27.060> i<00:04:27.120> was<00:04:27.240> thinking<00:04:27.510> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
something as well that i was thinking of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.580 
something as well that i was thinking of
is<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.310> application<00:04:30.080> doesn't<00:04:31.080> have<00:04:31.350> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
is that the application doesn't have the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.590 
is that the application doesn't have the
alphabet<00:04:32.130> written<00:04:32.580> out<00:04:32.730> if<00:04:33.300> there's<00:04:33.480> a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
alphabet written out if there's a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.700 
alphabet written out if there's a
section<00:04:33.810> where<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.050> could<00:04:34.200> actually<00:04:34.230> see

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
section where you could actually see

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.650 
section where you could actually see
what<00:04:34.950> those<00:04:35.160> let<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.670> with<00:04:35.790> these<00:04:35.910> symbols<00:04:36.450> all

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
what those let it with these symbols all

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.070 
what those let it with these symbols all
stand<00:04:37.590> for<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.910> what<00:04:39.560> they<00:04:40.560> represent<00:04:42.080> that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
stand for and what they represent that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.350 
stand for and what they represent that
would<00:04:43.320> be<00:04:43.500> an<00:04:43.740> easy<00:04:43.980> way<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.610> kind<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.790> drive

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
would be an easy way to to kind of drive

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.570 
would be an easy way to to kind of drive
all<00:04:45.570> those<00:04:45.750> lessons<00:04:46.200> home<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> I<00:04:47.160> really

kind<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.820> found<00:04:47.970> myself<00:04:48.060> wishing<00:04:48.510> for<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:51.500> we

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
kind of found myself wishing for that we

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.070 
kind of found myself wishing for that we
got<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> conversational<00:04:53.400> factor<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.360> right

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
got a conversational factor and a right

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.790 
got a conversational factor and a right
out<00:04:55.230> of<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:56.900> outfits<00:04:57.900> these<00:04:58.380> did<00:04:58.560> various

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
out of the outfits these did various

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.230 
out of the outfits these did various
different<00:04:59.160> languages<00:04:59.520> that<00:04:59.700> we're<00:05:00.150> not

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
different languages that we're not

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120 
different languages that we're not
familiar<00:05:00.690> with<00:05:00.870> obviously<00:05:01.740> when<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:01.950> go<00:05:02.070> to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
familiar with obviously when you go to

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.880 
familiar with obviously when you go to
Spanish<00:05:02.940> or<00:05:03.690> French<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:04.290> gets<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.500> little<00:05:04.680> bit

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
Spanish or French that gets a little bit

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.300 
Spanish or French that gets a little bit
easier<00:05:05.010> because<00:05:05.520> it's<00:05:05.820> all<00:05:06.350> alphanumeric<00:05:07.350> but

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
easier because it's all alphanumeric but

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.590 
easier because it's all alphanumeric but
then<00:05:08.430> some<00:05:08.640> things<00:05:08.820> happen<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.270> sometimes

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
then some things happen to sometimes

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.210 
then some things happen to sometimes
that<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.810> know<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.110> dark<00:05:10.590> blue<00:05:12.830> yeah<00:05:13.830> so

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
that you know this is dark blue yeah so

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.380 
that you know this is dark blue yeah so
what's<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.460> rhythm<00:05:14.610> here<00:05:14.880> is<00:05:15.000> now<00:05:15.150> what<00:05:15.270> they

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
what's the rhythm here is now what they

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.690 
what's the rhythm here is now what they
actually<00:05:15.540> said<00:05:15.810> out<00:05:15.960> loud<00:05:15.990> either<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.010> there's

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
actually said out loud either so there's

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.190 
actually said out loud either so there's
a<00:05:17.760> couple<00:05:17.850> glitches<00:05:18.360> like<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.750> just<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:18.990> give

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
a couple glitches like that just to give

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.360 
a couple glitches like that just to give
