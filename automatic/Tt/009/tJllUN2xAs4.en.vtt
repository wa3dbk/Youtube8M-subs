00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
received a couple emails from some folks

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.450 
received a couple emails from some folks
asking<00:00:04.259> about<00:00:04.440> making<00:00:04.770> adjustments<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
asking about making adjustments to the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.550 
asking about making adjustments to the
bio<00:00:05.670> pellet<00:00:05.970> reactor<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> fluidization

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
bio pellet reactor and the fluidization

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940 
bio pellet reactor and the fluidization
of<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.980> media<00:00:08.309> inside<00:00:09.290> primarily<00:00:10.290> with

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
of the media inside primarily with

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.490 
of the media inside primarily with
concerns<00:00:11.370> about<00:00:11.519> having<00:00:12.300> more<00:00:12.719> flow<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.290> one

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
concerns about having more flow on one

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.700 
concerns about having more flow on one
side<00:00:14.120> than<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.389> other<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.350> case<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
side than on the other in this case you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.099 
side than on the other in this case you
can<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.070> balanced<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
can see it's balanced but what I want to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.400 
can see it's balanced but what I want to
show<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> adjust<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:21.410> for

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
show you is the way you adjust that for

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.790 
show you is the way you adjust that for
example<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> come<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> reactor<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.800> use

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
example if you come to the reactor I use

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.109 
example if you come to the reactor I use
they<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.130> pair<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> channellocks

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
they use a pair of channellocks

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.500 
they use a pair of channellocks
and<00:00:27.539> right<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.650> union<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and right here this union you can just

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.659 
and right here this union you can just
gently<00:00:30.869> loosen<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> where<00:00:32.579> it's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
gently loosen this up not to where it's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
gently loosen this up not to where it's
leaking<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> course<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.450> this'll<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
leaking of course but this'll it's a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
leaking of course but this'll it's a
little<00:00:34.170> loose<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
little loose and then what you do is you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.610 
little loose and then what you do is you
take<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.270> channel<00:00:36.570> locks<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.469> come

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
take the channel locks you just come

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
take the channel locks you just come
around<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.950> section<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.120> grab<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
around this section here you grab it and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.700 
around this section here you grab it and
you<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.750> turn<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.379> now<00:00:40.500> you'll<00:00:40.649> see

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you just turn it so now you'll see

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
you just turn it so now you'll see
there's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.399> flow<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> side<00:00:42.059> see

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
there's a lot more flow on this side see

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.569 
there's a lot more flow on this side see
how<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.340> overflowing<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
how it's kind of overflowing on this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.959 
how it's kind of overflowing on this
side<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.440> side<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
side and then on this side you see it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.720 
side and then on this side you see it's
not<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.450> getting<00:00:48.870> any<00:00:48.989> movement<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.410> all

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
not really getting any movement at all

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.049 
not really getting any movement at all
so<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> fix<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> problem<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:53.059> come

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so to fix that problem what you do come

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.260 
so to fix that problem what you do come
in<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.449> channel<00:00:55.199> locks<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.030> gently

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
in here channel locks and just gently

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.390 
in here channel locks and just gently
move<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.920> fitting

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.620 

to<00:01:01.940> where<00:01:02.060> you<00:01:02.120> start<00:01:02.330> getting<00:01:03.190> same<00:01:04.190> flow<00:01:04.630> on

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
to where you start getting same flow on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.950 
to where you start getting same flow on
both<00:01:05.840> sides

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
both sides

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.430 
both sides

[Music]

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.950 
[Music]
a<00:01:08.470> little<00:01:08.620> bit<00:01:08.740> much<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.040> this<00:01:09.160> side

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
a little bit much on this side

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.600 
a little bit much on this side
and<00:01:11.440> there<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:11.620> go<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.890> have<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.130> same<00:01:12.430> flow

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
and there you go I have the same flow

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.160 
and there you go I have the same flow
here<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.530> have<00:01:14.560> here<00:01:15.660> of<00:01:16.660> course<00:01:16.960> there's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
here as you have here of course there's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.330 
here as you have here of course there's
always<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.410> handle<00:01:17.830> which<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.100> use<00:01:18.310> to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
always the handle which you use to

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.210 
always the handle which you use to
control<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.000> flow<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.770> tumbling<00:01:21.100> in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
control the flow of a tumbling in

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.280 
control the flow of a tumbling in
general<00:01:21.610> what<00:01:22.510> you're<00:01:22.690> seeing<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
general what you're seeing here is the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.660 
general what you're seeing here is the
kind<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.590> flow<00:01:23.830> rate<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.070> recommend<00:01:24.490> it's<00:01:24.610> a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
kind of flow rate I recommend it's a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.300 
kind of flow rate I recommend it's a
great<00:01:24.850> gentle<00:01:25.090> tumble<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:26.260> little<00:01:27.220> more

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
great gentle tumble a little more

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.830 
great gentle tumble a little more
violent<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.820> bottom<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.330> as<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.540> pellets

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
violent on the bottom and as the pellets

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.680 
violent on the bottom and as the pellets
get<00:01:28.960> recycled<00:01:29.440> it's<00:01:29.560> more<00:01:29.800> gentle<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.310> top

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
get recycled it's more gentle on the top

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.420 
get recycled it's more gentle on the top
you<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.720> turn<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.140> up<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.860> course<00:01:33.130> when<00:01:33.340> you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
you can turn it up of course when you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.650 
you can turn it up of course when you
get<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.580> little<00:01:33.850> more<00:01:34.350> movement<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.420> really

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
get a little more movement if you really

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.330 
get a little more movement if you really
cranked<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.960> up<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.380> model<00:01:38.650> 1000<00:01:39.220> it's

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
cranked it up this is a model 1000 it's

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.670 
cranked it up this is a model 1000 it's
got<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.510> neat<00:01:40.510> I'm<00:01:40.690> five<00:01:40.930> thousand<00:01:41.350> five<00:01:41.440> money

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
got a neat I'm five thousand five money

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.460 
got a neat I'm five thousand five money
it'll<00:01:41.860> start<00:01:42.100> really<00:01:42.280> whipping<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.700> there<00:01:43.470> I'm

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
it'll start really whipping in there I'm

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.350 
it'll start really whipping in there I'm
not<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.860> big<00:01:45.130> advocate<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.060> sort<00:01:46.300> of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
not a big advocate of this sort of

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.740 
not a big advocate of this sort of
tumbling<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.290> think<00:01:47.500> it's<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.680> little<00:01:47.770> bit<00:01:47.979> rough

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
tumbling I think it's a little bit rough

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.930 
tumbling I think it's a little bit rough
and<00:01:49.750> you'll<00:01:49.869> give<00:01:49.990> too<00:01:50.110> much<00:01:50.259> sharing<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.940> do

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
and you'll give too much sharing I do

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
some excess biofilm but it should be a

some excess biofilm but it should be a
gentle<00:02:02.920> tumble<00:02:03.280> for<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.490> most<00:02:03.670> part<00:02:03.880> also<00:02:04.450> if

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
you see any bio pellets up on the intake

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.490 
you see any bio pellets up on the intake
screen<00:02:07.390> which<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.810> there<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.080> protect<00:02:08.229> them

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
screen which is there to protect them

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.169 
screen which is there to protect them
from<00:02:08.590> going<00:02:08.830> into<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> pump<00:02:09.250> all<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.729> is

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
from going into the pump all you do is

from going into the pump all you do is
take<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.110> handle<00:02:11.470> turn<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.130> off<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.790> you'll
