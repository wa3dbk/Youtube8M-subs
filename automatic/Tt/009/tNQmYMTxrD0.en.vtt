00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hey you pokemon trainer welcome to the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.020
 top5 ugliest pokémon ever 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.550
 At least for me, notice that 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.170
 my own opinion is me and myself 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.559
 be consistent with your opinion 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.950
 can 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.260
 Place number five goes to the pokémon 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 paraffin it the name sounds already 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 funny about the look of this pokémon 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
 based on a leprechaun with the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 a chan chan dancer clothes what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 where you sit because I am there 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.830
 probably deprived that one 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.929
 Historian definitely sees the thing 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.270
 unbelievable fucking house that can never 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.160
 to represent a dancer in life as 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.719
 remark here is kubicki his 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.300
 entire exterior resembles that 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 appearance of a god i directed 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 even at that time was different from these 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 this gallop will make me because 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.739
 pursue life what the devil is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.190
 there on the head of the thing that is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 but no hair now 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.270
 Hair care products use this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.000
 pokémon does not really matter what it is 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.320
 changing weather place 5 pa finesse 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 that moment when you're after that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360
 fifth place no longer has room 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.369
 Number 4 beta in size is that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.939
 pokémon yes sweet little one 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 eyes to small mouth has huge scene 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.330
 it's that around it that's no 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 no, that can not be 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:31.049
 is that a shit like the zaro hear me 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.600
 you have ever had such a razor 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.829
 is such a razor with which you are so good 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.750
 can cut off 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.390
 buy yourself I'll give you an old one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.850
 I swear I give you a ban 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 to better class this place four 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.600
 pizza place number three goes to throw 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.070
 Terry Bach I honestly have to admit that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 I am the first stage of development and the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.810
 last stage of development of the pokémon 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.390
 ok for just that middle thing is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.329
 I really do not have any 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.369
 another word for that one i have though 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.330
 No idea what game freak for a bad 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:14.310
 active 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 but why such a dog even 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.920
 Do not come to two place to experience the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.810
 the fetish full from place 3 teri bank 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.000
 if you think it's bad 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.490
 fetish does not get worse then sets 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.530

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.190
 thinks okay has a big nose you can 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.670
 but let that stand 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.470
 further development has a big nose 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.900
 oversized big nose and then 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.600
 this bush under it really 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.910
 This fat bush could be one 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.320
 hide all nation in that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.850
 no year the game freak is with 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.400
 This pokémon has done her beard 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.670
 to act properly 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.209
 but why at our expense it looks 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.070
 me at night all the time the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.430
 less is yes that these two poor the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.770
 the thing has stuck there so are 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.500

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.840
 that's hare the thing has three bunnies 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.519
 A middle-class is currently on 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.130
 Place number two goes to the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.050
 unshaven volumes my very 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.000
 dear ladies and gentlemen, I may him 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 place number one 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.650
 He is big tanned and good looking 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 Place number one occupied landfill teams 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.519
 a fucking ruptured garbage I've offered 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.540
 really no idea what the smoked 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.209
 but this pokémon is by far the most 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.620
 ugliest thing I have ever seen 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.330
 It can not even do that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.530
 to keep up with 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.890
 Let's try something 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.780
 to see more rational does not work 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.280
 is still likely garbage bags 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.290
 was at the design of this pokemon 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.970
 apparently you know what I have 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.209
 no longer bitch on the shit place 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.459
 Number one landfill talks with or without 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.410

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.640
