looking machine and we were lucky enough

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.560 
looking machine and we were lucky enough
to<00:00:44.769> see<00:00:45.039> it<00:00:45.129> take<00:00:45.280> its<00:00:45.489> first<00:00:45.699> baby<00:00:46.000> steps<00:00:46.329> onto

to see it take its first baby steps onto

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.439 
to see it take its first baby steps onto
public<00:00:46.989> roads<00:00:47.280> today<00:00:48.280> though<00:00:48.519> we're<00:00:49.089> here<00:00:49.269> to

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
public roads today though we're here to

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.880 

so<00:00:59.149> since<00:00:59.390> we've<00:00:59.600> been<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.899> radical<00:01:00.140> last<00:01:00.590> year

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
so since we've been a radical last year

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.250 
so since we've been a radical last year
a<00:01:00.920> lot<00:01:01.309> has<00:01:01.489> changed<00:01:01.840> when<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:02.930> were<00:01:03.079> there

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
a lot has changed when we were there

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.530 
a lot has changed when we were there
they<00:01:03.379> had<00:01:03.410> one<00:01:03.890> rxe<00:01:04.489> their<00:01:04.699> prototype<00:01:05.360> they

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
they had one rxe their prototype they

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.840 
they had one rxe their prototype they
were<00:01:05.600> just<00:01:05.930> about<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.350> test<00:01:06.560> for<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.800> road<00:01:07.010> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
were just about to test for the road and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.310 
were just about to test for the road and
now<00:01:08.090> we've<00:01:08.479> been<00:01:08.659> there<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.020> there's<00:01:09.229> an

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
now we've been there and there's an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.350 
now we've been there and there's an
absolute<00:01:09.680> transformation<00:01:10.060> go<00:01:11.060> onto<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
absolute transformation go onto the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.359 
absolute transformation go onto the
assembly<00:01:11.750> line<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.050> SR<00:01:12.350> threes<00:01:12.650> now<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.159> our

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
assembly line of SR threes now it's our

certainly<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:39.940> real<00:01:40.150> driving<00:01:40.540> experience

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
certainly is the real driving experience

certainly is the real driving experience
and<00:01:41.560> as<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.700> picked<00:01:43.000> an<00:01:43.630> incredibly<00:01:44.170> wet<00:01:44.920> road

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and as we picked an incredibly wet road

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.910 
and as we picked an incredibly wet road
for<00:01:45.610> me<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.880> have<00:01:45.970> my<00:01:46.000> rxe<00:01:46.659> debut<00:01:47.080> it's<00:01:47.770> a

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
for me to have my rxe debut it's a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
for me to have my rxe debut it's a
little<00:01:48.430> intimidating

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.160 

there's<00:01:58.740> such<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> racecar<00:01:59.850> feel<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.930> being

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
there's such a racecar feel to being

there's such a racecar feel to being
sign<00:02:01.409> here<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.220> tell<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.970> isn't

racecar that you can incidentally drive

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
racecar that you can incidentally drive
on<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> road<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.600> look<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.929> side

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
on the road when you look in your side

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
on the road when you look in your side
mirrors<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> bloody<00:02:11.760> great<00:02:12.150> wing

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
mirrors and you see a bloody great wing

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
mirrors and you see a bloody great wing
staring<00:02:13.080> back<00:02:13.230> at<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.270> change<00:02:15.540> your

staring back at you you can change your
steering<00:02:15.989> assists<00:02:16.440> from<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.100> five<00:02:17.280> but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
steering assists from one to five but

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520 
steering assists from one to five but
even<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.850> five<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.239> still<00:02:18.480> feels<00:02:18.720> remarkably

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
even at five it still feels remarkably

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.320 
even at five it still feels remarkably
intuitive<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.280> feels<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.850> car<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.209> an

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
intuitive it feels like the car is an

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.360 
intuitive it feels like the car is an
extension<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.900> yourself<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.890> feeling<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
extension of yourself the feeling the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.340 
extension of yourself the feeling the
pedals<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.090> pure<00:02:24.360> race<00:02:24.630> car<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.319> a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
pedals is just pure race car and on a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.290 
pedals is just pure race car and on a
wet<00:02:25.560> day<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.700> don't<00:02:26.819> need<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.090> tell

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
wet day like this you don't need to tell

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.729 
wet day like this you don't need to tell
it<00:02:27.330> twice<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.050> get<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.470> bit<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
it twice to get a little bit out of

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.280 
it twice to get a little bit out of
shape<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> responsiveness<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
shape but it's the responsiveness that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.800 
shape but it's the responsiveness that
gives<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.680> confidence

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.920 

the<00:02:37.050> riot<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.650> just<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.970> shocking<00:02:39.510> how<00:02:39.660> good

the riot is just it's shocking how good
it<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.740> obviously<00:02:41.160> not<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> be

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it is it's obviously not going to be

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.250 
it is it's obviously not going to be

comfortable enough to drive across

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.530 
comfortable enough to drive across
continent<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.610> you'd<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.940> stupid<00:02:45.209> for

continent but you'd be stupid for

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
thinking you'd want to do that anyway

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.820 
thinking you'd want to do that anyway
you'd<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> bit<00:02:48.540> mad<00:02:48.750> my<00:02:49.590> radical

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.300 
not fancying the jolt in the back you
can<00:03:44.000> actually<00:03:44.330> dip<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.690> clutch<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.800> go<00:03:46.040> up

can actually dip the clutch and go up

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.670 
can actually dip the clutch and go up
and<00:03:46.490> down<00:03:46.580> through<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.910> gears<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.500> and

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
and down through the gears like so and

and down through the gears like so and
you<00:03:48.740> got<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> nice<00:03:49.010> smooth<00:03:49.280> down<00:03:49.490> change<00:03:49.790> but<00:03:50.690> if

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
you got a nice smooth down change but if

this
and<00:04:34.470> it'd<00:04:34.980> be<00:04:35.010> financially<00:04:35.820> viable

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.490 

you<00:04:40.979> just<00:04:41.220> find<00:04:41.400> yourself<00:04:41.990> pushing<00:04:42.990> harder

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
track you see the white lines you're so

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.780 
track you see the white lines you're so

low to the ground you're thrust forward

low to the ground you're thrust forward

and immediately you're at 7/10 it is

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.140 
and immediately you're at 7/10 it is

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
just a race car through and through I

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.690 
just a race car through and through I
can't<00:05:04.480> say<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.960> often<00:05:05.470> enough

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
can't say that often enough

allowed to drive it

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.680 
allowed to drive it
it's<00:05:14.579> not<00:05:14.819> the<00:05:14.939> cheapest<00:05:15.359> of<00:05:15.509> things

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
it's not the cheapest of things

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.990 
it's not the cheapest of things

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.469 
but I think a hundred thousand pounds
for<00:05:19.840> a<00:05:19.900> racecar<00:05:20.640> like<00:05:21.640> this
