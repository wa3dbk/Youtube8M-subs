this engine let me ask you to explain to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630 
this engine let me ask you to explain to
me<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> Hemi<00:01:22.200> engine<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> well<00:01:23.520> your

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
me what a Hemi engine is well your

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
me what a Hemi engine is well your
standard<00:01:24.030> v8<00:01:24.270> engine<00:01:24.630> has<00:01:24.869> eight<00:01:25.290> cylinders

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
standard v8 engine has eight cylinders

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
standard v8 engine has eight cylinders
that's<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> v8<00:01:26.759> stands<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.360> each

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that's what the v8 stands for each

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.440 
that's what the v8 stands for each
cylinder<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.520> what<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> says<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> cylinder

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
cylinder is what it says it's a cylinder

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.410 
cylinder is what it says it's a cylinder
but<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> flat<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.530> much<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.420> silo

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
but it has a flat top much like a silo

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.710 
but it has a flat top much like a silo
the<00:01:34.380> Hemi<00:01:34.619> engine<00:01:35.340> features<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> rounded<00:01:36.540> top

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the Hemi engine features a rounded top

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
the Hemi engine features a rounded top
so<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> internal<00:01:37.680> combustion<00:01:38.130> happens

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so when the internal combustion happens

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.090 
so when the internal combustion happens
the<00:01:39.240> explosion<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> round<00:01:40.259> explosion<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the explosion is a round explosion and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
the explosion is a round explosion and
you<00:01:41.579> actually<00:01:41.970> use<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> power<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you actually use more of the power of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
you actually use more of the power of
the<00:01:43.320> explosion<00:01:43.439> than<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.250> standard<00:01:44.460> engine

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the explosion than your standard engine

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.929 
the explosion than your standard engine
so<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.329> get<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.530> same<00:01:46.820> with<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
so you get more out of the same with the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.639 
so you get more out of the same with the
Hemi<00:01:48.119> engine<00:01:48.479> you've<00:01:48.720> made<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.140> changes<00:01:49.409> in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
Hemi engine you've made some changes in

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.609 
Hemi engine you've made some changes in
the<00:01:49.860> back<00:01:50.040> end<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.850> suspension<00:01:51.270> right

this sort of technology to it we've used

think of leaf springs on trucks they

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.270 
think of leaf springs on trucks they
think<00:02:24.200> that's<00:02:24.379> what<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.590> need<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.250> the

RAM designers this year have decided to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.940 
RAM designers this year have decided to
use<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.569> empty<00:03:35.720> space<00:03:36.169> that<00:03:36.470> was<00:03:36.560> between<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
use the empty space that was between the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.949 
use the empty space that was between the
sidewall<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:37.819> where<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> wheelwell<00:03:38.630> ended

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.039 
sidewall and where the wheelwell ended
inside<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:39.709> create<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.519> dry<00:03:40.940> lockable<00:03:41.810> and

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
inside and create a dry lockable and

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.680 
inside and create a dry lockable and
even<00:03:42.590> illuminated<00:03:43.190> storage<00:03:43.579> space<00:03:43.880> the

even illuminated storage space the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.360 
even illuminated storage space the
storage<00:03:45.049> space<00:03:45.319> is<00:03:45.530> large<00:03:45.709> enough<00:03:45.859> to<00:03:46.040> hold<00:03:46.190> a

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
storage space is large enough to hold a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.970 
storage space is large enough to hold a
golf<00:03:46.609> bag<00:03:46.849> but<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.260> like<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.620> best<00:03:48.650> is

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
golf bag but what I like the best is

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.440 
golf bag but what I like the best is
that<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.280> actually<00:03:49.400> has<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.669> drain<00:03:49.940> plug<00:03:50.150> in<00:03:50.359> the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
that it actually has a drain plug in the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.539 
that it actually has a drain plug in the
bottom<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.109> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.349> put<00:03:51.530> ice<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.250> a<00:03:52.400> whole

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
bottom so you can put ice and a whole

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.309 
bottom so you can put ice and a whole
bunch<00:03:52.579> of<00:03:52.849> drinks<00:03:53.030> in<00:03:53.239> here<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.599> something<00:03:54.079> up
