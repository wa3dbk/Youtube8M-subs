00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello guys today I bring a beautiful tip 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.610
 from europe it 's for you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 How about you learn how to do this beautiful 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.100
 wallet purse with precious crystals 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.939
 see how easy it is but to teach the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 step by step receive maria rossetti be 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.930
 Welcome to her, let's go to the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.930
 material ratio 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.640
 well then today we dont like 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.909
 customize a simple and 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.329
 transform it with the collage of crystals 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:05.479
 and chestnuts are the steps are the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.880
 with the pouch 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.970
 Lisa we already bought Let's get the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 tape is of gorgorÃ£o to leave more or less 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.420
 three to four fingers so that we can 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 necklace that brings the finish and we 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.759
 let's identify which space 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.399
 we have to glue the crystals 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.369
 I already have another marked tape here 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.240
 and I used two opponents two needles to 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.159
 Mark 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.630
 exactly this space where I go 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.630
 paste my crystals 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.670
 so I have here another tape that 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.979
 she already has some glued crystals 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.920
 and I left four spaces for the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.770
 or as nuts then subsequently 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.840
 I 'm going to sew the nuts 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560
 so now we're going to paste the album of the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.130
 crystals 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 I'll choose a chosen color pink 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.320
 I'm going to lean here with a little bit 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.549
 a little bit of glue and a little bit of 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.150
 tooth 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.010
 so I'm going to pass the glue that brings 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:18.200
 just a little bit because it does not spread 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.359
 A lot and I'll stick what 's here I go 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.500
 paste the crystal hold a few seconds 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:27.079
 three to four seconds and then release 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.390
 so I'm putting all the others 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.069
 such as leaving the sewing 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 the nuts 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.450
 Good for this job I like to use 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 particularly the glue and 6 thousand is a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.739
 which has a relative drying 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.989
 and she does not really go out and I go 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.670
 sew the nuts 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.090
 So this one is an issue that wins 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.900
 people chose some colors that are 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.900
 these 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.299
 and I'll sew one of the nuts here 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.120
 I already have another track prepared 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.970
 with all the crystals glued together and 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.430
 Glue time already finished I already 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.139
 I used a chestnut the chestnut has 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.260
 two holes 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.659
 so it's quite simple to sew I go 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.639
 to pass from this side then I 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.439
 my line on the needle or pass this 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:22.290
 very simple side 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:25.109
 I put the brown here and I will give 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.599
 point on the other side, no problem 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:33.299
 back side get a little confused because 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:37.019
 how she will get stuck in the bag she does not 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.560
 this finish will appear 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.949
 if you prefer you can give one or the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.449
 other 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:48.780
 another point is to make it stronger 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:56.569
 I'm going to finish here, just give me one. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:04:00.569
 and cut and I'll make the other nuts 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.750
 the completion of the scholarship is very simple and I 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.040
 I come here also use the glue and six 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.819
 thousand and can even take the help of some 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.569
 entrepreneurs so that the glue is paste 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:19.620
 faster then the finished bag 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.710
 she's going to look exactly like this with linda 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.289
 Maria, thank you, now you can. 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.000
 parade with your bag around or up 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.720
 even market 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.940
 subscribe to our channel on youtube and 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.479
 do not miss the next tip until the next
