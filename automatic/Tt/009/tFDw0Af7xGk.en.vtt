00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.150 
so if they're not worried about him then
they're<00:00:39.930> they're<00:00:40.260> clearly<00:00:40.530> mistaken<00:00:40.800> because

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
they're they're clearly mistaken because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130 
as talented as Derrick Rose he's
essentially<00:00:44.850> doing<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.390> Derrick<00:00:45.690> Rose<00:00:45.870> does

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
