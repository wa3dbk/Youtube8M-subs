is<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:39.329> jelly<00:01:39.750> bean<00:01:39.960> button<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.130> what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
is this little jelly bean button so what

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
is this little jelly bean button so what
this<00:01:41.759> button<00:01:42.000> does<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> allows<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.110> be

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
this button does is it allows it to be
