00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
actually have the pads I used to kind of

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.710 
actually have the pads I used to kind of
pick<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.580> pitch<00:00:21.850> because<00:00:22.180> I<00:00:22.240> probably<00:00:22.510> won't

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720

Arthur<00:00:27.460> always<00:00:27.640> never<00:00:28.030> I<00:00:28.360> think<00:00:28.960> one<00:00:29.080> of<00:00:29.110> the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
Arthur always never I think one of the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.400 
Arthur always never I think one of the
main<00:00:29.470> things<00:00:29.770> when<00:00:29.920> you're<00:00:30.040> holding<00:00:30.190> edges

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
main things when you're holding edges

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.720 
main things when you're holding edges
the<00:00:32.410> pan<00:00:32.649> should<00:00:32.680> actually<00:00:33.010> represent<00:00:33.700> the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
the pan should actually represent the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.520 
the pan should actually represent the
guy's<00:00:34.000> head<00:00:34.329> so<00:00:34.690> obviously<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:38.110> want<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.350> keep

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
guy's head so obviously we want to keep

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.110 
guy's head so obviously we want to keep
the<00:00:38.710> pants<00:00:38.950> in<00:00:39.160> almost<00:00:39.370> like<00:00:39.610> you're<00:00:39.790> scoring

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
the pants in almost like you're scoring

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.330 
the pants in almost like you're scoring
do<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.600> kind<00:00:41.260> of<00:00:41.320> keep<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> point<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.100> pins

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
do is kind of keep the point the pins

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.260 
do is kind of keep the point the pins
moving<00:00:42.700> in<00:00:42.790> front<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.090> your<00:00:43.180> face<00:00:44.910> basic<00:00:45.910> combo

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
moving in front of your face basic combo

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.569 
moving in front of your face basic combo
is<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.510> jab<00:00:46.780> two<00:00:46.990> one<00:00:47.200> two<00:00:47.470> then<00:00:48.370> we're<00:00:48.489> gonna

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
is the jab two one two then we're gonna

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.430 
is the jab two one two then we're gonna
go<00:00:48.760> into<00:00:48.940> how<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.150> get<00:00:49.360> an<00:00:49.480> angle<00:00:49.600> for<00:00:50.290> some

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
go into how to get an angle for some

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:46.440 
go into how to get an angle for some
punches

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.790 

okay<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.510> it's<00:01:47.780> important<00:01:48.230> for<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.380> guys<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
okay so it's important for the guys to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.010 
okay so it's important for the guys to
start<00:01:49.100> now<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.640> think<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.360> most<00:01:50.510> important

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
start now I think the most important

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.300 
start now I think the most important
thing<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.290> keep<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.590> punches<00:01:51.950> straight

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
thing is to keep your punches straight

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.640 
thing is to keep your punches straight
and<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:53.270> bring<00:01:53.510> them<00:01:53.630> back<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> end<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:54.410> one

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
and to bring them back the end so if one

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.250 
and to bring them back the end so if one
punches<00:01:55.100> out<00:01:55.280> not<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.420> drop<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> other<00:01:56.960> hand

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
punches out not to drop the other hand

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.920 
punches out not to drop the other hand
always<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.740> protected

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
always be protected
