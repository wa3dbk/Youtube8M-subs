to zero so they're all common and we've

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.970 
to zero so they're all common and we've
now<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> digital<00:02:30.060> repeater<00:02:30.840> called<00:02:31.230> gb7

just<00:02:50.610> put<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.090> here<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.830> same

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
just put it in here so it's on the same

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.550 
just put it in here so it's on the same
screen<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.820> can<00:02:53.970> see<00:02:54.180> what's<00:02:54.390> happening<00:02:54.810> so

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
screen you can see what's happening so

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
screen you can see what's happening so
we'll<00:02:55.740> do<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.250> insert<00:02:56.940> there<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.480> create<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
we'll do an insert there and create a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.350 
we'll do an insert there and create a
line<00:02:58.830> at<00:02:59.070> number<00:02:59.370> 42<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:02.910> down<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.270> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
line at number 42 we go down to the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.140 
line at number 42 we go down to the
bottom<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> list<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.560> mouse<00:03:04.830> click<00:03:05.150> do

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
bottom of the list right mouse click do

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.960 
bottom of the list right mouse click do
a<00:03:06.180> copy<00:03:06.800> go<00:03:07.800> back<00:03:07.830> up<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.430> where<00:03:08.580> we've<00:03:08.760> done

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
a copy go back up to where we've done

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.920 
a copy go back up to where we've done
that<00:03:09.120> insert<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.190> paste<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.970> ask<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
that insert and do a paste and ask to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.100 
that insert and do a paste and ask to
overwrite<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.410> line<00:03:13.920> do<00:03:14.430> an<00:03:14.550> ok<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.930> we've

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
overwrite that line do an ok and we've

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.110 
overwrite that line do an ok and we've
now<00:03:16.260> moved<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.830> up<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.730> have<00:03:17.880> two

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
now moved it up but you see we have two

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.970 
now moved it up but you see we have two
copies<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.960> need<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.230> go<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.500> delete<00:03:19.770> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
copies so we need to go and delete the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.170 
copies so we need to go and delete the
original<00:03:20.070> one<00:03:20.580> from<00:03:20.730> down<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.120> bottom<00:03:23.180> delete

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
original one from down the bottom delete

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.290 
original one from down the bottom delete
it<00:03:24.360> yes<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.620> we've<00:03:25.800> now<00:03:25.950> moved<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.700> into

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
it yes so we've now moved that up into

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.080 
it yes so we've now moved that up into
the<00:03:27.420> list<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:29.010> delete<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> line<00:03:29.670> at<00:03:29.940> any

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the list you can delete a line at any

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.390 
the list you can delete a line at any
time<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.660> want<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:31.230> shorten<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> list<00:03:32.010> or

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
time if you want or shorten the list or

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.030 
time if you want or shorten the list or
or<00:03:32.760> move<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.720> list<00:03:33.930> around<00:03:34.230> says<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.770> suits

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
or move the list around says it suits

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.080 
or move the list around says it suits
what<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:36.150> require<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.920> that's<00:03:38.100> created<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
what you you require so that's created a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.830 
what you you require so that's created a
new<00:03:39.600> repeater<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.580> digital<00:03:42.030> section<00:03:42.540> we

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
new repeater in the digital section we

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.920 
new repeater in the digital section we
could<00:03:43.050> go<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.620> FM<00:03:44.190> repeater<00:03:44.750> section<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
could go to the FM repeater section and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.590 
could go to the FM repeater section and
do<00:03:46.680> exactly<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.370> same<00:03:47.610> thing<00:03:47.940> but<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.420> course

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
do exactly the same thing but of course

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.660 
do exactly the same thing but of course
we<00:03:48.780> would<00:03:48.990> pick<00:03:49.170> double<00:03:50.100> click<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.460> there<00:03:50.610> and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
we would pick double click in there and

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.570 
we would pick double click in there and
we'd<00:03:51.360> pick<00:03:51.600> an<00:03:51.870> FM<00:03:52.320> repeater<00:03:52.770> as<00:03:53.070> opposed<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.520> a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
we'd pick an FM repeater as opposed to a

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.530 
we'd pick an FM repeater as opposed to a
digital<00:03:53.760> repeater<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:57.050> delete<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:59.540> we

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
digital repeater just delete that and we

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.990 
digital repeater just delete that and we
could<00:04:00.720> also<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.320> we<00:04:01.440> want<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.770> create<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.700> new

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
could also if we want to create a new

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.590 
could also if we want to create a new
group<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.480> repeaters<00:04:03.900> or<00:04:04.580> for<00:04:05.580> ourselves<00:04:05.700> and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
group of repeaters or for ourselves and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.220 
group of repeaters or for ourselves and
copy<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.410> paste<00:04:07.800> from<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:09.000> existing<00:04:09.960> months

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
copy and paste from the existing months

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.290 
copy and paste from the existing months
into<00:04:10.560> them<00:04:10.710> we<00:04:10.950> must<00:04:11.370> remember<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.910> if<00:04:12.150> you

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
into them we must remember that if you

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.600 
into them we must remember that if you
do<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:13.890> must<00:04:14.190> delete<00:04:14.550> the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
do that that so you must delete the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
do that that so you must delete the
original<00:04:15.360> one<00:04:15.510> or<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:16.020> end<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.380> with

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
original one or your end up with

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.659 
original one or your end up with
duplicates<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.080> that's<00:04:19.080> creating<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.220> new

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
duplicates so that's creating a new

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.280 
duplicates so that's creating a new
entry<00:04:21.180> into<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.810> repeater<00:04:22.260> list

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
entry into the repeater list

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.890 
entry into the repeater list
hope<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.490> been<00:04:24.610> helpful<00:04:24.750> thanks<00:04:25.750> for

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
hope that's been helpful thanks for
