00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.600 

here's<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.740> slightly<00:00:02.040> more<00:00:02.280> complicated

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
here's a slightly more complicated

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.400 
here's a slightly more complicated
mechanical<00:00:03.000> system<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.959> quarter<00:00:04.259> car

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
mechanical system the quarter car

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.960 
mechanical system the quarter car
suspension<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.279> called<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.549> quarter<00:00:05.819> car

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
suspension it's called the quarter car

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.930 
suspension it's called the quarter car
suspension<00:00:06.270> not<00:00:06.720> because<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.519> only<00:00:08.519> want<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
suspension not because we only want to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.339 
suspension not because we only want to
have<00:00:09.030> carts<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.540> made<00:00:09.719> out<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.900> quarters

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
have carts that are made out of quarters

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.650 
have carts that are made out of quarters
but<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.130> represents<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:11.910> 1/4<00:00:12.480> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
but because it represents about 1/4 of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.379 
but because it represents about 1/4 of
the<00:00:12.750> car<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.219> wood<00:00:14.219> represents<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.940> 1/4<00:00:15.179> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the car and wood represents about 1/4 of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.790 
the car and wood represents about 1/4 of
the<00:00:15.480> card<00:00:15.719> because<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.170> dealing<00:00:16.260> with<00:00:16.470> one

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the card because we're dealing with one

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.910 
the card because we're dealing with one
tire<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.490> shock<00:00:17.760> absorber<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.740> other

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
tire one shock absorber and one other

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.410 
tire one shock absorber and one other
spring<00:00:20.310> that's<00:00:20.490> attached<00:00:20.789> from<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> frame<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
spring that's attached from the frame to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.500 
spring that's attached from the frame to
the<00:00:21.810> axle<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.580> case<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the axle so in this case we have a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.029 
the axle so in this case we have a
figure<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.199> looks<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.500> bit<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
figure that looks a little bit like this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.460 
figure that looks a little bit like this
after<00:00:26.400> we've<00:00:26.519> abstracted<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.119> system<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
after we've abstracted the system and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.099 
after we've abstracted the system and
again<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.859> need<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> denote<00:00:29.490> directions<00:00:30.359> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
again we need to denote directions so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.930 
again we need to denote directions so
we're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> name<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.890> state<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.460> Y

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we're going to name one state as Y

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.370 
we're going to name one state as Y
we<00:00:33.059> expect<00:00:33.360> Y<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.780> positive<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.290> this

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we expect Y to be positive in this

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
we expect Y to be positive in this
direction<00:00:34.460> X<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> positive<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.270> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
direction X to be positive in this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.119 
direction X to be positive in this
direction<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> reference<00:00:37.590> art

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
direction and we have a reference art

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.209 
direction and we have a reference art
which<00:00:38.610> conveniently<00:00:39.180> stands<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.840> Road<00:00:40.219> so

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
which conveniently stands for Road so

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
which conveniently stands for Road so
here<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.910> something<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.660> tire

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
here we have something like a tire

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
here we have something like a tire
that's<00:00:43.440> bouncing<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> road<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that's bouncing on the road and then the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.529 
that's bouncing on the road and then the
shock<00:00:45.480> absorber<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> spring<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.920> dampened

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
shock absorber and spring are dampened

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.200 
shock absorber and spring are dampened
above<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.930> actual<00:00:49.260> weight<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> car<00:00:50.210> so

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
above the actual weight of the car so

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.680 
above the actual weight of the car so
these<00:00:51.870> values<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.710> masses<00:00:53.270> usually<00:00:54.270> m2

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
these values have some masses usually m2

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
these values have some masses usually m2
is<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.140> much<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:55.500> greater<00:00:55.710> than<00:00:55.890> m1

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is going to be much much greater than m1

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.189 
is going to be much much greater than m1
here<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> wheel<00:00:57.360> does<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.780> some<00:00:58.020> mass

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
here but the wheel does have some mass

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
here but the wheel does have some mass
and<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> consider<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and so we need to consider that when the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.389 
and so we need to consider that when the
springing<00:00:59.940> around<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:02.039> values

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
springing around we have some values

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
springing around we have some values
that<00:01:02.430> correspond<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> each<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.449> these<00:01:03.570> Springs

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that correspond to each of these Springs

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.660 
that correspond to each of these Springs
as<00:01:04.110> well<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> stiffness<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> two

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
as well so the stiffness of the two

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.090 
as well so the stiffness of the two
Springs<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.270> well<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> amount<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
Springs as well as the amount that the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
Springs as well as the amount that the
dashpot<00:01:08.340> b<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> resisting

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
dashpot b is going to be resisting

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
dashpot b is going to be resisting
changes<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.680> velocity<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.680> our<00:01:13.710> next<00:01:14.100> step

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
changes in velocity so now our next step

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.420 
changes in velocity so now our next step
is<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> decompose<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.810> system<00:01:16.189> again<00:01:17.189> not

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is to decompose the system again not

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
is to decompose the system again not
because<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:18.030> episode<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> CSI

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
because this is an episode of CSI

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.320 
because this is an episode of CSI
but<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.400> advantage<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> linear

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
but because the advantage of linear

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
but because the advantage of linear
system<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.110> decompose<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
system is that we can decompose the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
system is that we can decompose the
component<00:01:23.460> parts<00:01:23.640> solve<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.450> independently

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
component parts solve them independently

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410 
component parts solve them independently
and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.189> answer<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> end<00:01:26.970> that's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and then get an answer at the end that's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
and then get an answer at the end that's
going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> give<00:01:27.990> us<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.470> value<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> system

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to give us the value of the system

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.640 
going to give us the value of the system
we<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.579> recompose<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> answer<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.930> order<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we can recompose that answer in order to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.230 
we can recompose that answer in order to
find<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.979> any<00:01:32.220> value<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> system<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.180> any

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
find out any value of the system at any

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890 
find out any value of the system at any
time<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.369> begin<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:35.880> writing<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> two

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
time so we begin by writing down the two

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
time so we begin by writing down the two
masses<00:01:37.259> m1<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.829> m2<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.640> our<00:01:38.820> Freebody

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.899 
masses m1 and m2 here in our Freebody
diagram<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> we're<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> instead<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
actually going ahead and trying to write

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
actually going ahead and trying to write
the<00:01:43.380> forces<00:01:43.770> down<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.460> are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the forces down what they actually are

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.090 
the forces down what they actually are
I<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.630> wanted<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> denote<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.649> values

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I just wanted to denote the two values

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
I just wanted to denote the two values
of<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> forces<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.909> three<00:01:48.149> values<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
of the forces or the three values in the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
of the forces or the three values in the
case<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> m1<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.100> acting<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.579> these

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
case of m1 that will be acting on these

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
case of m1 that will be acting on these
masses<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.960> two<00:01:52.110> values<00:01:52.500> acting<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.009> M

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
masses so we have two values acting on M

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
masses so we have two values acting on M
-<00:01:53.399> they'll<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.670> acting<00:01:54.060> down<00:01:54.299> three<00:01:55.079> values<00:01:55.259> on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
- they'll be acting down three values on

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
- they'll be acting down three values on
m1<00:01:56.009> -<00:01:56.310> acting<00:01:56.640> upwards<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.149> acting<00:01:57.479> down<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
m1 - acting upwards one acting down and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170 
m1 - acting upwards one acting down and
this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.829> denoted<00:01:59.310> motion<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
this is how we denoted motion on the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730 
this is how we denoted motion on the
left-hand<00:02:00.600> side<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> right-hand<00:02:01.229> side

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
left-hand side and the right-hand side

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.850 
left-hand side and the right-hand side
so<00:02:02.040> let's<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.880> ahead<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.090> label<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.689> F<00:02:04.020> 1<00:02:04.590> F

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
so let's go ahead and label these F 1 F

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
so let's go ahead and label these F 1 F
2<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.399> F<00:02:05.549> 3<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.149> again<00:02:06.810> we've<00:02:06.960> made<00:02:07.140> sure<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
2 and F 3 and again we've made sure that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.710 
2 and F 3 and again we've made sure that
F<00:02:07.590> 1<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.920> F<00:02:08.009> 2<00:02:08.039> correspond<00:02:08.729> correctly<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
F 1 and F 2 correspond correctly on the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.640 
F 1 and F 2 correspond correctly on the
two<00:02:09.869> diagrams<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.270> let's<00:02:12.480> review<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.110> Chi

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
two diagrams so let's review the Chi

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.030 
two diagrams so let's review the Chi
of<00:02:14.420> values<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.959> kinds<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.349> equations<00:02:16.650> that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
of values the kinds of equations that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.610 
of values the kinds of equations that
the<00:02:17.280> spring<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> dashpot<00:02:17.970> obey<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.500> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the spring in the dashpot obey so the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.240 
the spring in the dashpot obey so the
spring<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.159> f<00:02:20.849> equals<00:02:21.209> K<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.569> X<00:02:21.689> so<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> force

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
spring is f equals K of X so the force

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
spring is f equals K of X so the force
is<00:02:23.549> proportional<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.569> amount<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
is proportional to the amount that the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.059 
is proportional to the amount that the
spring<00:02:25.829> stretches<00:02:26.099> X<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.680> F<00:02:29.010> 1

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
spring stretches X so here we have F 1

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.270 
spring stretches X so here we have F 1
is<00:02:29.730> KS<00:02:30.659> times<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.200> difference<00:02:31.530> between<00:02:31.680> Y<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
is KS times the difference between Y and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
is KS times the difference between Y and
X<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.239> look<00:02:33.420> over<00:02:33.659> on<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.900> left<00:02:34.079> hand

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
X so if you look over on the left hand

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830 
X so if you look over on the left hand
side<00:02:34.560> KS<00:02:35.489> when<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.879> at<00:02:36.030> rest<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:36.599> going

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
side KS when it's at rest is not going

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 
side KS when it's at rest is not going
to<00:02:36.900> be<00:02:37.019> having<00:02:37.200> any<00:02:37.500> force<00:02:37.799> at<00:02:38.099> all<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.269> that's

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to be having any force at all so that's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.660 
to be having any force at all so that's
been<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> difference<00:02:41.010> between<00:02:41.489> y

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
been the that's the difference between y

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
been the that's the difference between y
and<00:02:41.879> X<00:02:42.030> aren't<00:02:42.390> really<00:02:42.599> moving<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.379> as<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and X aren't really moving but as you

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.129 
and X aren't really moving but as you
make<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.920> value<00:02:44.099> bigger<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:45.659> force<00:02:45.959> is

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
make that value bigger the force is

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.960 
make that value bigger the force is
going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.379> be<00:02:46.470> slightly<00:02:46.829> larger<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.849> as

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
going to be slightly larger and so as

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.879 
going to be slightly larger and so as
you<00:02:48.060> stretch<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.450> apart<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.799> be

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
you stretch it apart it's going to be

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.180 
you stretch it apart it's going to be
trying<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.280> pull<00:02:50.519> m2<00:02:50.970> back<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.420> m1<00:02:51.780> or<00:02:51.989> pull<00:02:52.739> M<00:02:52.980> 1

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
trying to pull m2 back to m1 or pull M 1

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.949 
trying to pull m2 back to m1 or pull M 1
up<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.519> M<00:02:53.639> 2<00:02:53.879> depending<00:02:54.299> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> stiffness<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
up to M 2 depending on the stiffness of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.539 
up to M 2 depending on the stiffness of
the<00:02:55.079> other<00:02:55.200> spring<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.190> that's<00:02:56.370> why<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
the other spring so that's why the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.670 
the other spring so that's why the
forces<00:02:57.030> act<00:02:57.299> basically<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.230> towards<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
forces act basically in towards the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440 
forces act basically in towards the
middle<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.099> spring<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.180> make<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
middle of the spring so if you make the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
middle of the spring so if you make the
value<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.780> x<00:03:00.930> smaller<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.650> keep<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.280> y-value

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
value of x smaller and keep the y-value

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460 
value of x smaller and keep the y-value
the<00:03:02.939> same<00:03:03.239> then<00:03:03.870> you're<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.319> see<00:03:04.439> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
the same then you're going to see a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.009 
the same then you're going to see a
larger<00:03:04.920> force<00:03:05.129> exerted<00:03:05.569> so<00:03:06.569> let's<00:03:06.750> take<00:03:06.989> that

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
larger force exerted so let's take that

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.190 
larger force exerted so let's take that
and<00:03:07.379> substitute<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:09.959> now<00:03:10.139> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
and substitute it in we have now the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.990 
and substitute it in we have now the
damper<00:03:10.680> or<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.889> dashpot<00:03:11.129> so<00:03:11.609> remember<00:03:11.970> that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
damper or the dashpot so remember that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.110 
damper or the dashpot so remember that
these<00:03:12.620> where<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.769> force<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.310> proportional<00:03:14.519> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
these where the force is proportional to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.869 
these where the force is proportional to
the<00:03:15.389> rate<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.870> change<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.739> distance<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
the rate of change of distance so a

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.330 
the rate of change of distance so a
dashpot<00:03:18.319> doesn't<00:03:19.319> have<00:03:19.560> any<00:03:19.709> force<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.190> it's

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
dashpot doesn't have any force when it's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.939 
dashpot doesn't have any force when it's
not<00:03:20.459> moving<00:03:20.639> but<00:03:21.030> when<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.299> does<00:03:21.510> move<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.650> see

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
not moving but when it does move you see

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.500 
not moving but when it does move you see
that<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> force<00:03:23.639> is<00:03:23.819> proportional<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.419> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that the force is proportional to the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.240 
that the force is proportional to the
velocity<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.790> here<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.030> have<00:03:27.150> f2<00:03:27.599> is<00:03:27.840> B<00:03:28.620> times<00:03:28.949> y

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
velocity so here we have f2 is B times y

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.520 
velocity so here we have f2 is B times y
dot<00:03:29.489> minus<00:03:29.849> X<00:03:30.030> dot<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.989> what's<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.349> difference

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
dot minus X dot so what's the difference

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.530 
dot minus X dot so what's the difference
in<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.859> rates<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:32.250> velocities<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:33.000> Lion<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
in the rates of velocities of Lion of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.599 
in the rates of velocities of Lion of
the<00:03:33.629> values<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.440> masses<00:03:34.769> at<00:03:34.919> Y<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.250> X<00:03:35.370> and

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the values of the masses at Y and X and

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.180 
the values of the masses at Y and X and
F<00:03:36.480> 3<00:03:36.780> because<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.230> another<00:03:37.440> spring<00:03:37.799> here<00:03:38.069> we

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
F 3 because it's another spring here we

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.589 
F 3 because it's another spring here we
take<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> difference<00:03:38.819> between<00:03:39.090> X<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
take the difference between X and the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.449 
take the difference between X and the
road<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.409> if<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.560> think<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.919> road<00:03:41.099> is<00:03:41.250> 0

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
road so if we think of the road is 0

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.509 
road so if we think of the road is 0
then<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.819> just<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:42.299> K<00:03:42.629> W<00:03:42.959> times<00:03:43.109> X<00:03:43.379> so<00:03:44.370> with

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
then we just have K W times X so with

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.420 
then we just have K W times X so with
these<00:03:44.639> three<00:03:44.970> values<00:03:45.510> now<00:03:46.290> we<00:03:46.319> can<00:03:46.829> write<00:03:47.069> that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
these three values now we can write that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.110 
these three values now we can write that
m1<00:03:47.699> x1<00:03:48.389> double<00:03:48.810> dot<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.169> F<00:03:49.650> 1<00:03:49.949> plus<00:03:50.099> F<00:03:50.400> 2<00:03:50.430> minus<00:03:50.639> F

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
m1 x1 double dot is F 1 plus F 2 minus F

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.390 
m1 x1 double dot is F 1 plus F 2 minus F
3<00:03:51.449> and<00:03:51.659> likewise<00:03:52.699> m2<00:03:53.699> x2<00:03:54.389> double<00:03:54.840> dot<00:03:55.129> is<00:03:56.129> going

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
3 and likewise m2 x2 double dot is going

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.809 
3 and likewise m2 x2 double dot is going
to<00:03:56.459> be<00:03:56.549> equal<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.849> minus<00:03:57.209> F<00:03:57.389> 1<00:03:57.599> minus<00:03:57.870> F<00:03:58.530> 2<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.699> we

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
to be equal to minus F 1 minus F 2 so we

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.550 
to be equal to minus F 1 minus F 2 so we
can<00:03:59.849> substitute<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.599> those<00:04:00.900> values<00:04:01.319> for<00:04:01.470> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
can substitute in those values for the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.339 
can substitute in those values for the
actual<00:04:01.859> forces<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.720> get<00:04:03.840> something<00:04:04.169> that's

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
actual forces to get something that's

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.110 
actual forces to get something that's
going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.650> be<00:04:04.799> our<00:04:05.010> equations<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.669> motion<00:04:05.970> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
going to be our equations of motion so

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.430 
going to be our equations of motion so
for<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.359> first<00:04:06.510> value<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.139> should<00:04:07.290> see

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
for the first value you should see

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
for the first value you should see
something<00:04:07.739> like<00:04:07.829> this<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.629> second

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
something like this and for the second

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.199 
something like this and for the second
value<00:04:10.109> here<00:04:10.799> so<00:04:11.579> with<00:04:11.760> these<00:04:11.909> as<00:04:12.090> our

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
value here so with these as our

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.839 
value here so with these as our
equations<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.870> motion<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:14.489> have<00:04:14.699> the

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
equations of motion we now have the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.219 
equations of motion we now have the
ability<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.239> describe<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.870> rate<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.199> change

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
ability to describe the rate of change

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.849 
ability to describe the rate of change
of<00:04:16.919> how<00:04:17.579> x1<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.389> x2<00:04:18.690> double<00:04:19.169> dot<00:04:19.199> are<00:04:19.560> going<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
of how x1 and x2 double dot are going to

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.399 
of how x1 and x2 double dot are going to
be<00:04:19.949> changing<00:04:20.430> based<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.849> input<00:04:21.269> values<00:04:21.630> or<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
be changing based on input values or the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.400 
be changing based on input values or the
existing<00:04:22.830> state<00:04:23.039> values
