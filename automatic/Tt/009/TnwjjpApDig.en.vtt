whenever I press this button a whole
bunch<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> fireworks<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> pop<00:00:26.160> out

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
bunch of fireworks are going to pop out

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.689 
bunch of fireworks are going to pop out
and<00:00:26.630> we'll<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:27.990> them<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.800> let<00:00:29.130> me<00:00:29.250> turn

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and we'll get to see them so let me turn

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.380 
and we'll get to see them so let me turn
off<00:00:29.760> these<00:00:30.060> lights<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:31.790> had<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> problem<00:00:33.149> with

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
off these lights I had a problem with

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.360 
off these lights I had a problem with
these<00:00:33.510> earlier<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.140> they<00:00:34.290> caused<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.890> bud

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
these earlier because they caused a bud

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
these earlier because they caused a bud
and<00:00:35.610> made<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> dispensers<00:00:36.960> pulse<00:00:37.200> twice<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.829> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and made the dispensers pulse twice so I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
and made the dispensers pulse twice so I
have<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> turn<00:00:38.340> them<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.610> alright<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.809> let's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
have to turn them off alright so let's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:57.440 
have to turn them off alright so let's
do<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.430 

alright<00:00:58.450> guys<00:00:58.629> now<00:00:58.660> I'm<00:00:59.020> going<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.290> show<00:00:59.320> you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
alright guys now I'm going to show you

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.900 
alright guys now I'm going to show you
how<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.649> build<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.460> you're<00:01:00.579> going<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.760> need

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
how to build it so you're going to need

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.090 
how to build it so you're going to need
these<00:01:01.059> materials<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.829> going<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.040> be

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
these materials and it's going to be

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.890 
these materials and it's going to be
much<00:01:03.370> more<00:01:03.400> compact<00:01:03.820> than<00:01:03.970> this<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.390> just<00:01:04.629> built

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
much more compact than this I just built

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.440 
much more compact than this I just built
this<00:01:05.110> for<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> show<00:01:05.860> I<00:01:05.890> guess<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.520> don't<00:01:06.729> know<00:01:06.850> it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
this for a show I guess I don't know it

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.359 
this for a show I guess I don't know it
was<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> prototype<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.619> you'll<00:01:09.100> need<00:01:09.250> these

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
was a prototype so you'll need these

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.200 
was a prototype so you'll need these
materials<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:12.130> won't<00:01:12.340> need<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:12.970> mini

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
materials and you won't need this mini

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.090 
materials and you won't need this mini
Rockets<00:01:14.159> these<00:01:15.159> will<00:01:15.700> be<00:01:15.850> our<00:01:16.259> input<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.470> then

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
Rockets these will be our input and then

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.890 
Rockets these will be our input and then
you<00:01:18.220> can<00:01:18.369> have<00:01:18.550> a<00:01:18.610> diamond<00:01:19.060> pick<00:01:19.270> if<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.479> want

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
you can have a diamond pick if you want

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.380 
you can have a diamond pick if you want
it<00:01:20.290> helps<00:01:20.590> out<00:01:20.740> if<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.100> make<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> mistake<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
what you want to do is take two

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.790 
what you want to do is take two
dispensers<00:01:25.390> place<00:01:26.259> them<00:01:26.440> like<00:01:26.619> this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
dispensers place them like this

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.130 
dispensers place them like this
alongside<00:01:27.759> each<00:01:28.060> other<00:01:28.300> two<00:01:28.869> blocks

top and there you have it now this is
the<00:01:55.300> main<00:01:55.539> circuit<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.460> put<00:01:57.790> your

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the main circuit and you just put your

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.179 
the main circuit and you just put your
input<00:01:58.420> whatever<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.930> may<00:01:59.049> be<00:01:59.079> mine<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.950> this

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
input whatever that may be mine is this

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.399 
input whatever that may be mine is this
and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.860> want<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:04.450> add<00:02:04.720> your<00:02:04.960> fireworks

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
and then you want to add your fireworks

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.710 
and then you want to add your fireworks
now<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> haven't<00:02:06.880> really<00:02:07.150> changed<00:02:07.450> these

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
now I haven't really changed these

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.350 
now I haven't really changed these
fireworks<00:02:08.229> at<00:02:08.470> all<00:02:08.619> but<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.820> is<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.000> an

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
fireworks at all but this is just an

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.289 
fireworks at all but this is just an
example<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.320> it's<00:02:11.470> going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.769> look<00:02:11.890> like

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
example of what it's going to look like

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.900 
example of what it's going to look like
so<00:02:13.299> whenever<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.660> start<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.290> circuits<00:02:15.250> your

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so whenever you start the circuits your

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.170 
so whenever you start the circuits your
fireworks<00:02:16.329> are<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.810> fire<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:18.180> yours

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
fireworks are going to fire and yours

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.150 
fireworks are going to fire and yours
will<00:02:19.420> look<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.930> lot<00:02:20.170> better<00:02:20.530> than<00:02:20.829> this<00:02:20.950> because

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
will look a lot better than this because

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.240 
will look a lot better than this because
I<00:02:21.690> haven't<00:02:22.690> done<00:02:22.989> anything<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.500> mind<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.920> yeah

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
I haven't done anything to mind so yeah

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.270 
I haven't done anything to mind so yeah
that's<00:02:24.850> how<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.120> works<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:26.010> hope<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.130> guys

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that's how it works and hope you guys

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.009 
that's how it works and hope you guys
