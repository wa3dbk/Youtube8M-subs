know I guess actual series die aka the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.650 
know I guess actual series die aka the
ether<00:00:33.140> or<00:00:33.170> whatever<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.940> actual<00:00:35.090> reason

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
ether or whatever and the actual reason

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.119 
ether or whatever and the actual reason
behind<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.109> is<00:00:36.460> because<00:00:37.460> well<00:00:38.030> um<00:00:39.129> simply

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129

just kind of like the start of a new i

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.100

guess like you know starting new so um
yeah<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.320> thinking<00:02:28.710> about<00:02:28.920> doing<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.490> I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
yeah I'm thinking about doing that I

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
yeah I'm thinking about doing that I
mean<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.810> assume<00:02:31.230> that's<00:02:31.530> our<00:02:31.709> best<00:02:31.860> bet

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
mean I would assume that's our best bet

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
mean I would assume that's our best bet
because<00:02:32.490> then<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.360> know<00:02:33.420> technically

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
because then I can you know technically

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
because then I can you know technically
start<00:02:33.959> over<00:02:34.080> blah<00:02:34.260> blah<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.950> they<00:02:35.070> try<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
start over blah blah and they try to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.310 
start over blah blah and they try to
refrain<00:02:35.640> from<00:02:35.670> using<00:02:35.970> mods<00:02:36.330> whatever<00:02:36.780> but

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
refrain from using mods whatever but

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.170 
refrain from using mods whatever but
obviously<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> series<00:02:38.700> two<00:02:38.970> would

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
obviously one of the series two would

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.760 
obviously one of the series two would
not<00:02:39.390> start<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> while<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.500> want<00:02:40.680> to

youtubers<00:03:49.890> do<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.459> or<00:03:50.700> they<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.030> know

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
like different series I guess and so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.009 
like different series I guess and so
it'd<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.940> same<00:03:53.970> except<00:03:54.600> they'd<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:54.989> a

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
it'd be the same except they'd just be a

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.030 
it'd be the same except they'd just be a
different<00:03:55.260> series<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.799> kinda<00:03:55.980> like

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
different series and it's kinda like

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.500 
different series and it's kinda like
starting<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> kinda<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> TV<00:03:56.940> show<00:03:57.239> where

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
starting you kinda like a TV show where

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.900 
starting you kinda like a TV show where
there's<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.170> know<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.549> decent<00:03:59.549> amount<00:03:59.760> of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
there's you know a decent amount of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.180 
there's you know a decent amount of
changes<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.570> it's<00:04:01.440> still<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.709> same<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.070> a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
changes but it's still the same it's a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.530 
changes but it's still the same it's a
little<00:04:02.340> same<00:04:02.459> show<00:04:02.670> but<00:04:03.000> there's<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.209> you

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
know a lot of changes so it would

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.289
