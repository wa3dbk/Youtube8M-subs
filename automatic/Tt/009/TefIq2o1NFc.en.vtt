00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
range this lands in a pretty good spot

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.599 
range this lands in a pretty good spot
at<00:01:54.399> 1200<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.939> think<00:01:56.899> that<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.770> not<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.490> know

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
at 1200 I think that it's not you know

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.130 
at 1200 I think that it's not you know
it's<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.780> performs<00:02:00.409> very<00:02:01.130> very<00:02:01.490> well<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:02.689> its

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
it's it performs very very well for its

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.899 
it's it performs very very well for its
price<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.590> know<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.740> say<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:07.219> a<00:02:07.280> lot<00:02:07.340> but<00:02:07.729> in

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
price so I know I say that a lot but in

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.419 
price so I know I say that a lot but in
this<00:02:08.030> case<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.630> 1200<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:09.950> means<00:02:10.220> that

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
this case the 1200 you know means that

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.220 
this case the 1200 you know means that
expectations<00:02:10.970> are<00:02:11.060> much<00:02:11.240> higher<00:02:11.450> you're

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
expectations are much higher you're

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.050 
expectations are much higher you're
looking<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.770> something<00:02:13.010> where<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> response

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
looking for something where the response

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.479 
looking for something where the response
has<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.270> be<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.780> linear<00:02:15.050> very<00:02:15.319> true<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.190> sound

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
has to be very linear very true to sound

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.210 
has to be very linear very true to sound
and<00:02:16.819> still<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.720> really<00:02:17.989> fun<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.920> think

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
and still be really fun and I think

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.529 
comfort for planar magnetic top tier
flagship<00:04:45.449> headphone<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:46.020> really<00:04:47.419> really<00:04:48.419> is

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
flagship headphone it really really is

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.450 
flagship headphone it really really is
comfortable<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.470> lighter<00:04:49.889> than<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.280> lot<00:04:50.430> of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
comfortable it's lighter than a lot of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.400 
comfortable it's lighter than a lot of
the<00:04:50.639> other<00:04:50.789> headphones<00:04:51.000> out<00:04:51.449> there<00:04:51.720> in<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
the other headphones out there in the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.460 
the other headphones out there in the
same<00:04:52.620> arena<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.370> also<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.720> caliper<00:04:55.229> pressure

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
same arena and also the caliper pressure

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.170 
same arena and also the caliper pressure
seems<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:55.919> about<00:04:56.009> perfect<00:04:56.550> for<00:04:56.699> my<00:04:56.850> head<00:04:57.030> at

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
seems just about perfect for my head at

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.990 
seems just about perfect for my head at
least<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:58.110> amount<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.639> tension<00:04:59.639> that's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
least so the amount of tension that's

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.990 
least so the amount of tension that's
used<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.479> keep<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.840> on<00:05:01.050> your<00:05:01.320> head<00:05:01.590> isn't<00:05:02.490> like

crushing your melon or too loose that it

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.550 
crushing your melon or too loose that it
falls<00:05:05.639> off<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.060> fact<00:05:06.360> compared<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.199> a<00:05:07.289> lot<00:05:07.440> of

falls off in fact compared to a lot of

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.680 
falls off in fact compared to a lot of

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
more like a regular pair of headphones

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260 
more like a regular pair of headphones
without<00:05:13.740> having<00:05:14.010> like<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.310> huge<00:05:14.580> audiophile

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
without having like that huge audiophile

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.920 
without having like that huge audiophile
kind<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.600> weight<00:05:15.780> coming<00:05:16.020> down<00:05:16.199> so<00:05:17.270> big<00:05:18.270> marks

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
kind of weight coming down so big marks

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.140 
kind of weight coming down so big marks
big<00:05:19.350> marks<00:05:19.740> for<00:05:19.889> oppo<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.490> regard<00:05:20.820> the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
big marks for oppo in that regard the

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.379 
big marks for oppo in that regard the
driver<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.350> actually<00:05:22.740> proprietary<00:05:23.550> they're

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
driver is actually proprietary they're

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.610 
driver is actually proprietary they're
calling<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.900> seven<00:05:25.350> layer<00:05:25.560> unique<00:05:26.550> design

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
calling it a seven layer unique design

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.779 
calling it a seven layer unique design
that's<00:05:28.620> specific<00:05:29.099> to<00:05:29.220> them<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.810> know<00:05:31.169> I

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
that's specific to them so you know I

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.920 
that's specific to them so you know I
think<00:05:32.789> they<00:05:32.910> put<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.090> time<00:05:33.360> and<00:05:33.389> energy<00:05:33.840> and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
think they put the time and energy and

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.020 
think they put the time and energy and
R&amp;D<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.500> really<00:05:34.800> push<00:05:35.009> out<00:05:35.160> something<00:05:35.520> special

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
R&amp;D to really push out something special

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.180 
R&amp;D to really push out something special
the<00:05:36.150> first<00:05:36.360> time<00:05:36.630> around<00:05:36.860> excellent<00:05:37.860> that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
the first time around excellent that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.029 
the first time around excellent that
worked<00:05:38.430> there<00:05:39.260> one<00:05:40.260> last<00:05:40.440> thing<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.740> just<00:05:40.770> like

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
worked there one last thing I just like

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.070 
worked there one last thing I just like
to<00:05:41.190> comment<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.729> sound<00:05:42.000> is<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.539> the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
to comment on the sound is this the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.529 
to comment on the sound is this the
staging<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:44.360> focused<00:05:46.099> articulation<00:05:47.099> of

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
staging the focused articulation of

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.550 
staging the focused articulation of
individual<00:05:48.539> instruments<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.139> instrument

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
individual instruments so the instrument

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.980 
individual instruments so the instrument
separation<00:05:50.220> combined<00:05:50.970> with<00:05:51.210> where<00:05:51.659> the<00:05:51.780> kind

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
separation combined with where the kind

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.779 
separation combined with where the kind
of<00:05:52.020> land<00:05:52.229> and<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.500> soundscape<00:05:52.889> is<00:05:53.039> very<00:05:53.400> sharp

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
of land and the soundscape is very sharp

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.600 
of land and the soundscape is very sharp
it's<00:05:54.270> it's<00:05:54.690> almost<00:05:55.050> like<00:05:55.620> holographic<00:05:56.430> where

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
it's it's almost like holographic where

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.149 
it's it's almost like holographic where
it<00:05:56.789> sits<00:05:57.030> outside<00:05:57.270> your<00:05:57.810> head<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.229> very<00:05:58.830> very

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
it sits outside your head a very very

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.219 
it sits outside your head a very very
good<00:05:59.340> way<00:05:59.520> it's<00:06:00.270> one<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.080> most

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
good way it's one of the most

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.020 
good way it's one of the most
interesting<00:06:01.620> yet<00:06:01.979> arbitrary<00:06:02.580> kind<00:06:02.909> of

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
interesting yet arbitrary kind of

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.159 
interesting yet arbitrary kind of
characteristics<00:06:03.750> of<00:06:03.870> listening<00:06:04.139> the

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
characteristics of listening the

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.320 
characteristics of listening the
headphones<00:06:04.560> is<00:06:04.770> how<00:06:05.430> do<00:06:05.490> we<00:06:05.610> get<00:06:05.820> that<00:06:06.030> sound

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
headphones is how do we get that sound

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330 
headphones is how do we get that sound
out<00:06:06.599> of<00:06:06.930> our<00:06:07.080> head<00:06:07.320> and<00:06:07.560> more<00:06:07.949> like<00:06:08.130> we're

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
out of our head and more like we're

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.439 
out of our head and more like we're
sitting<00:06:08.610> there<00:06:08.639> listening<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.090> a<00:06:09.180> pair<00:06:09.419> of

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
sitting there listening to a pair of

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.409 
sitting there listening to a pair of
speakers<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:10.400> think<00:06:11.400> through<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.669> treble<00:06:12.090> the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
speakers I think through the treble the

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.909 
speakers I think through the treble the
accuracy<00:06:12.930> and<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.169> lot<00:06:13.349> of<00:06:13.440> other<00:06:13.590> factors

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
accuracy and a lot of other factors

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.159 
accuracy and a lot of other factors
these<00:06:14.849> headphones<00:06:15.060> do<00:06:15.360> that<00:06:15.510> very<00:06:15.720> very<00:06:15.900> well

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
these headphones do that very very well

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.560 
these headphones do that very very well
it's<00:06:16.380> very<00:06:16.889> nice<00:06:17.460> characteristic<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.389> have

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
it's very nice characteristic to have

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.649 
it's very nice characteristic to have
with<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.289> pair<00:06:19.470> of<00:06:19.560> headphones<00:06:19.740> and<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:21.360> think

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
with the pair of headphones and I think

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.089 
with the pair of headphones and I think
it<00:06:21.720> achieves<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.110> that<00:06:22.560> quality<00:06:22.889> very

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
it achieves that that quality very

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:23.920 
it achieves that that quality very
nicely

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
nicely

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.379 
nicely
so<00:06:24.979> really<00:06:25.979> the<00:06:26.220> highlights<00:06:26.639> of<00:06:26.789> this<00:06:26.940> this
