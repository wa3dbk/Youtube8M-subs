00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.130 
I found the easiest way to figure out
where<00:02:43.880> somebody<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.810> launch<00:02:45.019> a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
where somebody is it just to launch a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900 
where somebody is it just to launch a
few<00:02:45.350> rounds<00:02:45.530> at<00:02:45.829> them<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.190> then<00:02:46.310> zoom<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.760> on

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
few rounds at them and then zoom in on

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.520 
few rounds at them and then zoom in on
them<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.720> are<00:02:47.840> several<00:02:48.049> different

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
them there are several different

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
them there are several different
environments<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.610> can<00:02:49.820> play<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.120> and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
environments that you can play on and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:59.119 
environments that you can play on and
global<00:02:51.110> leaderboards

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:09.740

direct hit enemies are destroyed for

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
direct hit enemies are destroyed for
extra<00:03:25.340> points<00:03:25.550> there's<00:03:25.910> also<00:03:26.120> some<00:03:26.510> planes

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
extra points there's also some planes

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.990 
extra points there's also some planes
and<00:03:27.200> extra<00:03:27.560> targets<00:03:28.130> laying<00:03:28.430> around<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
screen that you can blow up and it's a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.490 
screen that you can blow up and it's a
nice<00:03:31.970> game<00:03:32.360> for<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.660> ipod<00:03:33.050> because<00:03:33.380> it

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
nice game for the ipod because it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.110 
nice game for the ipod because it
doesn't<00:03:33.739> rely<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.459> moving<00:03:34.940> your

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
doesn't rely on you moving your

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.410 
doesn't rely on you moving your
character<00:03:35.959> around<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.880> many<00:03:37.880> games<00:03:38.180> fall

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
character around and many games fall

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.000 
character around and many games fall
flat<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:38.780> their<00:03:38.870> face<00:03:39.200> when<00:03:39.230> they<00:03:39.500> try<00:03:39.769> that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
flat on their face when they try that

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.830 
flat on their face when they try that
not<00:03:40.220> not<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:40.670> one<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.060> just<00:03:41.510> relies<00:03:41.810> on

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
not not this one because just relies on

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080 
not not this one because just relies on
you<00:03:42.170> being<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.440> stationary<00:03:42.950> target<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.550> aiming

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
you being a stationary target and aiming

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.110 
you being a stationary target and aiming
and<00:03:44.450> they<00:03:45.200> make<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.560> fun<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.160> don't<00:03:46.880> know<00:03:46.970> that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and they make it fun I don't know that

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.210 
and they make it fun I don't know that
the<00:03:47.239> first<00:03:47.569> person<00:03:48.110> shooter<00:03:48.440> genre<00:03:48.470> comes

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the first person shooter genre comes

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.640 
the first person shooter genre comes
over<00:03:49.489> to<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.730> ipod<00:03:50.090> well<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.600> this<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:50.989> nice

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
over to the ipod well so this is a nice

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530 
over to the ipod well so this is a nice
break<00:03:52.040> from<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.549> while<00:03:52.760> still<00:03:53.000> keeping<00:03:53.150> some

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
break from that while still keeping some

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.870 
break from that while still keeping some
of<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.780> same<00:03:54.019> elements<00:03:54.530> namely<00:03:55.100> blowing<00:03:55.730> your

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
of the same elements namely blowing your

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.390 
of the same elements namely blowing your
enemies<00:03:56.180> away<00:03:56.450> without<00:03:56.750> mercy<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.440> laughing

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
enemies away without mercy and laughing

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:11.860 
enemies away without mercy and laughing
at<00:03:58.580> them<00:04:01.090> direct<00:04:02.090> hit<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:10.569> should<00:04:11.569> also<00:04:11.720> mention

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
at them direct hit I should also mention

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.530 
at them direct hit I should also mention
that<00:04:12.200> gameplay<00:04:12.830> can<00:04:13.099> be<00:04:13.220> either<00:04:13.459> real<00:04:13.880> time<00:04:14.209> or

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
that gameplay can be either real time or

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.890 
that gameplay can be either real time or
turn-based<00:04:15.349> I<00:04:15.860> found<00:04:16.820> real<00:04:17.150> time<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.600> be<00:04:17.720> more

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
turn-based I found real time to be more

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900 
turn-based I found real time to be more
fun<00:04:18.140> but<00:04:18.320> turn-based<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.190> probably<00:04:19.640> better

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
fun but turn-based is probably better

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.440 
fun but turn-based is probably better
