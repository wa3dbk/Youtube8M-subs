00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.980
 This theme is 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.129
 Increase your reflection speed during the match. 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.379
 I would like to introduce important consciousness 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.880
 The contents of this time are often shaken around in the game, for example 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
 Those who feel that there are many are shaken 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.699
 I do my best to jump and take a ball, but soon afterwards 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.849
 Those who have experiences like being shot through 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.050
 Even if you are playing a game after all that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.820
 It is shot through immediately and does not continue rally at all 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.800
 For those who say that it will end 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.989
 What you want to see is the feature of those people 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.030
 It means that the reflection speed is slow 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 Because the reflection speed is slow, I can not reach the next ball 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.020
 There are a lot of things that say there are no legs 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.949
 That there is such a feature 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:10.520
 I understand 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.810
 During the game against the champ and ball 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.850
 If it is possible to reflect that kind of thing 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.600
 I think it will be decreasing little by little 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.040
 So increase the reflection speed during the game 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.310
 I would like to introduce some of the really important awareness 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 To see that consciousness and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.650
 Consciousness to do the thing of doing back simultaneously 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 Please try this and what it means 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.640
 In other words, people with slow reflexes during the game 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.500
 It is a feature It is after hitting as a feature 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.750
 There's one thing I've seen all the time 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.990
 What will I do after I hit it, or what will the other party do? 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.140
 I see it while I hit 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.790
 I'll see it like this, so if I'll do it next time 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 A good person who can not react anymore 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.110
 I'm going to see if I can get in and out 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.510
 I'm already back here while watching 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.400
 So the next ball comes out with another foot 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.010
 It will be fine in practice 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.180
 Those who say they can move with good feeling but can not play in the game 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.310
 In particular, there are many people who have this tendency. 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.930
 It means that you go back while looking so as not to look over 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 Please be conscious of it 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.710
 Those who are conscious but can not do it 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.420
 Who needs this awareness is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.090
 I think there are so many, please try to be conscious 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.560
 This is not only during the game 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.651
 The same is true during practice Footwork practice 

00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.410
 When I'm doing or practice my third game 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.070
 Even when practicing a little closer to practice 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.790
 While watching the movement of the ball constantly watching the movement of the other party 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.960
 Be sure to hit the back and then come back anywhere 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.150
 I'm preparing to move 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.569
 It will be very important by all means everyone 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.819
 Thank you for trying it
