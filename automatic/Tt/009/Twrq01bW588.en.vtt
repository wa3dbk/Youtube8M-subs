00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.720
 this dessert is a dessert that is a 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.390
 battle horse we are going to make a 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.189
 chocotorta me in this case I will give 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.949
 one lap truth walked a 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.919
 little eat the amount of chocolate in 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.189
 this medical cake I love then what 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.019
 I thought with a recipe for vanilla vos 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.529
 you can do it with 2 the truth remains 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.260
 preparation is the same and notice that 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.670
 accept both options and the other I'm going 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.149
 to do is directly what I'm going to do 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.129
 in a March it seems to me like more copado 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.760
 It stands out more and is another way to avoid 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.910
 have that rigidity of and if I do not have a 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.019
 square plate or I can not do it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.850
 directly in a glass you can do it 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.339
 You can make a drink in a jar 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.640
 we have this glass what seems like that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.610
 what am I going to develop 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.920
 the base of cookies to cookies 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.140
 it is also we have to add a filling 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.199
 in this case the filling is going to be a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.199
 cream cheese mix with dulce de leche 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 how much is good that you're going to 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.260
 handle enjoy at the time of when 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.910
 you want to fill the glass so I what 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.400
 I'm going to do is first prepare this 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.640
 homemade cream is full of cake 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.050
 what I'm going to put is two tablespoons of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.010
 cream cheese cream cheese anyone 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.630
 do not do not look for any in particular the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.420
 what you like most and one that have been the most 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 other than not being 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 we put the base of cream cheese and sweet 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.350
 of milk the same you can use if you want 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.049
 a sports milk candy in this case 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.320
 I use a common one like that until it 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.760
 integrate 2 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.300
 the ingredients 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.040
 it's something very simple you do not have to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.490
 add more nothing 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.010
 if you want if you want to experience 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.960
 you can add a little bit of liquor is not going 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.440
 the rest is going to be more liquid 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.930
 preparation but it's already 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.330
 this is the stuffing you should do a lot with 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.490
 cake 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.430
 as we continue with the cookie that goes to 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.560
 be the base we are going to have to soak 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.740
 so that it does not remain that way of sect I in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.270
 this case the charge is to soak it in coffee 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.090
 ihcafÃ© that you prepare of filter left over 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.640
 make coffee before throwing it good 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.540
 put in a brown and direct container 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 well of leaves the song and so this as 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.970
 idea look at the cookie look there is 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.640
 one round trip because if you do not 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.230
 active disarm what we do not want is 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.349
 that goes back and forth 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.940
 and we break the progress as many times and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.159
 is about to be good look a little 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.799
 how is the container where are you going to 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.269
 place the dessert at the end but I in 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.349
 this case already with three cookies 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.230
 tested alone disarms people 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.850
 immediately the recipe absorbs the coffee and 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.240
 disarm you help with a spoon 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.380
 so you can push and flatten a little more 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.990
 to foresee actions that more compact 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.390
 spoon we play and we have the first 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.170
 layer look what 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.959
 Turns twiter and cooking honestly is a 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.350
 proof of any error have the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.080
 first potato we go with the filling there 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.860
 a layer of filling and we do again 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.840
 the same 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.060
 we repeat all the times of the height 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.160
 of the cup that you want this is a 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.120
 dessert that you can do and really 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.790
 it may surprise you 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.750
 first because look what is not 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.540
 mix three things and nothing else and turn off it 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.720
 It will surprise you to invite them to eat and the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.989
 another is something economic this is going to 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.690
 leave 30% of what you get a kilo 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.260
 on the side minus again we will talk a 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.330
 little bit and we go another spoonful more 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.070
 of the filling and what I'm going to do now 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.310
 to give it one more lap I'm going to do 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.590
 a layer of chocolate we mix 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.250
 ingredients or you experience the mixture 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.570
 I did not notice that my idea I say this you want 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.730
 do it with another cookie of some 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.940
 cereal cookies that come with 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.200
 chocolate chips that are very rich 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.010
 also the same 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.110
 Soak a little for what 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.780
 and then it becomes softer when you 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.670
 eat so that a piece of 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.730
 cookies is not crispy is a dessert 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.980
 soft look is to soak 23 turns 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.860
 loans 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.020
 coffee that you always have coffee and if 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.780
 do not agree, you do not want to do it with 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.940
 coffee makes with a chocolate only with 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.700
 milk you do not want said we are putting 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.650
 a liquor towards the drunk is another 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.500
 option the truth what options there is a 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.360
 I can think of a lot in this voice 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.110
 experience wife this you are going to give 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.140
 cold two hours of cold and you're going to be 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.280
 in the dessert made this is a little horse 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.389
 of vacancy that never fails 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 and only one white and I was measuring and if 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.070
 I enter not this is more practical for 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.350
 back in the era is occupied less place what 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.410
 you can accommodate as you want always 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.540
 try to take advantage of everything no more as in 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.190
 the TV that is shot more than half 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.200
 try to have one or another 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.690
 utensil that helps you to take advantage of all 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.669
 the preparation is something that I do not have 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.590
 which is prolixity I really go 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.110
 learning with the passage of time 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.000
 improve visual of what 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.270
 prepared but not sincerely not created 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.820
 the game notice that here you have no margin 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.370
 of error you have already done what 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.440
 you can do to the end that the 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.570
 wood moisture soft zone 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.770
 is to break up a little bit of 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.770
 cookie so dry without soaking and not 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.800
