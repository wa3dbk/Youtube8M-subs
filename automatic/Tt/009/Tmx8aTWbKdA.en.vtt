times<00:02:09.380> that's<00:02:10.369> something<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:10.850> could<00:02:11.000> really

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
times that's something that could really

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.550 
times that's something that could really
be<00:02:11.450> important<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.050> you're<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> sports

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
focal length of your lens so you've had

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that it came with it's a decent lens but

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.390 
that it came with it's a decent lens but
you're<00:02:23.959> probably<00:02:24.170> thinking<00:02:24.410> why<00:02:25.010> are<00:02:25.220> there

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
you're probably thinking why are there

you're probably thinking why are there
all<00:02:25.519> these<00:02:25.670> other<00:02:25.819> choices<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.360> lens<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.930> what

all these other choices of lens and what

all these other choices of lens and what

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
kind of one might you want to change to

one<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.110> first<00:02:30.349> things<00:02:30.620> we're<00:02:30.769> going<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
one of the first things we're going to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.440 
one of the first things we're going to
think<00:02:31.130> about<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.519> its<00:02:31.670> focal<00:02:32.150> length<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
think about is its focal length the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.850 
think about is its focal length the
focal<00:02:32.900> length<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.260> lens<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.650> what

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
focal length of a lens is what

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.100 
focal length of a lens is what
determines<00:02:34.310> its<00:02:34.880> its<00:02:35.150> magnification<00:02:35.959> how

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
determines its its magnification how

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.589 
determines its its magnification how
close<00:02:36.410> things<00:02:36.620> appear<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.160> also<00:02:37.760> its<00:02:38.180> angle

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
close things appear and also its angle

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.539 
close things appear and also its angle
of<00:02:38.690> view<00:02:38.930> how<00:02:39.230> much<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.709> scene<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.160> see

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
of view how much of the scene we can see

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.880 
of view how much of the scene we can see
if<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.360> work<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:42.230> short<00:02:42.440> focal

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
if we work with a really short focal

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.190 
if we work with a really short focal
length<00:02:43.069> like<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.730> 14<00:02:44.269> millimeter<00:02:44.720> lens<00:02:44.989> we

you take a zoom like this 24 to 105 zoom
it<00:03:07.970> lets<00:03:08.150> us<00:03:08.299> vary<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.810> focal<00:03:09.170> length<00:03:09.200> that's

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
it lets us vary the focal length that's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.720 
it lets us vary the focal length that's
what<00:03:09.709> we're<00:03:09.829> doing<00:03:10.130> when<00:03:10.250> we're<00:03:10.370> zooming

what we're doing when we're zooming

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.130 
what we're doing when we're zooming
we're<00:03:10.880> actually<00:03:11.150> varying<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> focal<00:03:12.110> length

we're actually varying the focal length
and<00:03:12.470> that's<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.160> gives<00:03:13.340> us<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.670> effect<00:03:14.000> of

and that's what gives us that effect of

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.330 
and that's what gives us that effect of
changing<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.930> angle<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.380> view<00:03:15.590> changing<00:03:16.250> how

about speed in relation to lenses what

about speed in relation to lenses what

in the other thing we need to consider

if we're close up with a wide-angle lens
that's<00:04:26.659> probably<00:04:26.960> best

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
that's probably best

that's probably best

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
try to put some images so Jenny what

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.310 
try to put some images so Jenny what
kind<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.510> images<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.020> got<00:04:30.200> to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
kind of images have you got to

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.140

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
longest the 200 mil okay that's quite a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.140 
longest the 200 mil okay that's quite a
dramatic<00:04:54.830> effect<00:04:55.340> and<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.550> chose<00:04:55.790> that<00:04:55.820> again

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
dramatic effect and you chose that again

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.760 
dramatic effect and you chose that again
really<00:04:56.360> far<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:56.690> we<00:04:56.780> get<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> real<00:04:57.290> sense<00:04:57.620> of

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
really far so we get a real sense of

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.400 
really far so we get a real sense of
what's<00:04:57.920> happening<00:04:58.310> here<00:05:01.840> we<00:05:02.840> can<00:05:03.020> see<00:05:03.200> can't

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
what's happening here we can see can't

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.840 
what's happening here we can see can't
be<00:05:03.500> there<00:05:03.620> as<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.920> lens<00:05:04.130> gets<00:05:04.400> longer<00:05:04.760> the

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
be there as the lens gets longer the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.250 
be there as the lens gets longer the
photographer<00:05:05.270> steps<00:05:05.540> back<00:05:05.780> we're<00:05:05.990> getting<00:05:06.170> a

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
photographer steps back we're getting a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.900 
photographer steps back we're getting a
completely<00:05:06.620> different<00:05:06.770> perspective<00:05:07.130> the

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
completely different perspective the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.610 
completely different perspective the
long<00:05:08.120> lens<00:05:08.330> is<00:05:08.630> from<00:05:09.260> further<00:05:09.470> away

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
long lens is from further away

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.650 
long lens is from further away
condensing<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:11.000> perspective<00:05:11.480> and<00:05:11.570> it's

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
condensing that perspective and it's

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.880 
condensing that perspective and it's
also<00:05:11.810> removing<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.470> lot<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.650> background

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
also removing a lot of background

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.470 
also removing a lot of background
information<00:05:13.340> which<00:05:13.760> could<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.120> really

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
information which could be a really

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.360 
information which could be a really
useful<00:05:14.660> way<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.230> eliminating<00:05:16.160> background

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
useful way of eliminating background

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.970 
useful way of eliminating background
noise<00:05:16.760> and<00:05:17.000> fast<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.570> isolating<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.500> subject

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
noise and fast and isolating a subject

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.950 
noise and fast and isolating a subject
making<00:05:19.220> a<00:05:19.250> more<00:05:19.370> dramatic<00:05:19.490> shot<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.840> other

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
making a more dramatic shot the other

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.270 
making a more dramatic shot the other
thing<00:05:21.170> I<00:05:21.260> notice<00:05:21.560> about<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.100> 200

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
thing I notice about that the 200

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.790 
thing I notice about that the 200
particularly<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.420> that<00:05:23.810> amount<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.320> focus<00:05:24.680> in

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
particularly is that amount of focus in

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.290 
particularly is that amount of focus in
the<00:05:24.830> background<00:05:25.280> it's<00:05:25.430> really<00:05:25.490> starting<00:05:26.060> to

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
the background it's really starting to

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.630 
the background it's really starting to
drop<00:05:26.660> off<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.770> function<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.250> using

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
drop off that is a function of using

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.460 
drop off that is a function of using
longer<00:05:28.820> lenses<00:05:29.180> as<00:05:29.390> our<00:05:29.540> lens<00:05:29.720> gets<00:05:29.960> longer

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
longer lenses as our lens gets longer

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.780 
longer lenses as our lens gets longer
the<00:05:30.800> amount<00:05:31.100> that's<00:05:31.190> in<00:05:31.340> focus<00:05:31.460> in<00:05:31.700> the

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
the amount that's in focus in the

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.840 
the amount that's in focus in the
background<00:05:32.300> appears<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.320> reduce<00:05:33.740> but<00:05:34.700> what

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
background appears to reduce but what

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.850 
background appears to reduce but what
really<00:05:35.150> controls<00:05:35.480> the<00:05:35.990> amount<00:05:36.230> of<00:05:36.410> focus<00:05:36.620> in

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
really controls the amount of focus in

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.950 
really controls the amount of focus in
an<00:05:36.950> image<00:05:37.190> is<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.760> iris<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.360> lens<00:05:38.540> the

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
an image is the iris in the lens the

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.230 
an image is the iris in the lens the
aperture<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.740> that's<00:05:40.490> an<00:05:40.640> effect<00:05:40.940> that<00:05:41.030> we

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
aperture and that's an effect that we

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.840 
aperture and that's an effect that we
call<00:05:41.419> depth<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.990> field<00:05:45.010> so<00:05:46.010> what<00:05:46.190> is<00:05:46.370> that<00:05:46.700> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
call depth of field so what is that the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.250 
call depth of field so what is that the
field<00:05:47.150> well<00:05:48.370> this<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:49.580> depth<00:05:49.820> of<00:05:50.000> field

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
field well this is depth of field

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.840 
field well this is depth of field
basically<00:05:51.260> it's<00:05:51.500> how<00:05:51.620> much<00:05:52.010> is<00:05:52.250> in<00:05:52.370> focus<00:05:52.550> in

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
basically it's how much is in focus in

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.390 
basically it's how much is in focus in
our<00:05:52.940> image<00:05:53.240> from<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.050> very<00:05:54.230> near<00:05:54.590> to<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.250> very

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
our image from the very near to the very

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.159 
our image from the very near to the very
far<00:05:55.700> there's<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.330> volume<00:05:56.540> of<00:05:56.720> space<00:05:56.780> in<00:05:57.080> front

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
far there's a volume of space in front

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.450 
far there's a volume of space in front
of<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.380> camera<00:05:57.740> where<00:05:58.130> there's<00:05:58.250> going<00:05:58.340> to<00:05:58.400> be

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
of the camera where there's going to be

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.190 
of the camera where there's going to be
sharpness<00:05:59.060> and<00:05:59.300> then<00:05:59.600> there's<00:05:59.750> gonna<00:05:59.840> drop

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
sharpness and then there's gonna drop

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.250 
sharpness and then there's gonna drop
off<00:06:00.440> into<00:06:00.740> blur<00:06:01.270> so<00:06:02.270> how<00:06:02.450> do<00:06:02.510> we<00:06:02.570> control<00:06:02.810> depth

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
off into blur so how do we control depth

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.990 
off into blur so how do we control depth
of<00:06:03.380> field<00:06:03.620> well<00:06:04.250> it's<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.460> function<00:06:04.820> of<00:06:04.910> the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
of field well it's a function of the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.270 
of field well it's a function of the
type<00:06:05.180> of<00:06:05.330> lens<00:06:05.540> we<00:06:05.720> use<00:06:05.960> long<00:06:06.560> lenses<00:06:06.950> tend<00:06:07.130> to

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
type of lens we use long lenses tend to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.280 
type of lens we use long lenses tend to
give<00:06:07.400> a<00:06:07.430> shallower<00:06:07.880> depth<00:06:08.120> of<00:06:08.300> field<00:06:08.540> than

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
give a shallower depth of field than

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.230 
give a shallower depth of field than
wide<00:06:09.500> lenses<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.850> other<00:06:10.970> thing<00:06:11.210> that

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
wide lenses the other thing that

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.820 
wide lenses the other thing that
controls<00:06:11.630> it<00:06:11.810> is<00:06:11.870> how<00:06:11.990> close<00:06:12.290> we<00:06:12.530> are<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.680> our

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
controls it is how close we are to our

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.520 
controls it is how close we are to our
subject<00:06:13.040> as<00:06:13.250> we<00:06:13.400> move<00:06:13.610> in<00:06:14.140> focus<00:06:15.140> drops<00:06:15.350> off

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
subject as we move in focus drops off

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.040 
subject as we move in focus drops off
depth<00:06:15.890> of<00:06:16.040> field<00:06:16.190> decreases<00:06:16.630> but<00:06:17.630> what<00:06:17.750> really

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
depth of field decreases but what really

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.260 
depth of field decreases but what really
controls<00:06:18.380> depth<00:06:18.830> of<00:06:19.010> field<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.490> our<00:06:19.880> aperture

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
controls depth of field is our aperture

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.560 
controls depth of field is our aperture
the<00:06:20.810> iris<00:06:21.169> in<00:06:21.290> our<00:06:21.410> lens<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:21.830> how<00:06:21.950> we<00:06:22.010> set<00:06:22.310> it

focus<00:06:31.520> but<00:06:32.450> when<00:06:32.600> we<00:06:32.690> use<00:06:32.840> wide<00:06:33.110> apertures<00:06:33.680> we

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
focus but when we use wide apertures we

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.560 
focus but when we use wide apertures we
get<00:06:34.250> shallow<00:06:34.490> depth<00:06:34.760> of<00:06:34.850> field<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.270> that<00:06:35.419> can

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
get shallow depth of field and that can

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.090 
get shallow depth of field and that can
be<00:06:35.690> really<00:06:35.960> useful<00:06:36.470> for<00:06:36.500> throwing<00:06:36.919> a
