00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.849
 now all but one or two farms of floriculturists this time we are going 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.130
 we did the most basic handling of idc of macorís 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 well a little bit in the rises I can go back with worlds happening at least in 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.480
 its colors so accustomed to hawsawi law 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.009
 and they want to go to steve nash tesistán 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.390
 wolf 1 the most striking that between canticles against that sector 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.960
 in constructive terms and desktop icons 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.960
 and some taskbar 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.530
 well manuel mosquera in the long pause part and more and less 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.970
 and in the lower part of the taskbar 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.610
 the cost of money a taskbar we have many more you stay on 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 silver plate where she lives with 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.740
 yes or no / work 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.570
 i in the document was 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.020
 in 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.250
 to the right desperate 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.050
 ain in the document yes folders and to the left is that party since 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.860
 be separate 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.690
 there are applications 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.880
 the mayor 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
 if we go to what we find things in its margins here we have the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.360
 documents pedroso explanations 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.190
 and an emmy we can not settle 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.760
 in key with mac os x no 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 what it is 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.329
 Ireland in Dublin 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.530
 in each of the programs we can do 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.990
 the opening of the jamases almost instantaneous in many cases reads in everything 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 case 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.790
 for that reason of the match per day 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.510
 that good 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.960
 has a very big advantage is that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.480
 in him in windows with the passage of time 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.150
 the programs panama will be a disk problems with registration always 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.280
 ends the world but rather slower after a passage of time 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.719
 in the protests and since you take it you do not notice you do not notice a lot 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.760
 we do not record here below and so the program as well as know that here 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.590
 above 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 we have a bar that we do not have the amount is very good top of the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.449
 window that is completely clean 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.079
 we keep from panty 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.269
 however here we have a series of poison 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.519
 these less reads 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.059
 depend on the window that is open up to 1 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.360
 we have not won 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.199
 hamoui light 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.749
 let's make an open application for example 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.929
 This room has a series of ee menus 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.539
 on top of 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.189
 good yes we will see if we can save the file that we are 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.519
 working on it or we can open a file no 1 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.479
 or yes for example we are going to a folder 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.199
 then we have an option is to copy paste oo 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.330
 for example I receive new winner a folder 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.820
 director enrique's new film in which we find ourselves not 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.439
 but nevertheless 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.209
 in the Pyrenees and light not the program ko s do not run 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.079
 I do not know if we start going afloat 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.469
 Let's go from a split application 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.459
 and well also stopped and now we are going to stop 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.479
 arafat aloft with this case the low environments 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.609
 if we go to the grain 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.579
 we must what 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.709
 the one that we hope that in his development he commented to save it 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.219
 basically it's the same 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.569
 but the one that young people have mac applications will never have 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.419
 never more paranoid inside the window itself but enough argued 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.040
 if I were the castle xavi 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.509
 with the march and then they did see 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.569
 during that phase 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.139
 we also have pacheco and nascar visualization races these are the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.199
 less than that street Teresa who before this room the state 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.569
 the name of rolando zárate 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.159
 yes I also board 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.090
 already directly orange - not worth it so we're always going to have there 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.399
 up the menus of life make Spain 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.149
 the site was injured the xi tournament 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:04.429
 of the 21st century he did not want us to see he will be the slaughter 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:09.469
 the corpse was form frames file browser 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.299
 if windows phone hubs we have this file work team that is the 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.569
 explorer 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.239
 the napoles what we have is called putting 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.770
 basically is that is 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.010
 then he 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.249
 concretely we can continue to work seriously 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.139
 like kate moss m windows 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.490
 In case, for example, I have clear actions and torments, I have an agape 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.470
 transient 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.069
 from certain sectors 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.520
 I'm doing 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.950
 well he said that create a new proposal and here we have a love 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.400
 Read as we did in 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550
 in which muñoz site I meet here 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.009
 I'm leaving then my personal folder medical file 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.900
 / folder is created 1 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.309
 percent 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.709
 I do not want the management of the leader panel is just very similar 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.910
 there was no is not healthy for the different experts not 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.330
 a cult 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.389
 i 1 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.710
 the inter won 2 kilos less because we already explained them now born
