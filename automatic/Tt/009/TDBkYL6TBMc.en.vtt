00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
up to the top of this hill although the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.150 
up to the top of this hill although the
enemy<00:00:59.600> does<00:00:59.630> have<00:01:00.020> some<00:01:00.290> pretty<00:01:00.560> fast<00:01:00.920> tanks

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
as you can see there couple of T 50s all

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.200 
as you can see there couple of T 50s all
the<00:01:03.500> ones<00:01:03.739> now<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.009> been<00:01:04.129> taken<00:01:04.460> out<00:01:04.610> so

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
the ones now have been taken out so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.670 
the ones now have been taken out so
there<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.600> chance<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.020> he<00:01:06.170> could<00:01:06.200> stumble

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
there is a chance that he could stumble

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.710 
there is a chance that he could stumble
across<00:01:06.950> one<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:07.579> those<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.210> have<00:01:08.329> to<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:08.540> into

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
across one of those and have to get into

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.940 
across one of those and have to get into
a<00:01:08.899> jewel<00:01:10.479> but<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.570> looks<00:01:11.810> like<00:01:12.229> he's<00:01:12.470> made<00:01:12.799> it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
a jewel but it looks like he's made it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.950 
a jewel but it looks like he's made it
up<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.340> first<00:01:13.759> and<00:01:14.000> there's<00:01:14.180> nobody<00:01:14.450> else<00:01:14.659> in

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
up here first and there's nobody else in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.109 
up here first and there's nobody else in
this<00:01:15.409> position<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.640> just<00:01:16.790> going<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.969> have<00:01:17.090> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
this position so just going to have a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.480 
this position so just going to have a
spot<00:01:17.450> around<00:01:17.719> see<00:01:17.960> who<00:01:18.109> we<00:01:18.200> can<00:01:18.229> see<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.799> three

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
spot around see who we can see is three

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.969 
spot around see who we can see is three
they're<00:01:19.759> steaming<00:01:20.450> across<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.469> open<00:01:21.950> ground

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
they're steaming across the open ground

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.800 
they're steaming across the open ground
probably<00:01:22.700> going<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.909> get<00:01:23.060> hit<00:01:23.299> for<00:01:23.630> his

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
probably going to get hit for his

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.859 
probably going to get hit for his
trouble

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.539 

so<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.140> hit<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> side<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
so that's a good hit on the side of the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
so that's a good hit on the side of the
is-3<00:01:33.060> therefore<00:01:33.539> she<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.899> all<00:01:34.020> soaked<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
is-3 therefore she it was all soaked up

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
is-3 therefore she it was all soaked up
by<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> track<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.579> getting

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
by the track so I'm not really getting

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.359 
by the track so I'm not really getting
any<00:01:36.360> damage<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> try<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:37.920> take<00:01:38.039> up

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
any damage just going to try and take up

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
any damage just going to try and take up
a<00:01:38.490> better<00:01:38.850> fire<00:01:39.149> position<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.750> who<00:01:39.899> else

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
a better fire position see who else

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.770 
a better fire position see who else
think<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.289> spots<00:01:40.530> he's<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> type<00:01:41.009> 59<00:01:41.189> but

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
think the spots he's the type 59 but

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
think the spots he's the type 59 but
unfortunately<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.860> his<00:01:44.189> turret

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
unfortunately only really see his turret

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.919 
unfortunately only really see his turret
there<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.969> there's<00:01:45.179> no<00:01:45.450> chance<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
there and there's no chance of that

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.480 
there and there's no chance of that
being<00:01:46.229> penetrated<00:01:46.530> especially<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
being penetrated especially from this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.039 
being penetrated especially from this
fringe<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.569> to<00:01:48.630> give<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
fringe so I'm just going to give up the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.779 
fringe so I'm just going to give up the
shot<00:01:50.569> so<00:01:51.569> as<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:51.960> they've<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.319> ear

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
shot so as you can see they've got ear

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.520 
shot so as you can see they've got ear
t54<00:01:53.789> on<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.329> hill<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.719> with<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> heavy<00:01:55.229> tank

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
the base capture that was being done by
