changes i would like to see in the
season<00:00:13.850> for<00:00:14.060> like<00:00:14.360> voice<00:00:15.020> supports

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
season for like voice supports

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.650 
season for like voice supports
especially<00:00:16.250> because<00:00:16.790> i<00:00:16.880> also<00:00:17.030> play<00:00:17.270> support

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
especially because i also play support

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.710 
especially because i also play support
it's<00:00:17.869> like<00:00:18.850> my<00:00:19.850> most<00:00:20.090> problem<00:00:20.420> right<00:00:20.570> now<00:00:20.600> is

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
it's like my most problem right now is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.230 
it's like my most problem right now is
like<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.470> oracle<00:00:21.890> because<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.850> have<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.060> buy

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
like the oracle because you have to buy

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.150 
like the oracle because you have to buy
it<00:00:23.270> now<00:00:23.540> and<00:00:23.720> like<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:24.140> four<00:00:24.590> minutes<00:00:24.890> instead

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
it now and like a four minutes instead

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.339 
it now and like a four minutes instead
of<00:00:25.220> five<00:00:25.520> or<00:00:25.820> it<00:00:26.180> was<00:00:26.360> like<00:00:26.540> before<00:00:26.779> union<00:00:27.200> for

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
of five or it was like before union for

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.620 
of five or it was like before union for
the<00:00:27.380> whole<00:00:27.710> time<00:00:27.830> till<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.130> die<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.180> you're

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
the whole time till you die so you're

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.749 
the whole time till you die so you're
kind<00:00:29.869> of<00:00:29.930> forced<00:00:30.110> to<00:00:30.369> spend<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:31.460> lot<00:00:31.610> of<00:00:31.640> money

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
kind of forced to spend a lot of money

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.660 
kind of forced to spend a lot of money
for<00:00:32.390> something<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.290> shouldn't<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.370> if<00:00:34.460> they

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
for something you shouldn't and if they

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.670 
for something you shouldn't and if they
change<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.390> somehow<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:36.290> could<00:00:36.500> be<00:00:36.620> really

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
change this somehow it could be really

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.930 
change this somehow it could be really
good<00:00:36.800> for<00:00:37.010> supports<00:00:37.310> you<00:00:37.370> can<00:00:37.520> actually<00:00:37.640> buy

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
good for supports you can actually buy

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.880 
good for supports you can actually buy
items<00:00:38.120> 10<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.690> then<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.140> will<00:00:39.380> be<00:00:39.560> much<00:00:39.739> more

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
items 10 and then you will be much more

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.650 
items 10 and then you will be much more
useful<00:00:39.950> in<00:00:40.399> late<00:00:40.550> games<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.510> could

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
useful in late games and you could

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.380 
useful in late games and you could
vibrate<00:00:41.840> your<00:00:42.829> item<00:00:43.340> build<00:00:43.550> goes<00:00:44.000> round<00:00:44.180> you

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
vibrate your item build goes round you

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.560 
vibrate your item build goes round you
just<00:00:44.629> put<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.840> same<00:00:45.019> every<00:00:45.289> time<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.030> also<00:00:47.030> um

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
just put the same every time and also um

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.049 
just put the same every time and also um
I<00:00:48.289> hope<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:48.980> some<00:00:49.129> channel<00:00:49.489> changes<00:00:49.789> but<00:00:49.940> not

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
I hope for some channel changes but not

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.360 
I hope for some channel changes but not
too<00:00:50.179> much<00:00:50.210> because<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.469> kind<00:00:52.010> of<00:00:52.070> good<00:00:52.219> how

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
too much because it's kind of good how

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.849 
too much because it's kind of good how
it<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.640> right<00:00:52.820> now<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.809> only<00:00:53.870> problem<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.620> find

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
it is right now the only problem I find

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.950 
it is right now the only problem I find
is<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.010> fall<00:00:55.460> everyone<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.629> there<00:00:56.780> are<00:00:56.870> not

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
is a fall everyone that there are not

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.840 
is a fall everyone that there are not
many<00:00:57.140> options<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.399> cannot<00:00:58.609> only

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
many options because you cannot only

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.849 
many options because you cannot only
steal<00:00:59.239> one<00:00:59.390> before<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:00.379> do<00:01:00.589> your<00:01:00.620> own

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
steal one before you just do your own

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.189 
steal one before you just do your own
and<00:01:01.250> while<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:01.730> just<00:01:02.000> may<00:01:02.449> be<00:01:02.510> due<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.750> box<00:01:03.079> at

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
and while you just may be due to box at

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.780 
and while you just may be due to box at
the<00:01:03.260> same<00:01:03.440> time<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:03.739> it's<00:01:03.890> pretty<00:01:04.190> limited<00:01:04.640> so

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
the same time but it's pretty limited so

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.360 
the same time but it's pretty limited so
there<00:01:05.480> should<00:01:05.630> be<00:01:05.750> some<00:01:05.930> changes<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.370> improve

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
there should be some changes to improve

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.190 
there should be some changes to improve
it<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.910> have<00:01:08.090> more<00:01:08.270> action<00:01:08.570> everyone<00:01:08.900> because

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
it to have more action everyone because

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.899 
it to have more action everyone because
right<00:01:09.380> now<00:01:09.410> it's<00:01:09.680> really<00:01:10.070> boring<00:01:10.310> again<00:01:10.670> I

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
right now it's really boring again I

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.830 
right now it's really boring again I
would<00:01:11.630> like<00:01:11.840> right<00:01:12.230> to<00:01:12.470> change<00:01:13.570> back<00:01:14.570> there

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
would like right to change back there

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.180 
would like right to change back there
ehlo<00:01:15.409> system<00:01:15.830> like<00:01:16.370> bring<00:01:16.760> bring<00:01:17.180> back<00:01:17.450> from

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
ehlo system like bring bring back from

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.330 
ehlo system like bring bring back from
season<00:01:19.190> two<00:01:19.660> I<00:01:20.660> would<00:01:21.500> like<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:22.100> some

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
season two I would like to see some

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.400 
season two I would like to see some
items<00:01:22.760> changes<00:01:23.150> like<00:01:23.390> four<00:01:23.690> major<00:01:23.870> I<00:01:24.050> think

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
items changes like four major I think

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.160 
items changes like four major I think
it's<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:25.760> little<00:01:25.910> bit<00:01:26.090> risky<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.690> buy<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.900> now

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's a little bit risky to buy it now

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.120 
it's a little bit risky to buy it now
and<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:28.040> think<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.150> should<00:01:29.330> be<00:01:29.390> more<00:01:30.130> cost

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
and I think it should be more cost

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.200 
and I think it should be more cost
efficient<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:32.330> just<00:01:32.530> bite<00:01:33.530> early<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.210> have

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
efficient to just bite early and have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.560 
efficient to just bite early and have
some<00:01:35.540> vinyl<00:01:35.810> advantage<00:01:36.880> over<00:01:37.880> if<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.360> bite

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
some vinyl advantage over if you bite

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.620 
some vinyl advantage over if you bite
and<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.920> doesn't<00:01:40.280> give<00:01:40.400> health<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.270> should

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and it doesn't give health it should

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.520 
and it doesn't give health it should
give<00:01:41.900> some<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.620> think<00:01:42.950> regional<00:01:43.900> health<00:01:44.900> health

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
give some I think regional health health

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.350 
give some I think regional health health
man<00:01:45.920> has<00:01:46.130> something<00:01:46.610> some<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:46.820> something<00:01:47.240> to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
man has something some of something to

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.680 
man has something some of something to
sustain<00:01:47.600> lane<00:01:48.290> because<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.800> have<00:01:48.920> nothing<00:01:49.690> you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
sustain lane because we have nothing you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.260 
sustain lane because we have nothing you
have<00:01:50.780> nothing<00:01:50.810> expect<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.120> ability<00:01:53.120> power

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
have nothing expect the ability power

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.100 
have nothing expect the ability power
like<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:53.780> 20<00:01:54.260> ability<00:01:54.560> power<00:01:54.680> for<00:01:55.780> 1300<00:01:56.780> gold

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
like it's 20 ability power for 1300 gold

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.750 
like it's 20 ability power for 1300 gold
it's<00:01:57.730> not<00:01:58.730> much<00:01:59.620> season<00:02:00.620> 4<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:01.130> would<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.490> to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
it's not much season 4 I would like to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.140 
it's not much season 4 I would like to
have<00:02:02.240> some<00:02:02.420> changes<00:02:02.810> for<00:02:02.840> supports<00:02:04.150> maybe

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
have some changes for supports maybe

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.810 
have some changes for supports maybe
more<00:02:05.540> various<00:02:05.870> type<00:02:06.140> builds<00:02:06.650> more<00:02:07.280> gold<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.700> we

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
more various type builds more gold so we

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.290

of<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.400> skills<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.120> game<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.920> game

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
of this skills in game I think the game

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.400 
of this skills in game I think the game
is<00:02:36.100> pretty<00:02:36.400> balanced<00:02:36.790> right<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.260> think

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
is pretty balanced right now so I think

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.250 
is pretty balanced right now so I think
it's<00:02:38.680> fine<00:02:38.980> maybe<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.610> nap<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.360> Trinity<00:02:40.840> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
it's fine maybe a nap of Trinity is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.550 
it's fine maybe a nap of Trinity is
coming<00:02:41.709> up<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.069> out<00:02:42.520> because<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.989> see<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> lot<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
coming up I out because we see a lot of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.220 
coming up I out because we see a lot of
cocky<00:02:45.130> playing<00:02:45.370> back<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.330> been<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
cocky playing back and it's been so I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.400 
cocky playing back and it's been so I
think<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.280> main<00:02:48.489> change<00:02:48.880> was<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.569> be<00:02:49.989> done

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
every game in season four I would like

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.970 
every game in season four I would like
road<00:03:38.200> games<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.799> change<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.370> rating<00:03:40.180> system

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
road games to change the rating system

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.340 
road games to change the rating system
back<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.370> previous<00:03:42.850> one<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:44.079> was<00:03:44.230> in

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
back to the previous one that was in

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.280 
back to the previous one that was in
season<00:03:44.590> two<00:03:45.209> because<00:03:46.209> right<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.780> can<00:03:47.019> see

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
season two because right now you can see

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.310 
season two because right now you can see
your<00:03:47.500> hidden<00:03:48.280> illo<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:50.130> everything<00:03:51.130> is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
your hidden illo but everything is

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.080 
your hidden illo but everything is
reliable<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.680> anyways<00:03:55.170> also<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:57.090> think

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
reliable on this anyways also I think

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.599 
reliable on this anyways also I think
some<00:03:58.359> champions<00:03:58.810> should<00:03:59.079> be<00:03:59.290> balanced<00:04:00.250> or

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
some champions should be balanced or

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.080 
some champions should be balanced or
rework<00:04:01.150> like<00:04:01.480> we<00:04:01.810> don't<00:04:01.989> see<00:04:02.489> many<00:04:03.489> champions

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
rework like we don't see many champions

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.210 
rework like we don't see many champions
in<00:04:04.239> competitive<00:04:04.989> games<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:05.769> they<00:04:06.040> are

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
in competitive games because they are

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.539 
in competitive games because they are
not<00:04:06.250> as<00:04:06.640> useful<00:04:06.850> as<00:04:07.329> others<00:04:07.840> like

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
not as useful as others like

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.450 
not as useful as others like
heimerdinger<00:04:09.549> or

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
heimerdinger or

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
really strong champions like fees which

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.110 
really strong champions like fees which
with<00:04:20.700> some<00:04:20.940> elite<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:21.660> like<00:04:22.670> super<00:04:23.670> hard<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
with some elite it's like super hard to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.530 
with some elite it's like super hard to
deal<00:04:24.270> with<00:04:24.300> him<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.530> changing<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:27.000> around

deal with him the changing that I around

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.660 
deal with him the changing that I around
for<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> season<00:04:28.560> four<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.980> think<00:04:29.250> will<00:04:29.520> be

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
for the season four I think will be

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.720 
for the season four I think will be
about<00:04:30.000> as<00:04:30.510> Emmett<00:04:30.900> actually<00:04:31.410> about<00:04:31.920> AD

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
about as Emmett actually about AD

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.120 
about as Emmett actually about AD
carries<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.390> support<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.110> mid<00:04:34.290> laner<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.740> want

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
carries a support the mid laner I want

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.750 
carries a support the mid laner I want
to<00:04:35.280> see<00:04:35.520> everything<00:04:36.060> change<00:04:36.930> about<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.760> very

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
to see everything change about that very

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.870 
to see everything change about that very
particular<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.540> because<00:04:40.520> Korean<00:04:41.520> are

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
particular that because Korean are

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.870 
particular that because Korean are
coming<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.480> a<00:04:42.540> new<00:04:42.780> meta<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.610> double<00:04:44.610> ad

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
coming with a new meta like double ad

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.480 
coming with a new meta like double ad
carries<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.810> there's<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.500> think<00:04:46.740> we

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
carries and and there's and I think we

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.820 
carries and and there's and I think we
really<00:04:47.790> need<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.240> adapt<00:04:48.680> about<00:04:49.680> that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.860 

I<00:04:54.920> think<00:04:55.760> there<00:04:55.850> shouldn't<00:04:56.120> be<00:04:56.210> an<00:04:56.420> additional

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
I think there shouldn't be an additional

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.800 
I think there shouldn't be an additional
bunt<00:04:57.080> for<00:04:57.260> season<00:04:57.530> 4<00:04:57.940> because<00:04:58.940> especially<00:04:59.510> for

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
bunt for season 4 because especially for

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.630 
bunt for season 4 because especially for
solar<00:05:00.020> q<00:05:00.260> maybe<00:05:00.560> for<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.830> competitive<00:05:01.160> play<00:05:01.580> it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
solar q maybe for a competitive play it

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.000 
solar q maybe for a competitive play it
would<00:05:01.820> be<00:05:01.970> good<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.330> another<00:05:02.450> bun<00:05:02.870> but<00:05:03.710> if

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
would be good to have another bun but if

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.470 
would be good to have another bun but if
you<00:05:04.160> have<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.400> too<00:05:04.670> many<00:05:04.790> bands<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.300> can

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
you have like too many bands you can

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.260 
you have like too many bands you can
actually<00:05:05.870> open<00:05:06.230> a<00:05:06.650> single<00:05:07.280> player<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.700> I

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
actually open a single player and I

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.240 
actually open a single player and I
don't<00:05:08.450> think<00:05:08.570> that's<00:05:08.750> good<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.200> have<00:05:09.350> because

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
don't think that's good to have because

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.420 
don't think that's good to have because
it<00:05:10.580> would<00:05:10.910> change<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.840> came<00:05:11.990> too<00:05:12.140> much<00:05:12.430> I'm

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
it would change you came too much I'm

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.730 
it would change you came too much I'm
refined<00:05:13.910> with<00:05:14.030> numbers<00:05:14.450> of<00:05:14.690> bands<00:05:14.960> right<00:05:15.530> now

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
refined with numbers of bands right now

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.900 
refined with numbers of bands right now
I<00:05:15.770> think<00:05:15.920> if<00:05:16.930> rise<00:05:17.930> would<00:05:18.230> add<00:05:18.500> even<00:05:19.430> one<00:05:19.640> bond

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
I think if rise would add even one bond

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.930 
I think if rise would add even one bond
and<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.300> should<00:05:20.540> then<00:05:21.140> it<00:05:21.350> would<00:05:21.560> really<00:05:22.070> break

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
and it should then it would really break

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.830 
and it should then it would really break
the<00:05:23.120> meta<00:05:23.300> I<00:05:23.480> think<00:05:23.780> because<00:05:24.740> like<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:26.570> first

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
the meta I think because like the first

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.350 
the meta I think because like the first
pic<00:05:27.080> gives<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.620> advantage<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.190> if<00:05:28.490> you<00:05:28.760> if

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
pic gives you advantage and if you if

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.750 
pic gives you advantage and if you if
you<00:05:29.570> would<00:05:29.690> burn<00:05:30.560> one<00:05:30.770> more<00:05:30.980> hero<00:05:31.190> like<00:05:31.490> two

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
you would burn one more hero like two

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.000 
you would burn one more hero like two
heroes<00:05:32.090> one<00:05:32.810> per<00:05:32.960> team<00:05:33.140> then<00:05:33.380> it<00:05:33.650> wouldn't

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
heroes one per team then it wouldn't

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.810 
heroes one per team then it wouldn't
make<00:05:34.160> sense<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.670> to<00:05:35.210> go<00:05:35.360> first<00:05:35.570> pick<00:05:36.430> well<00:05:37.430> I

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
make sense to to go first pick well I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.940 
make sense to to go first pick well I
think<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.450> think<00:05:38.720> right<00:05:38.900> now<00:05:39.080> right<00:05:39.500> shouldn't

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
think I think right now right shouldn't

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.180 
think I think right now right shouldn't
introduce<00:05:40.580> any<00:05:40.970> more<00:05:41.420> bands<00:05:41.630> because

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
introduce any more bands because

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.170 
introduce any more bands because
everyone<00:05:43.190> managed<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.640> play<00:05:43.790> with<00:05:44.000> three

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
everyone managed to play with three

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.680 
everyone managed to play with three
bands<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:45.310> any<00:05:46.310> more<00:05:46.580> would<00:05:46.760> make<00:05:46.970> out

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
bands and any more would make out

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.110 
bands and any more would make out
binding<00:05:48.170> one<00:05:48.290> person<00:05:48.740> much<00:05:49.100> easier<00:05:49.460> because

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
binding one person much easier because

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.490 
binding one person much easier because
it's<00:05:50.390> not<00:05:50.480> about<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.840> champion<00:05:51.200> pool<00:05:51.350> is

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
it's not about the champion pool is

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.280 
it's not about the champion pool is
about<00:05:52.210> champions<00:05:53.210> at<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.360> person<00:05:53.810> place<00:05:54.020> and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
about champions at the person place and

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.820 
about champions at the person place and
one<00:05:54.560> person<00:05:54.950> can<00:05:55.130> play<00:05:56.020> like<00:05:57.020> 10<00:05:57.290> champions<00:05:57.710> at

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
one person can play like 10 champions at

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.190 
one person can play like 10 champions at
top<00:05:57.980> level<00:05:58.310> maybe<00:05:59.000> five<00:05:59.300> if<00:05:59.660> he's<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.930> really

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
top level maybe five if he's a really

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.080 
top level maybe five if he's a really
good<00:06:00.350> player<00:06:00.470> but<00:06:00.730> afterwards<00:06:01.730> is<00:06:01.880> much

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
good player but afterwards is much

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.290 
good player but afterwards is much
harder<00:06:02.560> about<00:06:03.560> additional<00:06:04.130> bus<00:06:04.400> I<00:06:04.730> think

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
harder about additional bus I think

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.890 
harder about additional bus I think
there<00:06:05.630> should<00:06:06.320> be<00:06:06.350> more<00:06:06.530> right<00:06:07.400> now<00:06:07.640> free<00:06:08.390> for

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
there should be more right now free for

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.320 
there should be more right now free for
team<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:09.230> not<00:06:09.440> enough<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:10.310> three<00:06:10.520> depends<00:06:11.150> on

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
team is not enough the three depends on

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.570 
team is not enough the three depends on
the<00:06:11.690> patch<00:06:11.870> is<00:06:11.900> played<00:06:12.290> as<00:06:12.470> well<00:06:12.500> because<00:06:13.100> the

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
the patch is played as well because the

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.750 
the patch is played as well because the
one<00:06:13.730> patch<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.210> other<00:06:15.050> than<00:06:15.170> another<00:06:15.620> and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
one patch is other than another and

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.310 
one patch is other than another and
sometimes<00:06:16.760> free<00:06:17.000> bonds<00:06:17.270> can<00:06:17.600> be<00:06:17.630> enough<00:06:17.990> but<00:06:18.260> i

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
sometimes free bonds can be enough but i

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.320 
sometimes free bonds can be enough but i
think<00:06:18.710> that<00:06:18.790> increasing<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.820> number<00:06:20.150> two

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
think that increasing the number two

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.350 
think that increasing the number two
four<00:06:20.570> or<00:06:20.600> even<00:06:20.810> five<00:06:20.990> would<00:06:21.500> be<00:06:21.530> really<00:06:22.070> good

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.420 
bands I don't know I think six is pretty
good<00:07:07.390> actually<00:07:07.600> because<00:07:08.230> if<00:07:08.680> we<00:07:08.980> need<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.280> see

more<00:07:09.640> bands<00:07:09.910> that<00:07:10.270> mean<00:07:10.480> the<00:07:10.960> game<00:07:11.140> is

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
more bands that mean the game is

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.920 
more bands that mean the game is
