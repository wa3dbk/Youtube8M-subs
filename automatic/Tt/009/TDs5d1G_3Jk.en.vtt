that hairs here so I do is I will take
it<00:01:57.510> both<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> dubbings<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> same<00:01:59.010> time

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it both the dubbings at the same time

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.700 
it both the dubbings at the same time
and<00:01:59.610> I'll<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.330> kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.720> run<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.290> fingers

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and I'll just kind of run my fingers

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.210 
and I'll just kind of run my fingers
through<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.390> each<00:02:03.390> time<00:02:04.010> pinching<00:02:05.010> there

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.140 
with that hairs here and I'll just kind
of<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.480> through<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.750> entire<00:02:12.870> pile<00:02:13.879> not<00:02:14.879> very

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
of go through the entire pile not very

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300 
of go through the entire pile not very
complicated<00:02:15.540> process<00:02:16.019> but<00:02:16.319> again<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:17.190> if

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
complicated process but again like if

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.680 
complicated process but again like if
you're<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.090> tying<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.420> couple

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
you're going to be just tying a couple

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.280 
you're going to be just tying a couple
of<00:02:18.750> flies<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.349> there's<00:02:19.530> no<00:02:19.680> sense<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
of flies with it there's no sense and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.949 
of flies with it there's no sense and
in<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.730> know<00:02:21.849> bringing<00:02:22.360> breaking<00:02:22.780> out<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
in you know bringing breaking out the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
in you know bringing breaking out the
coffee<00:02:23.170> grinder<00:02:23.650> mixing<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.129> entire<00:02:24.370> thing

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
coffee grinder mixing the entire thing

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.949 
coffee grinder mixing the entire thing
so<00:02:24.819> I'll<00:02:24.879> just<00:02:25.060> kind<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.359> blend<00:02:25.599> that<00:02:25.750> with

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
so I'll just kind of blend that with

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.599 
so I'll just kind of blend that with
between<00:02:26.469> my<00:02:26.590> fingers<00:02:26.920> for<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.219> second<00:02:27.549> or<00:02:27.640> two

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
between my fingers for a second or two

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.800 
between my fingers for a second or two
we<00:02:30.609> pull<00:02:30.849> out<00:02:31.000> some<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.359> big<00:02:31.510> orange

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
we pull out some of the big orange

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.509 
we pull out some of the big orange
chunks<00:02:32.319> because<00:02:32.409> we<00:02:32.560> don't<00:02:32.739> want<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.950> huge

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
chunks because we don't want a huge

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.720 
chunks because we don't want a huge
amount<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:33.909> that<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> basically<00:02:36.159> what<00:02:36.549> I<00:02:36.609> end

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
amount of that so basically what I end

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.880 
amount of that so basically what I end
up<00:02:36.849> is<00:02:36.970> kind<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.239> like<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> an<00:02:37.890> orange

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
up is kind of like a an orange

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.580 
up is kind of like a an orange
highlighted<00:02:39.670> dub<00:02:40.709> nothing<00:02:41.709> fancy<00:02:42.129> there<00:02:43.590> pull

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
highlighted dub nothing fancy there pull

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.399 
highlighted dub nothing fancy there pull
off<00:02:44.739> enough<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.870> dub<00:02:46.870> my<00:02:47.109> my<00:02:47.530> body<00:02:48.719> so<00:02:49.719> I<00:02:50.079> will

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
off enough to dub my my body so I will

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.960 
off enough to dub my my body so I will
take<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:51.459> dubbing<00:02:52.030> I'll<00:02:52.780> start<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
take that dubbing I'll start on the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.839 
take that dubbing I'll start on the
thread<00:02:55.239> here<00:02:55.599> what<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.530> typically<00:02:57.099> do<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.430> I'll

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
thread here what I typically do is I'll

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.819 
thread here what I typically do is I'll
get<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.239> first<00:02:58.659> couple<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.019> wraps<00:02:59.230> nice<00:02:59.590> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
get that first couple of wraps nice and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.440 
get that first couple of wraps nice and
tight<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.189> there<00:03:00.370> that's<00:03:00.609> important<00:03:01.269> because

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
tight on there that's important because

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.750 
tight on there that's important because
once<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.959> get<00:03:02.079> that<00:03:02.290> going<00:03:02.349> the<00:03:03.340> rest<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.700> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
once you get that going the rest of that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.309 
once you get that going the rest of that
dubbing<00:03:04.180> will<00:03:04.299> kind<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.540> follow<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.930> line

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
dubbing will kind of follow in line

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.909 
dubbing will kind of follow in line
afterwards<00:03:07.169> and<00:03:08.169> then<00:03:08.290> I'll<00:03:08.379> just<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.709> through

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
afterwards and then I'll just go through

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:16.920 
afterwards and then I'll just go through
the<00:03:09.549> amount<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:09.939> I<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:15.450> make<00:03:16.450> myself<00:03:16.659> a
