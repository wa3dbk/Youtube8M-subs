00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
special once again the second one is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
special once again the second one is
incredibly<00:01:18.840> special<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:20.100> weapon<00:01:20.460> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
incredibly special this weapon can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
incredibly special this weapon can
select<00:01:20.909> between<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.540> different<00:01:21.960> types<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
select between two different types of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.590 
select between two different types of
elemental<00:01:22.830> damage<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
elemental damage so when you get the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
elemental damage so when you get the
murmur<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.229> start<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.799> arc<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
murmur you start out with arc and then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.630 
murmur you start out with arc and then
you<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.320> unlock<00:01:28.320> solar<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> then<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you have to unlock solar and then you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.069 
you have to unlock solar and then you
can<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.970> switch<00:01:30.240> between<00:01:30.450> both<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> those

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
can just switch between both of those

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
can just switch between both of those
it's<00:01:31.320> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> switching<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.310> perks<00:01:32.610> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's kind of like switching up perks in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's kind of like switching up perks in
your<00:01:33.390> subclass<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.610> how<00:01:35.850> you'll<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
your subclass so that's how you'll do it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
your subclass so that's how you'll do it
with<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> murmur<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.579> many

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
with the murmur and there's so many

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
with the murmur and there's so many
applications<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.780> very<00:01:40.140> practical

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
applications you know very practical

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
applications you know very practical
applications<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.310> being<00:01:41.640> able<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.119> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
applications for being able to do that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
applications for being able to do that
and<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.470> switch<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.490> fly

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and you can just switch them on the fly

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.300 
and you can just switch them on the fly
which<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.119> also<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.689> cool<00:01:46.229> can't<00:01:47.009> wait<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
which is also very cool can't wait to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
which is also very cool can't wait to
actually<00:01:47.340> use<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.060> weapon<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> everyone

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
can get it by completing the story so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.639 
can get it by completing the story so
pretty<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.570> everyone<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.380> walking

pretty much everyone will be walking

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.039 
pretty much everyone will be walking
around<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> murmur<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> said<00:01:54.750> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
around with a murmur now like I said you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
around with a murmur now like I said you
can<00:01:55.229> actually<00:01:55.680> upgrade<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.610> evolve<00:01:57.180> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

weapon<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> legendary<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.759> how<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.719> do

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
weapon into a legendary so how you do

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.350 
weapon into a legendary so how you do
that<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.729> modifier<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that is there is kind of a modifier I

that is there is kind of a modifier I
guess<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.659> could<00:02:03.780> say<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.829> seventh

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
guess you could say in the seventh

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.330 
guess you could say in the seventh
category<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.479> 7th<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.350> column<00:02:07.920> down

when you're upgrading the murmur so that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
when you're upgrading the murmur so that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
black wax idols which of course drop

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.490 
black wax idols which of course drop
from<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.890> vex<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.700> once<00:03:03.480> you've<00:03:03.750> evolved

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
from the vex and once you've evolved

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.920 
from the vex and once you've evolved
your<00:03:04.710> murmur<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.370> will<00:03:05.670> look<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:05.940> this

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
your murmur it will look like this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
your murmur it will look like this
so<00:03:07.260> obviously<00:03:08.070> one<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.490> big<00:03:08.640> differences

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
so obviously one of the big differences

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.660 
so obviously one of the big differences
is<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> damage<00:03:10.080> number<00:03:10.740> there<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.370> it's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
is just the damage number there so it's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.530 
is just the damage number there so it's
got<00:03:11.880> 248<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.810> 300<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.310> obviously<00:03:15.030> there's<00:03:15.450> a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
got 248 to 300 so obviously there's a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.360 
got 248 to 300 so obviously there's a
huge<00:03:15.690> difference<00:03:15.930> between<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.710> legend<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
huge difference between the legend the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.070 
huge difference between the legend the
rare<00:03:17.640> version<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.300> legendary<00:03:18.660> version

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
rare version and the legendary version

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.870 
rare version and the legendary version
in<00:03:19.200> terms<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.680> damage<00:03:19.980> number<00:03:20.280> however

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
in terms of that damage number however

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.550 
in terms of that damage number however
the<00:03:21.180> impact<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> charge<00:03:22.050> rate<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.380> mag

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the impact and the charge rate the mag

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.260 
the impact and the charge rate the mag
size<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.640> same<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.240> you

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
size all of that is the same and you

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.140 
size all of that is the same and you
also<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> two<00:03:25.890> same<00:03:26.520> modifiers

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
also have the two same modifiers

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.970 
also have the two same modifiers
especially<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.050> one<00:03:28.200> where<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.650> switch

especially the one where you can switch

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.250 
especially the one where you can switch
elemental<00:03:29.550> damages<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> also<00:03:30.750> gain<00:03:31.230> a
