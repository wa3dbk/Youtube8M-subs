hey guys my name is Annabelle from

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.910 
hey guys my name is Annabelle from
quantum<00:00:08.820> suppliers<00:00:09.180> and<00:00:09.660> today<00:00:10.080> we're<00:00:10.500> happy

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
quantum suppliers and today we're happy

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.040 
quantum suppliers and today we're happy
to<00:00:11.130> unveil<00:00:11.520> the<00:00:11.850> new<00:00:12.060> look<00:00:12.270> for<00:00:12.570> our<00:00:12.660> quantum

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
to unveil the new look for our quantum

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.720 
to unveil the new look for our quantum
fight<00:00:13.260> to<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.890> we're<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.610> an

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
fight to do that we're going to do an

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:30.440 
fight to do that we're going to do an
unboxing<00:00:15.080> so<00:00:16.080> let's<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.590> started<00:00:23.840> crap

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:51.450 

tamperproof<00:00:31.450> label<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.890> let's<00:00:51.190> take<00:00:51.400> a

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
tamperproof label right let's take a
