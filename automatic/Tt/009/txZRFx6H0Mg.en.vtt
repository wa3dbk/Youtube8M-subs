00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
for the past five years I've been

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.110 
for the past five years I've been
investigating<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.370> question<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.879> where

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
investigating this question of where

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.810 
investigating this question of where
good<00:00:06.540> ideas<00:00:06.569> come<00:00:07.290> from<00:00:07.490> it's<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.580> kind<00:00:08.790> of

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
good ideas come from it's a kind of

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.190 
good ideas come from it's a kind of
problem<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> us<00:00:09.960> are

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
problem I think all of us are

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.320 
problem I think all of us are
intrinsically<00:00:10.769> interested<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:12.030> want<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
be more creative we want to come up with

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.519 
be more creative we want to come up with
better<00:00:14.309> ideas<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:15.480> want<00:00:15.690> our<00:00:15.780> organizations

better ideas we want our organizations

to<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.830> more<00:00:17.010> innovative<00:00:17.480> I've<00:00:18.480> looked<00:00:18.779> at

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to be more innovative I've looked at

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689 
to be more innovative I've looked at
this<00:00:18.990> problem<00:00:19.260> from<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.130> environmental

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
this problem from an environmental

this problem from an environmental
perspective<00:00:21.260> what<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> spaces<00:00:22.949> that

perspective what are the spaces that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
perspective what are the spaces that
have<00:00:23.760> historically<00:00:24.300> led<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.720> unusual<00:00:25.170> rates

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
have historically led to unusual rates

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.099 
have historically led to unusual rates
of<00:00:25.619> creativity<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> innovation<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
of creativity and innovation and what I

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
of creativity and innovation and what I
found<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:29.609> systems<00:00:30.060> there<00:00:30.599> are

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
found in all these systems there are

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.450 
found in all these systems there are
these<00:00:30.810> recurring<00:00:31.410> patterns<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.279> see

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
these recurring patterns that you see

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
these recurring patterns that you see
again<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.910> again<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.780> crucial<00:00:34.230> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
again and again that are crucial to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.600 
again and again that are crucial to
creating<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:34.800> environment<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.399> are

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
creating an environment that are

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.479 
creating an environment that are
unusually<00:00:36.059> innovative<00:00:36.620> one<00:00:37.620> pattern<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.190> call

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
unusually innovative one pattern I call

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.299 
unusually innovative one pattern I call
the<00:00:38.610> slow<00:00:38.910> hunch<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.690> breakthrough<00:00:40.649> ideas

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the slow hunch that breakthrough ideas

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
the slow hunch that breakthrough ideas
almost<00:00:41.760> never<00:00:42.090> come<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> moment<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.079> great

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
almost never come in a moment of great

almost never come in a moment of great
insight<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.430> sudden<00:00:44.760> stroke<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
insight in a sudden stroke of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.229 
insight in a sudden stroke of
inspiration<00:00:45.980> most<00:00:46.980> important<00:00:47.610> ideas<00:00:47.969> take<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
inspiration most important ideas take a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
inspiration most important ideas take a
long<00:00:48.539> time<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.289> evolve<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.129> spent<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
long time to evolve and they spent a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.450 
long time to evolve and they spent a
long<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:50.940> dormant<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> background<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
long time dormant in the background it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.279 
long time dormant in the background it
isn't<00:00:53.850> until<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> idea<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.780> had<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.199> or

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
isn't until the idea has had two or

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
isn't until the idea has had two or
three<00:00:55.350> years<00:00:55.800> sometimes<00:00:56.280> 10<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.850> 20<00:00:57.120> years<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
three years sometimes 10 or 20 years to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
three years sometimes 10 or 20 years to
mature<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> suddenly<00:00:58.829> becomes

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
mature that it suddenly becomes

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
mature that it suddenly becomes
accessible<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> useful<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
accessible to you and useful to you in a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
accessible to you and useful to you in a
certain<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> partially

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
certain way and this is partially

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.469 
certain way and this is partially
because<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:05.189> ideas<00:01:05.519> normally<00:01:06.000> come<00:01:06.270> from

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
because good ideas normally come from

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
because good ideas normally come from
the<00:01:06.570> collision<00:01:07.200> between<00:01:07.350> smaller<00:01:07.979> hunches<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the collision between smaller hunches so

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.460 
the collision between smaller hunches so
that<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.450> form<00:01:09.720> something<00:01:09.960> bigger<00:01:10.260> than

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that they form something bigger than

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.179 
that they form something bigger than
themselves

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
themselves

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
themselves
so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> see<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> history<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so you see a lot in the history of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.859 
so you see a lot in the history of
innovation<00:01:13.490> cases<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.640> someone<00:01:15.210> who<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.509> half

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
innovation cases of someone who has half

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.050 
innovation cases of someone who has half
of<00:01:16.080> an<00:01:16.170> idea<00:01:16.470> there's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> great<00:01:17.520> story<00:01:17.759> about

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of an idea there's a great story about

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
of an idea there's a great story about
the<00:01:18.210> invention<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> World<00:01:18.780> Wide<00:01:19.020> Web<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the invention of the World Wide Web and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
the invention of the World Wide Web and
Tim<00:01:19.860> berners-lee<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> project<00:01:21.659> that

Tim berners-lee this is a project that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
Tim berners-lee this is a project that
berners-lee<00:01:22.290> worked<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.130> 10<00:01:23.340> years<00:01:23.759> but

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
berners-lee worked on for 10 years but

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
berners-lee worked on for 10 years but
when<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:24.869> started<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.860> didn't<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> full

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
when he started he didn't have a full

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
when he started he didn't have a full
vision<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.270> new<00:01:27.479> medium<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.170> going

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
vision for this new medium he was going

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.380 
vision for this new medium he was going
to<00:01:28.500> invent<00:01:28.799> he<00:01:29.430> started<00:01:29.820> working<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.180> one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to invent he started working on one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
to invent he started working on one
project<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> side<00:01:31.350> project<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.950> help<00:01:32.040> him

project as a side project to help him

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
project as a side project to help him
organize<00:01:32.400> his<00:01:32.790> own<00:01:32.939> data<00:01:33.210> he<00:01:33.780> scrapped<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
organize his own data he scrapped that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
organize his own data he scrapped that
after<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> couple<00:01:34.920> years<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.549> he<00:01:35.759> started

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
after a couple years and he started

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
after a couple years and he started
working<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.329> another<00:01:36.720> thing<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.680> after

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
working on another thing and only after

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
working on another thing and only after
about<00:01:38.040> 10<00:01:38.460> years<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> full<00:01:39.210> vision<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
about 10 years to the full vision of the

world wide web come into being that is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
world wide web come into being that is
more<00:01:42.990> often<00:01:43.140> than<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.770> ideas<00:01:44.159> happen

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

this<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.180> ideas<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:54.840> form<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
this way is that when ideas take form in

that turns a hunch into a real
breakthrough<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:03.090> another<00:02:03.570> hunch<00:02:03.899> that's

systems that allow those hunches to come
together<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.860> turn<00:02:11.009> into

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
together and turn into

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.670 
together and turn into
something<00:02:11.570> bigger<00:02:11.810> than<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.170> sum<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.410> their

something bigger than the sum of their

something bigger than the sum of their
parts<00:02:13.360> that's<00:02:14.360> why<00:02:14.570> for<00:02:15.140> instance<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
parts that's why for instance the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.170 
parts that's why for instance the
coffeehouse<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.760> age<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
modernism were such engines of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.650 
modernism were such engines of
creativity<00:02:21.950> because<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.940> created<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.420> space

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

where ideas could mingle and swap and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.070 
where ideas could mingle and swap and
create<00:02:26.900> new<00:02:27.080> forms<00:02:28.390> when<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> look<00:02:29.690> at<00:02:29.840> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
and to borrow other people's hunches and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.820 
and to borrow other people's hunches and
combine<00:03:10.880> them<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.239> our<00:03:11.480> hunches<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.050> turn

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
combine them with our hunches and turn

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
combine them with our hunches and turn
them<00:03:13.010> into<00:03:13.130> something<00:03:13.400> new<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:14.320> really<00:03:15.320> has

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
them into something new that really has

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.340 
them into something new that really has
I<00:03:15.890> think<00:03:15.920> been<00:03:16.459> more<00:03:17.000> than<00:03:17.150> anything<00:03:17.330> else<00:03:17.600> the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
I think been more than anything else the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.900 
I think been more than anything else the
primary<00:03:18.830> engine<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.280> creativity<00:03:19.640> and

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
primary engine of creativity and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.150 
primary engine of creativity and
innovation<00:03:20.180> over<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> last<00:03:21.019> 600<00:03:21.560> or<00:03:21.650> 700

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
innovation over the last 600 or 700

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.210 
innovation over the last 600 or 700
years<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.630> yes<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:24.500> true<00:03:24.860> we're<00:03:25.070> more

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
years and so yes it's true we're more

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.699 
years and so yes it's true we're more
distracted<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.660> has<00:03:26.780> happened<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.440> is

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
distracted but what has happened that is

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.830 
distracted but what has happened that is
really<00:03:28.100> miraculous<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.940> marvelous<00:03:29.060> over<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
really miraculous and marvelous over the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.229 
really miraculous and marvelous over the
last<00:03:30.019> 15<00:03:30.470> years<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.040> we<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.090> many

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
last 15 years is that we have so many

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.360 
last 15 years is that we have so many
new<00:03:32.510> ways<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.989> connect<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.010> many<00:03:34.160> new<00:03:34.250> ways

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370
