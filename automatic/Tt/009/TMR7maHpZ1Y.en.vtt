looked like
because<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:35.660> kind<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.080> hard<00:03:36.320> sneaker<00:03:36.800> to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
because it's kind of a hard sneaker to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.650 
because it's kind of a hard sneaker to
just<00:03:37.190> look<00:03:37.310> at<00:03:37.460> pictures<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:37.940> determine

just look at pictures and determine

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.010 
just look at pictures and determine
whether<00:03:39.410> or<00:03:39.530> not<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.670> or<00:03:40.760> not<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.870> it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
whether or not you like it or not but it

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.920 
whether or not you like it or not but it
is<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.410> nice<00:03:43.130> leather<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:44.000> woven<00:03:44.210> leather<00:03:44.510> and

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
is a nice leather the woven leather and

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.360 
is a nice leather the woven leather and
the<00:03:45.800> lace<00:03:46.070> tips<00:03:47.230> do<00:03:48.230> have<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.650> screw<00:03:49.010> on<00:03:49.040> like

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.610 
the lace tips do have the screw on like
a<00:03:49.550> glitz<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.180> think<00:03:50.990> is<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.200> proper<00:03:51.530> term<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
a glitz I think is the proper term it

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.440 
a glitz I think is the proper term it
does<00:03:54.860> have<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.430> aglet<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:58.180> took<00:03:59.180> long<00:03:59.420> enough

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.220 
does have the aglet so took long enough
to<00:03:59.780> focus<00:04:00.520> but<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:02.450> does<00:04:02.660> unscrew<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.780> yeah<00:04:06.020> I

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
to focus but it does unscrew so yeah I

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.050
