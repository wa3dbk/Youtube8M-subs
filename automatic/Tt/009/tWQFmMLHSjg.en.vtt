00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 video as you see this page acs colom and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.870
 is for all those who did the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.330
 counter yes sir if you play the counter 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.660
 You will have true skins so it is worth in this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.550
 page that we do we take the skins os 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 you go to your profile and here will come the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.890
 skins down if you link the account and by 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.189
 example you can make offers offers 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.109
 You are going to your offers, something that I 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.670
 I do not have so I would have to go to trade 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.910
 but I think they do not load my arms if 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.399
 ok you take the weapons boxes or keys and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 selection eyes here and on this side then 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.899
 you will do what I wanted what 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 you want we go then you ask for it in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.760
 prostrate and on the general page 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 things like that of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.950
 left who ask for a good one is in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.950
 one m four progressive guards 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.890
 and people make offers if they have the top 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 off they change it they ask for more 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.730
 things or what they see for the value 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.730
 as for example here that the kid says 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.110
 that gives boxes for anything and 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.530
 knife for money keys or knives 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.340
 real by other knives and so all the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.650
 this time we weigh this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 would be in plan of trade or I give you 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.450
 my skin on another corner and change them 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.040
 and the other part of this page is the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.140
 bets 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.490
 let's say that you bet for a team 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 you bet a skin and if that team wins and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.580
 your bet was high let's say you 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 you wear skins of the value of what you bet 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.820
 this is for example we enter into this 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:56.310
 natick has a 75 victory and he 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:00.750
 value at 0 33 to 1 and l of c 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.730
 is valued at 293 to 1 for example me 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.370
 squared guardian if I bet on na tic 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.730
 it's worth almost five dollars and they would give me 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.080
 weapons valued at 152 if we bet 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.750
 for the d lc my weapon is valued by 13 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.830
 54 then they would give me a weapon value 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.320
 of 13 54 here you can adjust a maximum 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.700
 of 4 more weapons does not let be two euros 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.990
 when you bet because you can not take 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.960
 back the bet when the sap 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.970
 lizbeth and you're going to 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.390
 to a participant of this web page that 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.010
 it takes everything in which once 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.510
 done can not be returned nor to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.850
 we will have to wait for 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.890
 finish the game if you lose you stay 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.810
 without weapons so the bets go already 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 you will know 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.200
 and on this page is all this 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.760
 I would say there is nothing else that has you 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.190
 that explain so all those who 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.670
 have skins over you or look for some 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.120
 skin 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.030
 specifically, you come on this page 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.319
 you look for the skin you want and if there 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.049
 someone who asks for the weapon that you 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.150
 you have and you can change it much more 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.940
 easy I hope you have served this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.409
 tutorial or this web page for all 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.159
 those who play the counter and nothing in their 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.159
