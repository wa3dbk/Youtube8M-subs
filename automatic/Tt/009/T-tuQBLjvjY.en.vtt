00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.490
 Good day to all of us today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.269
 decided to get out into the woods and run 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 material for future bonsai in general 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.420
 if there is a dream near you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.400
 become an inexhaustible source for you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 bonsai materials traditionally 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.699
 stuff for throwing away tears 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.650
 called yamadori 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 but those trees that we are today 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.779
 I plan to start the engine, you can 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.630
 conditionally call 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.340
 I am a real motor this is old trees 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.059
 usually not exceeding 50 centimeters 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.399
 height due to the wind of the sun and cold 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 they get bizarre twisted 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.800
 forms such trees are usually dug up 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.070
 over the years in stages and undermines another 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.510
 today we are planning a horn 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.039
 get relatively young 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.160
 trees that you can dig 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.120
 at one time the agenda we have today 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.059
 a few hundred is our ban of greasy 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
 land of young pines as you see here 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.790
 even a dime a dozen do not dig 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.350
 material and goban sit down just the sea we 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.460
 my wife and I call this place 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.570
 banal field and here it is our first 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 copy start with him 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.090
 first is ready here is our second friend 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:49.390
 who liked us thick trunk 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:49.390
 despite its small land size 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 Julia leave a thought 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.570
 we pack 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.110
 go further 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.870
 notice friends here it is 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.180
 exactly what i 'm talking about my candy 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.520
 bonsai book from european trees 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.380
 of forest 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.450
 one of the drawbacks with 8 taken from 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.640
 of nature is that they have one 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.190
 dominant root and not always succeed 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.200
 get rid of it quickly in order to 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:23.700
 transplant the tree is not high dishes 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:25.110
 any site well here is the earth cop well and live 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.800

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.190

 Well, all the bonsai blanks are planted 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.310
 give them time left 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.070
 year or two adapt to new 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.980
 living conditions and in the meantime can 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.140
 begin to shape up on this 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.440
