always think much of me because of my

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
always think much of me because of my
blonde<00:02:18.110> hair<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.470> how<00:02:18.740> long<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.190> don't<00:02:19.400> know<00:02:19.460> I

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
blonde hair and how long I don't know I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.340 
blonde hair and how long I don't know I
don't<00:02:19.970> know<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.210> it<00:02:20.300> was<00:02:20.450> necessarily<00:02:20.870> blonde

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
don't know if it was necessarily blonde

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.590 
don't know if it was necessarily blonde
part<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.280> think<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> had<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.180> lot<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.570> with

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
part but I think I had a lot to do with

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.690 
part but I think I had a lot to do with
it<00:02:23.750> because<00:02:23.900> once<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.260> cut<00:02:24.440> my<00:02:24.620> hair<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.070> nessa

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it because once I cut my hair I nessa

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340 
it because once I cut my hair I nessa
that<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.240> teachers<00:02:26.630> had<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.960> different

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
that the teachers had a different

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.340 
that the teachers had a different
attitude<00:02:27.440> towards<00:02:28.070> me<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:29.900> seems

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
attitude towards me and it just seems

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.120 
attitude towards me and it just seems
like<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.300> know<00:02:32.300> more<00:02:32.840> respectable<00:02:33.440> person

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
like that I know more respectable person

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.830 
like that I know more respectable person
and<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:36.490> think<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.060> brings<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.660> different

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and I think that it brings a different

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.280 
and I think that it brings a different
confidence<00:02:39.440> level<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:42.140> not

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
confidence level and that I'm not

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.470 
confidence level and that I'm not
dependent<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:45.280> American<00:02:46.280> culture<00:02:46.880> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
dependent on this American culture and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.720 
dependent on this American culture and
in<00:02:47.900> other<00:02:48.050> cultures<00:02:48.320> it's<00:02:48.620> true<00:02:48.800> 20<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.340> long

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
in other cultures it's true 20 this long

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.070 
in other cultures it's true 20 this long
luscious<00:02:50.239> hair<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:52.250> cut<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.750> seems<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> be

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
luscious hair and to cut it seems to be

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.380 
luscious hair and to cut it seems to be
