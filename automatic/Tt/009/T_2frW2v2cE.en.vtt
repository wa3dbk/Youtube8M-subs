we<00:02:46.610> know<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:47.090> your<00:02:47.270> imagination<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.230> can<00:02:48.380> be

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
we know with your imagination it can be

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.729 
we know with your imagination it can be
pushed<00:02:48.770> much<00:02:49.040> further<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:51.140> imagine<00:02:51.590> all

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
pushed much further just imagine all

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.770 
pushed much further just imagine all
those<00:02:52.040> shots<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.520> can<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:52.849> get<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.360> weren't

those shots you can now get that weren't

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.130 
those shots you can now get that weren't
ever<00:02:53.989> before<00:02:54.410> possible

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.170 

we've<00:02:58.710> spent<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.950> lot<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> time<00:02:59.370> developing<00:02:59.640> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
we've spent a lot of time developing the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.270 
we've spent a lot of time developing the
software<00:03:00.360> side<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.050> genie<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.950> wanted<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
software side of the genie we wanted to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.010 
software side of the genie we wanted to
make<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.670> easy<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.000> use<00:03:03.090> as<00:03:03.240> possible<00:03:03.840> and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
make it as easy to use as possible and

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.200 
make it as easy to use as possible and
this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.740> key<00:03:04.890> features<00:03:05.100> if<00:03:05.640> you

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210
