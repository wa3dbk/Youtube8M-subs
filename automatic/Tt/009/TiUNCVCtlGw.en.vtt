00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
okay so we used our 13 to hold on to

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.610 
okay so we used our 13 to hold on to
this<00:00:42.079> there<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.600> metal<00:00:44.600> stopper<00:00:45.320> here<00:00:45.500> to

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
this there is a metal stopper here to

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.740 
this there is a metal stopper here to
prevent<00:00:45.950> this<00:00:46.070> from<00:00:46.129> moving<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.329> as<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:47.600> gets

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
prevent this from moving but as it gets

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.569 
prevent this from moving but as it gets
loose<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.140> will<00:00:48.170> move<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.800> 13<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.399> hold

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
loose it will move so the 13 to hold

zero<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.800> then<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:41.480> not<00:02:41.690> going<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.900> work

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
zero for then it's not going to work

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.790 
zero for then it's not going to work
very<00:02:42.050> well<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:43.780> you'll<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.380> comes<00:02:45.620> in

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
very well so you'll see that it comes in

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.460 
very well so you'll see that it comes in
between<00:02:45.920> your<00:02:46.310> two<00:02:46.580> cooling<00:02:47.000> lines<00:02:47.470> then

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
between your two cooling lines then

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.930 
between your two cooling lines then
there<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> little<00:02:49.930> bracket<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.940> that

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
there is a little bracket in here that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240 
there is a little bracket in here that
it<00:02:53.120> goes<00:02:53.300> through<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:53.960> up<00:02:54.710> on<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.070> right

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
it goes through then up on the right

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.900 
it goes through then up on the right
side<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.660> neck<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.320> then<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.400> between

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
side of the neck and then in between

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.570 
side of the neck and then in between
your<00:02:59.060> cluster<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.750> then<00:03:00.350> out<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.250> kind

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
your cluster and then out so just kind

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.390 
your cluster and then out so just kind
of<00:03:01.700> run<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.810> same<00:03:03.050> way<00:03:04.450> okay<00:03:06.160> back<00:03:07.160> off

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
of run it the same way okay back off

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.170 
of run it the same way okay back off
this<00:03:07.640> nut<00:03:07.880> all<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.510> way<00:03:09.460> push<00:03:10.460> your<00:03:10.730> cable<00:03:11.090> in

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
this nut all the way push your cable in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.150 
this nut all the way push your cable in
as<00:03:11.360> far<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.600> it'll<00:03:11.900> go<00:03:11.930> that'll<00:03:12.860> give<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
as far as it'll go that'll give you a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.950 
as far as it'll go that'll give you a
lot<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.430> room<00:03:13.670> over<00:03:13.790> here<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.360> really<00:03:14.810> easily

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
lot of room over here to really easily

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.410 
lot of room over here to really easily
put<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.280> get<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.580> in<00:03:16.700> here<00:03:16.970> get<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.300> in

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
put it in so get it in here get it in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420 
put it in so get it in here get it in
here<00:03:17.630> right<00:03:17.800> don't<00:03:18.800> worry<00:03:19.040> about<00:03:19.130> any

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
here right don't worry about any

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.950 
here right don't worry about any
adjustments<00:03:20.030> here<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.270> this<00:03:20.420> point<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.810> time

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
adjustments here at this point in time

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.960 
adjustments here at this point in time
we<00:03:21.560> got<00:03:21.710> to<00:03:21.830> do<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.070> top<00:03:22.250> at<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.460> lever<00:03:22.730> now

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
we got to do the top at the lever now

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.560 
we got to do the top at the lever now
you<00:03:23.960> got<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.290> apart<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:24.970> take<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.120> time<00:03:26.300> and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
you got it apart so take the time and

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.420 
you got it apart so take the time and
lube<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.230> cable<00:03:29.560> okay<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.740> we<00:03:31.070> got<00:03:31.250> this

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
lube the cable okay so we got this

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.360 
lube the cable okay so we got this
button<00:03:31.730> back<00:03:31.970> up<00:03:32.320> put<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.440> back<00:03:33.680> back<00:03:33.950> this

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
button back up put that back back this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.700 
button back up put that back back this
back<00:03:34.640> on<00:03:34.850> don't<00:03:35.510> over<00:03:35.870> tighten<00:03:36.050> this<00:03:36.290> because

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 
back on don't over tighten this because

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.040 
back on don't over tighten this because
then<00:03:36.920> your<00:03:37.460> lever<00:03:37.700> will<00:03:37.970> actually<00:03:38.420> seize

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
then your lever will actually seize

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.680 
then your lever will actually seize
because<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.040> will<00:03:40.190> clamp<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.670> lever<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.570> you

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
because it will clamp the lever so you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.960 
because it will clamp the lever so you
can<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.020> my<00:03:42.170> clutch<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.560> completely<00:03:43.040> loose<00:03:43.220> we

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
can see my clutch is completely loose we

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.280 
can see my clutch is completely loose we
now<00:03:44.090> go<00:03:44.270> to<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.480> bottom<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:45.050> do<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
now go to the bottom to do the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.700 
now go to the bottom to do the
adjustment<00:03:45.910> okay<00:03:46.910> you'll<00:03:47.090> see<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.900> process

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
adjustment okay you'll see the process

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.770 
adjustment okay you'll see the process
is<00:03:48.890> not<00:03:49.010> very<00:03:49.070> high-tech<00:03:49.670> pull<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.420> cable

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
is not very high-tech pull the cable

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.920 
is not very high-tech pull the cable
here<00:03:51.050> until<00:03:51.380> it's<00:03:51.530> tight<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:52.100> then<00:03:53.030> until<00:03:53.810> it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
here until it's tight and then until it

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.770 
here until it's tight and then until it
seems<00:03:54.140> tight<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.740> then<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.510> walk<00:03:56.510> these

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
seems tight and then just walk these

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.530 
seems tight and then just walk these
together<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:58.460> is<00:03:58.670> just<00:03:58.880> rudimentary<00:03:59.390> at

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
together this is just rudimentary at

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.870 
together this is just rudimentary at
this<00:03:59.660> point<00:03:59.900> in<00:03:59.960> time<00:04:00.110> it's<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.610> finely<00:04:01.610> tuned

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
this point in time it's not finely tuned

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.160 
this point in time it's not finely tuned
there<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:03.410> we're<00:04:03.830> going<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:05.020> little<00:04:06.020> bit

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
there so we're going to a little bit

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.610 
there so we're going to a little bit
more<00:04:06.550> okay<00:04:07.550> that's<00:04:07.730> good<00:04:08.230> perfect<00:04:09.230> now<00:04:09.500> we're

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
more okay that's good perfect now we're

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.270 
more okay that's good perfect now we're
going<00:04:09.710> to<00:04:09.770> go<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.040> check<00:04:10.160> our<00:04:10.340> lever<00:04:12.130> okay<00:04:13.130> I

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
going to go and check our lever okay I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.620 
going to go and check our lever okay I
got<00:04:13.520> a<00:04:13.550> little<00:04:13.640> bit<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.000> play<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.240> need<00:04:14.540> about

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
got a little bit of play you need about

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.620 
got a little bit of play you need about
enough<00:04:14.990> play<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.290> there<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.560> put<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.740> quarter<00:04:16.130> in

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
enough play in there to put a quarter in

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.880 
enough play in there to put a quarter in
here<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.780> put<00:04:17.960> a<00:04:17.989> wedge<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.290> quarter<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:18.770> there

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
here to put a wedge a quarter in there

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.620 
here to put a wedge a quarter in there
that's<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.190> much<00:04:19.280> play<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.609> want<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.420> that's

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that's so much play you want and that's

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.490 
that's so much play you want and that's
actually<00:04:20.900> roughly<00:04:22.720> how<00:04:23.720> much<00:04:23.840> play<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.170> have

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
actually roughly how much play I have

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.630 
actually roughly how much play I have
right<00:04:24.770> now<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.660> I'm<00:04:26.660> pretty<00:04:26.900> good<00:04:27.490> I'm<00:04:28.490> going

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
right now so I'm pretty good I'm going

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.000 
right now so I'm pretty good I'm going
to<00:04:28.700> back<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.120> off<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.660> touch<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.800> is

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
to back it off just a touch and this is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.560 
to back it off just a touch and this is
where<00:04:31.160> your<00:04:31.280> fine-tuning<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:31.940> going<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.150> be

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.550 

all<00:04:35.570> right<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.870> then<00:04:36.140> we<00:04:36.200> got<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.440> back

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
all right and then we got it back

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.430 
all right and then we got it back
together<00:04:37.030> got<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.060> little<00:04:38.270> bit<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.479> play

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
together got a little bit of play

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.210 
together got a little bit of play
and<00:04:39.700> works<00:04:40.700> good<00:04:41.530> done<00:04:42.700> 20<00:04:43.700> minutes<00:04:44.000> tops
