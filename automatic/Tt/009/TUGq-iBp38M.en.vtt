00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.470
 my name is rosie I'm 16 years old 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 it's my second year in the center of 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.660
 nantes training ground basketball 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.310
 I was injured in January 2012 knee 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 I have cruciate ligaments I am in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.189
 re-learning phase since about 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.009
 three months to resume in a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.250
 week a re-learning phase 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.199
 it's a phase is straddling between the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 end of rehabilitation and recovery 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.609
 100% training a recovery and a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 back to the competition 1st category c 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.769
 proprioception exercises that this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.929
 either on the floor on the waf in all 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.480
 case he will have to put his body in 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.280
 difficulty that they are used to this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 kind of thing to basketball because there 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 will have contacts the second type 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.109
 of exercise was about strengthening 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 muscle of course that this is the 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.620
 squat whether it's a duvet that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.239
 it is the bench press disco soul 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 January the quadriceps 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 of course belt reinforcement 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.240
 abdominal with a lot of cladding 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.369
 a lot of sheathing on 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.439
 balloons on swiss ball bullish a lot 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 of medicine ball manipulations also 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.030
 and the third criterion was good 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.280
 heard the maximum aerobic power and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
 explosiveness where that was the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 most difficult exercises for for 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.229
 rose since she was running out of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.759
 breath in physics course that's right 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.229
 that at first she was very reluctant 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 to do them so there are less 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.570
 of intensity enchained spirit flagship all 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.340
 what are you so 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.200
 it's frustration all the time 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.909
 to say to ourselves we have no more breath we have more 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.740
 of fitness one starts from scratch 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.840
 as if we had just been born to hold 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.580
 mentally really hard because I'm there 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.950
 think again that will still remain in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.360
 create for a while it's not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.510
 so easy to move on even 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.880
 if we have very satisfactory results 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.950
 and everyone tell you that it's okay 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.100
 always has this apprehension of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.040
 to tell ourselves that his place makes us 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.170
 can leave again that he is finally a 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 operation it's betting the scars 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.460
 will stay for life so will always be 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.460
 anchored and it's not easy and I think 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.820
 that I'm going to take a long time to get to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.709
 something else during my re-learning 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 I missed the game the most it was 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.310
 a team does when we play the pleasure 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.560
 to play 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.840
 finally basketball itself because 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.110
 it's still a collective sport and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.440
 see her teammates play complaining 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.820
 coaches and you be his side by train 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.660
 to tell you you'd like to do that but 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.370
 do not realize it 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.230
 the fact also that she does not go 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.820
 account of the gravity of this kind of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.870
 injury that psychologically it's 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.640
 still hard enough to live 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.019
 I do not feel isolated either 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.190
 because I still second year 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.440
 I knew where most 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.090
 girls were there after yes there is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.640
 always differences fringe rest 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.019
 nevertheless the new nets me 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.200
 do not know my never seen do of 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.540
 basketball finally she imagine l it that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.280
 that what she sees you the problem 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.049
 is that what she sees is not 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.959
 between lee but the reality finally I am 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.610
 faded maximum capacity so that's 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.140
 still frustrating for me yet 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.730
 but until I resume 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.090
 I will always have a difference because 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.379
 that I'm not training 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.590
 to have support is always 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.060
 important especially in this kind of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.069
 situation and at my age even more the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.780
 physical presenter you encourage yourself 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.830
 request to surpass you after that is sure 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.129
 that it's boring days ago where 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.440
 it's boring because it's not 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.049
 there and that psychologically even if we 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.840
 is encouraged all non life is not there 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.690
 because there is tired but after yes 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.379
 for sure it's really a 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.730
 more 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.560
 finally it's either physically 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.630
 psychologically you have to be very 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.910
 listened to the sportsman when he does the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.390
 exercises to return to his level or 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.620
 even bodybuilding exercises from 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.220
 muscle building or anything 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.640
 what else 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.450
 whether they are injured or not because 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.040
 hide according to what he will say 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.870
 according to his feelings he goes 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.040
 have to modulate the intensity of exercise 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.540
 it will have to change sometimes 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.400
 completely exercise and I 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.349
 to decorate as much as possible of the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.360
 ball games even if it was not 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.069
 obvious to find any time but 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.870
 I tried to bring more things 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.549
 in addition says for its part the most 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.350
 possible you still have to shoot him 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.670
 my hat because doing that while 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.230
 these cuts you need basketball next 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.870
 it's far from easy 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.290
 what make sure that rose is 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.290
 really strong
