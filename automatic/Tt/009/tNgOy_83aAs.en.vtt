and<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.909> result<00:00:31.239> of<00:00:31.329> that<00:00:31.390> people<00:00:31.960> get<00:00:32.110> very

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and a result of that people get very

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.280 
and a result of that people get very
important<00:00:33.880> because<00:00:34.030> we're<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.630> ones<00:00:34.930> that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
important because we're the ones that

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.760 
important because we're the ones that
have<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:36.070> wait<00:00:36.580> stay<00:00:36.880> in<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.480> schooling<00:00:37.810> lens

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
have to wait stay in the schooling lens

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.580 
have to wait stay in the schooling lens
so<00:00:39.160> it's<00:00:39.400> like<00:00:39.640> if<00:00:39.940> it's<00:00:40.570> our<00:00:40.930> needs<00:00:41.380> like

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
so it's like if it's our needs like

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.870 
so it's like if it's our needs like
because<00:00:41.770> these<00:00:41.860> teachers<00:00:42.130> don't<00:00:42.550> know<00:00:42.670> what

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
because these teachers don't know what

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040 
because these teachers don't know what
we<00:00:43.030> want<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.590> we<00:00:45.010> need<00:00:45.190> our<00:00:45.370> opinion<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:46.900> is

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
we want so we need our opinion so it is

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.240 
we want so we need our opinion so it is
there<00:00:47.290> for<00:00:47.320> us<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:50.230> it's<00:00:50.440> important<00:00:51.070> that

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
there for us I think it's important that

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.090 
there for us I think it's important that
we<00:00:51.280> get<00:00:52.110> people<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.230> listen<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.620> us<00:00:53.650> because<00:00:53.860> we

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
we get people to listen to us because we

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.250 
we get people to listen to us because we
know<00:00:54.280> what<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.640> want<00:00:54.670> in<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.000> score<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.570> like

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
know what we want in the score and like

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.900 
know what we want in the score and like
two<00:00:56.440> teachers<00:00:56.650> maybe<00:00:57.070> know<00:00:57.310> what<00:00:57.490> they<00:00:57.640> want

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
two teachers maybe know what they want

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.520 
two teachers maybe know what they want
but<00:00:58.210> we<00:00:58.390> know<00:00:58.570> what<00:00:58.690> we<00:00:58.840> want<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.200> we're<00:00:59.380> the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
but we know what we want and we're the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.800 
but we know what we want and we're the
ones<00:00:59.620> learning<00:00:59.980> at<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.400> end<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> day<00:01:00.970> by

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
ones learning at the end of the day by

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.319 
ones learning at the end of the day by
improving<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.560> design<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.100> school<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:04.180> all

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
improving to design in school it all

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.359 
improving to design in school it all
maybe<00:01:04.570> last<00:01:04.839> longer<00:01:05.259> because<00:01:05.409> less<00:01:06.340> people

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
maybe last longer because less people

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.359 
maybe last longer because less people
have<00:01:07.149> less<00:01:07.749> vandalism<00:01:08.499> on<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.740> because<00:01:08.979> it's

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
have less vandalism on it because it's

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.789
