00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.569
 a house built on track 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.750
 above massive threat below large-scale window facade 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.310
 in northeastern Switzerland with a view of Lake Constance 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.419
 Heike and Claudia Ostmann have their ideas of the perfect litter 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.610
 realized 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.970
 Welcome to Manuel the first one the Briton 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.120
 since 2007, the Roosters lay in the villa 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.540
 350 square meters of living space plus 400 square meters of garden terrace 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 Client and architect Heiko Ostmann 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.230
 discovered the property six years ago and shared the house with 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.710
 designed his architectural office 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.220
 the basic idea was to build a building 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.230
 which totally connects landscape and interior and therefore we have that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.160
 was developed on the ground floor which creates an ideal space and interior 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.080
 Executions always to let go over the day with the view of the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 Lake Constance and then we have the view of the garden 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.670
 SID 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.500
 the ground floor is fully glazed the massive upper floor is narrow 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.040
 slanted steel columns are worn to look outside 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 not understand as possible 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.060
 take these 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 see 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.270
 January 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.980
 in the lower level of the building complex is the 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.080
 Architecture office housed by Heiko Buschmann 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.510
 biblical proportions still many generous windows overlook the view 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 Lake Constance Friday 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.870
 DAPD 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.140
 the architect scored the opposite goals in the residential building 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.550
 implemented 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.650
 Here it was important for us and to generate proven forms of use 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's go unnoticed from the outside percent to the floor to sleep around 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.590
 Having voters and having that and that's why we have very little 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.830
 For example, a glass with only this small opening of the new 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.690
 Law Stückemarkt certainly not let in but from Bietenhausen and from 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.209
 really impossible to do inside out 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.930
 but also the upper floor he finds himself to the lake with a big one 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.519
 picture window 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.799
 here is the bedroom with 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.799
 Langenhain 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.629
 the interior design as little as possible compete with the landscape 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.839
 the minimalist furniture consists of these classics 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.279
 matching the color scheme once dominated the entire house 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.049
 to float in space for the critical questions 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.239
 Contrasts put Heiko and Claudio Austmann with three other films 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.529
 want to mentioned 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.260
 as a resident 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.219
 Karmann was only for the 1 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.099
 Push the aben 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.399
 in percent of the second round will be filmed in Dannenberg until last days 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.249
 Surprised, the comparison does not match 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.189
 the ex-bremer will be in ten years a first defeat to «Der Spiegel» 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.109
 and the thing's simplest means ever accepted 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.290
 for the group games 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.590
 what the plot that the architecture of the house board 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:45.109
 The building should fit into the picturesque landscape 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.129
 when I entered the property the first time 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.629
 Softly fascinated by the sight of the landscape I realized immediately that is 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.429
 Here in Villingen value for one 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.609
 Place to create 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.149
 The 4 for a long time manages to fascinate me and has until today 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.400
 absolutely stopped because in fact that's how it is 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.779
 that the change of seasons 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.949
 and the change picture of the weather a totally fascinating setting behind the 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.609
 forming 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.049
 a backdrop that looks like Hypo and Claudius every day again
