kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> low<00:00:30.390> quality<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> size

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
kind of low quality because of the size

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.930 
kind of low quality because of the size
of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> clip<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.279> hopefully<00:00:32.640> you'll<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.820> able
