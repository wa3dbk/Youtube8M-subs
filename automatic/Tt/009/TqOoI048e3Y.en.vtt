did<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.670> blend<00:02:00.090> whatsoever<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.280> don't<00:02:02.280> know<00:02:02.369> if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
did not blend whatsoever I don't know if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.539 
did not blend whatsoever I don't know if
it<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.179> the<00:02:03.979> closure<00:02:04.979> being<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
it was because of the closure being so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
it was because of the closure being so
short<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.080> not<00:02:07.200> meshing<00:02:07.619> well

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
short and it's just not meshing well

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
short and it's just not meshing well
together<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> crow<00:02:09.390> pattern

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
together but just like the crow pattern

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
together but just like the crow pattern
was<00:02:10.019> different<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:11.190> will<00:02:11.400> show<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.640> God<00:02:11.910> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
was different and I will show you God I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670 
was different and I will show you God I

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
for you guys of the how the hair look

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.150 
for you guys of the how the hair look
when<00:02:15.750> i<00:02:15.810> first<00:02:16.049> received<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.739> i<00:02:16.769> finished

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
when i first received it when i finished

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370 
when i first received it when i finished
the<00:02:17.340> unit<00:02:17.700> i'm<00:02:18.239> actually<00:02:18.540> trying<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.049> take<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the unit i'm actually trying to take a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.570 
the unit i'm actually trying to take a
picture<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.950> hair<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.160> its<00:02:20.430> natural

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
picture with the hair and its natural

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.270 
picture with the hair and its natural
state<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:22.019> i<00:02:22.049> will<00:02:22.350> not<00:02:22.380> be<00:02:22.620> walking<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.040> its

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
state but i will not be walking in its

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
state but i will not be walking in its
natural<00:02:23.370> state<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.970> i<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.090> can't<00:02:24.480> get<00:02:24.600> with

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
natural state so i just can't get with

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.710 
natural state so i just can't get with
the<00:02:25.019> curl<00:02:25.350> pattern<00:02:26.000> meshing<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.480> i

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
the curl pattern meshing like that i

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750 
the curl pattern meshing like that i
like<00:02:27.959> something<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> flow<00:02:28.739> really<00:02:28.980> nicely<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
like something to flow really nicely and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.210 
like something to flow really nicely and
I<00:02:30.209> that's<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.750> thing-<00:02:30.989> thing<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.980> didn't

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
I that's one thing- thing that I didn't

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.580 
I that's one thing- thing that I didn't
notice<00:02:32.310> about<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:33.200> overall<00:02:34.200> though<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
notice about that overall though the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.840 
notice about that overall though the
hair<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.190> really<00:02:35.400> course<00:02:35.959> it's<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.260> thick

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
hair is really course it's really thick

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.080 
hair is really course it's really thick
the<00:02:39.410> this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.560> length<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.790> closure

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the this is the length of the closure

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.089 
the this is the length of the closure
right<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.380> did<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:43.920> add

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
right here so what I did was just add

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.110 
right here so what I did was just add
some<00:02:44.130> face-framing<00:02:44.790> layers<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:47.090> when<00:02:48.090> I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
some face-framing layers and so when I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.410 
some face-framing layers and so when I
like<00:02:48.390> brush<00:02:48.630> your<00:02:48.810> bag<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:50.040> soft<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
like brush your bag is really soft and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
like brush your bag is really soft and
you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.200> nice<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.190> added

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
you know just really nice so I added

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.900 
you know just really nice so I added
some<00:02:53.910> layers<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.480> both<00:02:54.690> sides<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.590> yeah<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
some layers on both sides and yeah and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.599 
some layers on both sides and yeah and
then<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.239> moved<00:02:57.720> my<00:02:57.959> hair<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.400> want

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
then I just moved my hair like if I want

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.190 
then I just moved my hair like if I want
to<00:02:59.670> side<00:02:59.850> part<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> move<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.690> over<00:03:00.840> some

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
to side part I can move it over some

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.009 
to side part I can move it over some
more<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.829> wanted<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.640> be<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.630> over<00:03:03.930> this

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
more if I wanted to be more so over this

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.660 
more if I wanted to be more so over this
way<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:04.590> scoot<00:03:04.829> over<00:03:05.130> some<00:03:05.310> more<00:03:05.459> like

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
way I can just scoot over some more like

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.460 
way I can just scoot over some more like
that<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.660> that's<00:03:06.750> pretty<00:03:06.989> much<00:03:07.079> what<00:03:07.440> i

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

did use that to semi web so I'm not
having<00:03:45.630> any<00:03:45.720> shedding<00:03:46.109> I'm<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.920> was<00:03:47.100> having<00:03:47.370> a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
having any shedding I'm I was having a

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.710 
having any shedding I'm I was having a
little<00:03:47.639> bit<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.120> think<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.420> might<00:03:48.690> have

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
little bit but I think that might have

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.400 
little bit but I think that might have
been<00:03:48.840> more<00:03:49.079> so

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
been more so

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.930 
been more so
because<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.710> was<00:03:49.740> in<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.370> out<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.580> hair<00:03:50.760> with

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
because I was in and out the hair with

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.760 
because I was in and out the hair with

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
more than that and it gives me this I

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.680 
more than that and it gives me this I
did<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.220> eliminate<00:04:02.580> all<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.390> waves

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
did not eliminate all of the waves

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.540 
did not eliminate all of the waves
because<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.590> still<00:04:04.800> see<00:04:05.070> like<00:04:05.310> there's

because you can still see like there's
some<00:04:05.730> texture<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.420> hair<00:04:06.450> still<00:04:07.220> because<00:04:08.220> I

almost mimics 24-inch they do have many
varieties<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.630> choose<00:04:51.660> from<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.890> don't

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
varieties to choose from so you don't
