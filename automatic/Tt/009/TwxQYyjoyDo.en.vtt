that will help close it in for me I'm

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
that will help close it in for me I'm
only<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.399> here

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
only going to do a little bit right here

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
only going to do a little bit right here
on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> wet<00:00:47.969> line<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:49.110> good<00:00:49.260> trick<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> use

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
on the wet line and a good trick to use

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
on the wet line and a good trick to use
if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> guys<00:00:50.100> pull<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.879> probably

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you guys pull down you're probably

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
if you guys pull down you're probably
going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.390> wrinkles<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
going to get wrinkles so you really

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.569 
going to get wrinkles so you really
don't<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> kind

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
don't want to do that if you just kind

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
don't want to do that if you just kind
of<00:00:53.640> push<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> opens<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.590> flap<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
of push it kind of opens up that flap so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
of push it kind of opens up that flap so
you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.670> reach<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> accurately<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> apply

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you can reach it accurately and apply

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.030 
you can reach it accurately and apply
the<00:00:58.289> liner<00:00:58.649> and<00:01:03.260> when<00:01:04.260> I'm<00:01:04.350> doing<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.920> like

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the liner and when I'm doing this I like

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
the liner and when I'm doing this I like
to<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.519> opposite<00:01:05.939> direction<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to look in the opposite direction so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.149 
to look in the opposite direction so
that<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.380> look<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> pencil

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
