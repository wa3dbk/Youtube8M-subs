00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
can see here it is and it works it does
take<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.909> while<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.540> figure<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
take a while to figure out how to do it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
take a while to figure out how to do it
once<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> hang<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> it'll<00:01:12.810> work

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
once you get the hang of it it'll work

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.530 
once you get the hang of it it'll work
all<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.130> basically<00:01:14.549> let's<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.030> go

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
all the time so basically let's just go

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
all the time so basically let's just go
through<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.170> steps<00:01:16.350> again<00:01:16.590> until<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
through the steps again until we go and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
through the steps again until we go and
just<00:01:17.970> prove<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.890> of
