pen these are those pens that you push
down<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.420> tip<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:08.070> paint<00:04:08.459> starts<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
down on the tip and the paint starts to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.910 
down on the tip and the paint starts to
flow<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.989> should<00:04:10.200> be<00:04:10.320> good<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.769> be<00:04:10.890> a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
flow so it should be good but can be a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.229 
flow so it should be good but can be a
little<00:04:11.040> bit<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.310> challenge<00:04:11.880> because<00:04:12.030> with

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
little bit of a challenge because with

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.640 
little bit of a challenge because with
these<00:04:12.390> it's<00:04:12.660> hard<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:13.050> back<00:04:13.260> over<00:04:13.290> your

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
these it's hard to go back over your

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.380

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
spots when you're filling in color so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.060 
spots when you're filling in color so
I've<00:04:16.049> used<00:04:16.109> them<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> lot<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.680> my<00:04:16.859> surfboard

I've used them a lot on my surfboard
work<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.820> past<00:04:18.030> when<00:04:18.270> I've<00:04:18.330> been<00:04:18.390> doing

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
work in the past when I've been doing

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.020 
work in the past when I've been doing
detailed<00:04:18.810> surfboards<00:04:19.680> for<00:04:19.830> folks<00:04:20.100> pretty

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
detailed surfboards for folks pretty

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.830 
detailed surfboards for folks pretty
comfortable<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.510> this

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
comfortable with this

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.960 
comfortable with this
a<00:04:21.870> pen<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.500> lasts<00:04:22.800> forever<00:04:23.220> even<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
a pen and it lasts forever even in the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.760 
a pen and it lasts forever even in the
salt<00:04:24.180> water<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.630> I'm<00:04:24.750> thinking<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.530> is<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
salt water so I'm thinking this is the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.070 
salt water so I'm thinking this is the
right<00:04:25.919> medium<00:04:26.330> worst-case<00:04:27.330> scenario<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.810> sand

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
right medium worst-case scenario I sand

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.409 
right medium worst-case scenario I sand
it<00:04:28.199> repaint<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.949> start<00:04:29.430> fresh<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:30.060> still<00:04:30.300> works

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it repaint it start fresh it still works

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.780 
it repaint it start fresh it still works
