00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.979
 start with this different system but it is 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.190
 Only mine here are you. Every one of you. 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:15.920
 my normal return here is because 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 I already installed the android 4.4.2 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.110
 I'm still going to record a tutorial 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.700
 teaching how to install android 4.4.2 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 the android of the bike is just waiting for a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.780
 little is it will start normally 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 to settle 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.540
 wait a little bit 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 continue with tim 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.670
 It's going to take a little bit but anything. 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.750
 that it is taking time 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.750
 it's normal, okay 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:32.620
 Anything else you can there again. 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:38.860
 l is only took place to play delay 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:50.350
 much in the output take the battery in which 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:52.500
 puts the alloy will usually turn the 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:59.170
 My reminding you that mine is different. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:05.650
 because andrade it to android vote 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:09.990
 4.4 Portuguese even though I'm still going 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.990
 and tutorials is not 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.860
 and now it will usually start 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:05:00.650
 its remembering that it will start from 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.660
 another way my here it's there you go there 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.120
 on android you will have to create one 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.400
 create an account 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:17.440
 you can create an account if you already 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.440
 have you can make it animals now 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:31.400
 There you go, skip it and start it. 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:34.070
 the next is now wait a little if 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:41.830
 you have the card you will find the 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.830
