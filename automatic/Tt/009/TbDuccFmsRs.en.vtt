00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi friends today we are going to ride or 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
 install a chroma key or green background to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 our videos and what do we need then 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.820
 very easy a chroma key and this is the one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.210
 I received today it cost me 21 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.539
 euros roughly 28 dollars and measures 180 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 x 280 and where we will put it then very 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 easy, the cheapest and simplest is a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.609
 roll store that is like this this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 it measures 2 10 by 190 good the tall 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.330
 it will practically give us the same but 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.250
 this mechanism is very simple the truth 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.289
 that are very good are a rope with what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.479
 that is going to roll in a mechanism there 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.639
 can see and when stretching a fall and at 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:42.089
 stretch another one because then it goes up what we're going 

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:45.539
 to do is remove the fabric of this blind 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.949
 how good is very good but in this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.120
 case with normal clear because we have 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.940
 to put our chroma or green fund 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.709
 It has a double-sided adhesive that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.930
 removes very well we just have to 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:01.540
 go stretching we are taking off 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.809
 and he retires we are left with the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.330
 mechanism we remove the tube and we have 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.520
 have a double layer adhesive 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 just as there is in fact the one that there is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.650
 we will be worth to say let's fix the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030
 first hook point 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.510
 well there we have already fixed the first 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.540
 point hook we go around and there 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.240
 let's put our duct tape 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.850
 double layer let's put it has to be 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.750
 obviously longer than that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.940
 be the chroma there we see there goes pegadito 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 Well, we 're going to put it in the part of 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.600
 above it there 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.119
 in this I think it was four meters and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.450
 as the chroma measures 180 because it was more than 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.420
 We cut and cut 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.560
 well there we press well well attached to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.570
 one of the layers and now we're going to withdraw 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.720
 the cover is to leave the part 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.490
 adhesive then to the air and to be able to stick 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.579
 our fabric 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.040
 and we already have the adhesive part in the air and 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.890
 we are hitting very carefully that 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.979
 is well well stretched they do not have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 wrinkles that even we are going that it is 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.500
 perfect because if it goes bad this goes 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.269
 to make the roll up then stay 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.599
 bad also turn to turn 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.069
 because we are going to place it as it was 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.040
 you see the ropes are left 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.360
 so nothing then we put there 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.920
 we hook that side that goes well and this 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.830
 well, it 's super simple 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.319
 we simply enter through the guide and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.110
 we put the insurance and so it does not come out 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.170
 well this is the weight that went down the 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.780
 another blind and the chroma is ready 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.930
 with let's say the hole to put it like that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.600
 Well, I put it in there and you can see there 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.200
 how up and down rolls up perfectly and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.209
 we have replaced our old shade with 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.920
 a background chroma green background and here you have 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.090
 there it is then let's make the change 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 the wilderness as 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.620
 we can also go to the snow or also 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.480
 we can take a trip in time to 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060
 past or at 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.790
 future this gives many possibilities 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.069
 to our videos and I hope that I have 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.640
 like you get as much profit as I do and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.799
 nothing you already know how to comment 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.310
 favorites and see you guys until 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.310
 next week
