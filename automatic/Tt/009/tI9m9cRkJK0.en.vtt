you where all the spawn points are

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.929 
you where all the spawn points are
because<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> pieces<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.400> several

because two of the pieces have several

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.029 
because two of the pieces have several
different<00:00:21.090> locations<00:00:21.470> now<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:22.769> piece

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
different locations now the first piece

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.310

you're going to want to get as Magnus's
brain<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.010> always<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.269> spawn<00:00:27.960> room

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
brain and it's always in the spawn room

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
brain and it's always in the spawn room
where<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.410> start<00:00:28.859> always<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:29.460> round<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.910> it's

where you start always in round one it's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.820 
where you start always in round one it's
always<00:00:30.720> sitting<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> table

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
always sitting right there on the table

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.900 
always sitting right there on the table
that<00:00:32.070> you're<00:00:32.219> looking<00:00:32.520> at<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:35.520> always

that you're looking at now it always

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850 
that you're looking at now it always
spawns<00:00:36.210> there<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.750> never<00:00:36.809> spawns<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.620> any

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
spawns there it never spawns in any

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
spawns there it never spawns in any
location<00:00:38.040> other<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> room<00:00:39.989> other

location other in the in this room other
than<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.559> table<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.730> probably<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
than that table so it's probably the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
than that table so it's probably the
easiest<00:00:42.629> piece<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> find

of<00:00:44.329> Maxis<00:00:45.329> drone<00:00:45.829> now<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> other<00:00:47.070> two<00:00:47.309> pieces

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
of Maxis drone now the other two pieces

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
of Maxis drone now the other two pieces
are<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> separate<00:00:48.300> locations<00:00:48.770> ones<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.950> by

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
are in separate locations ones out by

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.240 
are in separate locations ones out by
generator<00:00:50.430> six<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
generator six and the other one is in a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
generator six and the other one is in a
different<00:00:53.489> location<00:00:53.670> also<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.719> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
different location also out there now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.660 
different location also out there now
the<00:00:55.379> picture<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.039> screen<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the picture you see on screen is the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.910 
the picture you see on screen is the
centerpiece<00:00:57.210> Maxis<00:00:57.750> drone<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
centerpiece Maxis drone that's what it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.139 
centerpiece Maxis drone that's what it
looks<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.609> was<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.120> like

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
looks like this was going to look like

looks like this was going to look like
sitting<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> table<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.760> agree

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
sitting on the table it's that agree

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
sitting on the table it's that agree
it's<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> jar<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> green<00:01:04.559> glow<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's like a jar with a green glow to it
and<00:01:05.489> inside<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.270> its<00:01:06.420> Max's<00:01:06.900> brain<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.380> that's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and inside of its Max's brain so that's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
and inside of its Max's brain so that's
piece<00:01:07.799> too<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:10.200> i'm<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> show<00:01:10.619> you

that<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.090> take<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.690> just<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.040> way

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
that I take is just this is the way

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.580 
that I take is just this is the way
towards<00:02:05.610> juggernaut<00:02:06.150> it's<00:02:06.810> probably<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
towards juggernaut it's probably not the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
towards juggernaut it's probably not the
fastest<00:02:08.190> way<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> like

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
fastest way but it's the way I like

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080 
fastest way but it's the way I like
taking<00:02:10.289> simply<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.490> run<00:02:11.700> by<00:02:11.850> here

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.819 
body part now the next part that you're
going<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.310> needing<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.930> guess

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
going to be needing is the I guess

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.000 
going to be needing is the I guess
updraft<00:03:53.370> wheels<00:03:53.670> or<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:55.019> i<00:03:55.079> call<00:03:55.859> it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
updraft wheels or I don't know i call it

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.470 
updraft wheels or I don't know i call it
like<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> steering<00:03:56.700> wheel<00:03:56.730> kind<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.299> but

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
like a steering wheel kind of but

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.690 
like a steering wheel kind of but
they're<00:03:57.630> actually<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> fan<00:03:58.230> motors<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.980> sit

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
they're actually the fan motors that sit

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.920 
they're actually the fan motors that sit
on<00:03:59.730> all<00:04:00.000> four<00:04:00.299> sides<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> drone

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
on all four sides of the drone

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.360 
on all four sides of the drone
and<00:04:02.049> you're<00:04:02.469> going<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.620> find<00:04:02.829> that<00:04:03.010> at<00:04:03.189> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
and you're going to find that at the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.300 
and you're going to find that at the
excavation<00:04:04.060> site<00:04:04.299> now<00:04:05.049> there<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:06.010> three

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
excavation site now there is three

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.220 
excavation site now there is three
different<00:04:06.640> locations<00:04:06.730> at<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.569> excavation

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
different locations at the excavation

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.209 
different locations at the excavation
site<00:04:08.439> that<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:08.890> actually<00:04:11.099> find<00:04:12.099> the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:12.219 
site that you can actually find the

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.920 
site that you can actually find the
piece<00:04:12.459> i'm<00:04:12.969> going<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.209> show<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.510> here

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
piece i'm going to show you that here

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.840 
piece i'm going to show you that here
just<00:04:14.379> a<00:04:14.469> minute<00:04:14.700> now<00:04:15.700> once<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.509> buy<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
just a minute now once you buy that the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.539 
just a minute now once you buy that the
gateway<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.750> excavation<00:04:20.440> site<00:04:20.680> if<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.370> go

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
gateway to the excavation site if you go

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.300 
gateway to the excavation site if you go
in<00:04:21.729> this<00:04:21.940> way<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:23.440> take<00:04:23.740> your<00:04:23.979> dart

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
in this way and you take your dart

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.159 
in this way and you take your dart
straight<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:27.280> left<00:04:27.870> usually<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.020> going

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
straight to the left usually it's going

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.409 
straight to the left usually it's going
to<00:04:29.229> be<00:04:29.380> in<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:29.620> corner<00:04:30.070> right<00:04:30.430> there<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:31.210> it

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
to be in that corner right there but it

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.240 
to be in that corner right there but it
could<00:04:31.690> spawn<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:32.320> any<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.650> these<00:04:32.770> corners

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
could spawn in any of these corners

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.089 
could spawn in any of these corners
sections<00:04:33.820> throughout<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:35.289> excavation<00:04:35.860> site

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
sections throughout the excavation site

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.070 
sections throughout the excavation site
if<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.940> not<00:04:37.120> up<00:04:37.300> there<00:04:37.360> then<00:04:37.900> you're<00:04:37.960> going

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
if it's not up there then you're going

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.650 
if it's not up there then you're going
to<00:04:38.139> want<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.410> go<00:04:38.440> down<00:04:38.830> now<00:04:39.190> there's<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.330> spawn

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
to want to go down now there's to spawn

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.390 
to want to go down now there's to spawn
spots<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.349> the<00:04:41.500> excavation<00:04:42.099> site<00:04:42.220> down

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
spots here in the excavation site down

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.870 
spots here in the excavation site down
below<00:04:42.759> okay<00:04:43.630> one<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.680> could<00:04:45.550> be<00:04:45.660> by<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.880> table

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
below okay one it could be by this table

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.520 
below okay one it could be by this table
or<00:04:49.090> speaker<00:04:49.690> system<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.139> guess<00:04:50.199> right<00:04:50.500> there

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
or speaker system I guess right there

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
on the floor it also could be over

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.749 
on the floor it also could be over
anywhere<00:04:57.849> along<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.599> box<00:04:59.410> or<00:04:59.740> before<00:05:00.550> you

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
anywhere along that box or before you

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.230 
anywhere along that box or before you
make<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.389> Gateway<00:05:01.900> down<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.400> floor<00:05:03.639> it

make the Gateway down to the floor it

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.550 
make the Gateway down to the floor it
could<00:05:04.449> actually<00:05:04.570> be<00:05:04.780> next<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.320> crate

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
could actually be next to the crate

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.770 
could actually be next to the crate
that's<00:05:05.770> sitting<00:05:06.010> there<00:05:06.220> if<00:05:06.610> it's<00:05:07.210> not<00:05:07.479> in

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
that's sitting there if it's not in

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.350 
that's sitting there if it's not in
those<00:05:08.560> three<00:05:08.919> spots<00:05:09.220> there's<00:05:09.550> one<00:05:09.789> more<00:05:10.000> spot

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
those three spots there's one more spot

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.210 
those three spots there's one more spot
that<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:10.659> could<00:05:10.810> possibly<00:05:10.960> be<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.680> it's

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
that it could possibly be and it's

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.830 
that it could possibly be and it's
further<00:05:12.460> down<00:05:12.789> here<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.330> it's<00:05:13.479> going<00:05:13.599> to<00:05:13.659> be

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
further down here and it's going to be

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.120 
further down here and it's going to be
on<00:05:14.220> one<00:05:15.220> of<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.849> bridge<00:05:16.449> walkways<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.349> you

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
on one of the bridge walkways and you

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.620 
on one of the bridge walkways and you
just<00:05:18.280> gotta<00:05:18.550> jump<00:05:18.610> your<00:05:19.000> way<00:05:19.030> down<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.599> the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
just gotta jump your way down to the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.920 
just gotta jump your way down to the
bridge<00:05:19.900> walkways<00:05:20.820> make<00:05:21.820> your<00:05:22.000> way<00:05:22.090> across<00:05:22.210> and

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
bridge walkways make your way across and

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.439 
bridge walkways make your way across and
then<00:05:23.760> i'm<00:05:24.760> going<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:25.000> show<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.150> here<00:05:25.360> in<00:05:25.419> just

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
then i'm going to show you here in just

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.810 
then i'm going to show you here in just
a<00:05:25.720> second<00:05:26.110> exactly<00:05:26.560> where<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.580> would<00:05:27.699> be

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
a second exactly where and it would be

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.320 
a second exactly where and it would be
right<00:05:28.060> there<00:05:28.090> on<00:05:28.680> top<00:05:29.680> of<00:05:29.949> that<00:05:30.070> box<00:05:30.400> so<00:05:31.150> that's

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
right there on top of that box so that's

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.050 
right there on top of that box so that's
where<00:05:31.659> all<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.900> spawn<00:05:32.349> spots<00:05:32.740> are<00:05:33.039> for<00:05:33.610> the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
where all the spawn spots are for the

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.020 
where all the spawn spots are for the
fan<00:05:34.300> blade<00:05:34.599> rotary<00:05:35.020> blades<00:05:35.320> that<00:05:35.979> you<00:05:36.820> have

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
fan blade rotary blades that you have

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.240 
fan blade rotary blades that you have
for<00:05:37.300> math<00:05:37.389> this<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.630> drone<00:05:38.080> now<00:05:38.800> once<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:39.099> got

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
for math this is drone now once you got

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.439 
for math this is drone now once you got
that<00:05:39.280> completed<00:05:39.880> you<00:05:39.970> can<00:05:40.000> go<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.330> any

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
that completed you can go to any

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.570 
that completed you can go to any
buildable<00:05:40.930> table<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.560> map<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:42.009> build<00:05:42.400> it

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
buildable table in the map and build it

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.779 
buildable table in the map and build it
and<00:05:42.750> fly<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.780> around<00:05:43.960> now<00:05:44.830> I<00:05:44.860> usually<00:05:45.250> last<00:05:45.460> for

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
and fly it around now I usually last for

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.450 
and fly it around now I usually last for
a<00:05:45.849> round<00:05:46.419> and<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.720> half<00:05:47.009> and<00:05:48.009> then<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.159> needs<00:05:48.280> to
