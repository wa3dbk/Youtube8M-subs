 aprons 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.650
 there are many more but we chose 3 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.880
 champion songs yes i'll find you 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.920
 were natural 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.369
 This is were you old PSV Also uhm 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.690
 is one 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.390
 I already have time to scream 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.699
 but yes that was lacking and 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.109
 championships could not do anything with it 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.039
 me but this also nice once 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:51.989

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.989
 Select direction Amsterdam 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.250

 from 1967 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.490
 why a champion left 20 under one 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.450
 championship must have taken so long 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.700
 to wait 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.540
 and now i 'm working out as a racial 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.440

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.200
