00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.820
 internet is a bit bigger and better than 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 From the ride then I'll have a little more 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.890
 time to post videos 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.899
 search for outbreaks however what 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.409
 complicates more there is the time for us 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.079
 We are recording grandchild is complicated at 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.899
 Sometimes we try to record but we do not 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.510
 I do not have time, I have not hit our 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.880
 goals 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.830
 have his appointments with the channel 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.090
 Hell, I have my commitments to 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 pib or extreme 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 so this video is more or less is it only 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.770
 to explain to you there what will be 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
 More Insect Life Videos Released 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.390
 as soon as possible is not an issue 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.820
 means that we would not like it I love 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.250
 record life of the insect falls series 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.430
 I like to do what I most 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.430
 I had fun laughing or insect life 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.980
 some people gave an idea of 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.900
 bring guests to the show I'm 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.100
 Thinking this, I 've talked to the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.440
 ride between to see 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.720
 I had an idea of ​​bringing a 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.210
 inscribed and stated that he could 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.430
 guest could be a giant in the case 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.040
 giant but normal size and we are 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.400
 insects then in case it would 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.410
 people or he would help but I do not think 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.230
 It would be fun for the guest because 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.330
 he was not going to enjoy the things he gives 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.890
 To make it little, then I 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.090
 I think the guests will also be 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.130
 insects 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.530
 I will still see this question of 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.140
 invited because I want to bookmark my 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.630
 we are not so popular we do not have so many 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.170
 friends , we have some friends there. 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.970
 youtube in a few more we have and I go 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.400
 talk to whoever you meet and see 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.019
 if they touch one is to make at least one 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.970
 episode a special participation 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.890
 beauty then the video is just not 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.980
 need to evaluate but if you want to 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.900
 You are a fan and you are one of those who read 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.900
 watch games if you want to evaluate the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 beauty is able to evaluate in relation to 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.810
 some people ask inside the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.880
 body flakes 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.000
 I have not done it yet I'm wanted 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.680
 to do but is a person who was 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.290
 working together with me na na na na 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.140
 creation between her ended up stopping 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.530
 what do you use to edit for me and do the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.590
 stop that I asked so she got 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.260
 break of the music inside we already have 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.550
 I've already got the whole idea in the head but 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.489
 I needed someone who was already 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.590
 Quite a lot of 4d cinema but it was already good 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.570
 so time could create some 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.250
 mass stops if you know someone 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.090
 want to divulge or if you know 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.590

 Paranauê spots you want to leave 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.370

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.220
 contact you for sure they will then 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.980
 This is what you have already planned. 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.990
 it has to be performed in relation to 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.360
 episodes as soon as possible we 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.070
