 now hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.490
 greet your friend vortex 666 sean 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.619
 all of you welcome to this new 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.450
 video and well this video is with 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.310
 motive of the new dlc that comes already 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.890
 announced for the month of June this month 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.630
 it follows that it's called 2 relics or 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.059
 Lost relics for world guides 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.670
 watch men and well then let's talk about 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.739
 this because the pack this DLC is going to include 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.300
 four new maps which three are 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.750
 to multiply and one for the mode 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.539
 overall a new so to speak mode 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.969
 game and by logic come new 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.609
 armor and new skins for weapons 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.789
 but well, the important thing about this is 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.769
 that returns to an old map that already 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.350
 Many know that it is checkout or 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.390
 purchases in gears of war 3 that was one of 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.909
 the preferred maps as this map goes to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.470
 come back a little re modified I do not know 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.440
 if they are going to open new lines or they are going to 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.870
 open new arrears of this new map 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.659
 Well many will remember girls no way 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.120
 I did not miss it good I miss it 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.340
 and the net I do not know what to do and not the 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.409
 lost 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.329
 well let's talk about the new 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.179
 game mode that comes the new mode of 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.569
 game is called break road that is to say is 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.450
 in English but so to speak in 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.869
 Spanish would be to break the gap 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.600
 Well, this game mode is like 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.299
 a run that reached you is a team 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.969
 that is going to bring a flag that is going to 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.520
 have a flag for goal so 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.069
 say it and well the joke of this 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.049
 is to run to grab the flag and so 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.709
 say it survive with girls longer 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.149
 that you have the flag or that is how you 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.130
 I say is a run that reached you venues 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.259
 grab the flag and be with a 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.159
 I'm holding the flag until I get you 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.780
 kill 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.579
 already when they are going to kill you you must arrive 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.649
 you flag one of your plans you 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.830
 they made one of your classmates so that 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.470
 this one I'm also running escorts 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 this does not have much mind any of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 attack so to speak has nothing of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.030
 strategy more to protect so 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.520
 say it and well then this is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.920
 protect your flag get it the greatest 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.260
 number of points I do not know or time is going to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.850
 load and it's going to fill up well this 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920
 game is more than anything something defensive is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.140
 as if to say it as guards but 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.370
 with a flag or you have to take care 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.650
 your galway that brings the flag 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.659
 this game mode is a bit good 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.500
 he saw it in some games out there 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.540
 before it's nothing new it's something I do not know 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 something weird something good for me 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 good good is something new to guide your 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.349
 guard che and well as you already 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.930
 had mentioned the new skins of 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.420
 weapons and armor we still do not have 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.299
 so say it images of what has come 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.890
 that penn is fine but but well 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.769
 of the new maps well the map that is 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.360
 the city calls for the lost city 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.990
 this new map is somewhat long is 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.270
 similar to so to say as to you 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.010
 well I do not have a clear idea but 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.500
 it has a tower- like shape what is 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.320
 say there's a lot of up and in the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.230
 center there is a I am a sand for 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.600
 to say it as a bridge as good comes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.760
 another map that is museum a map 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.040
 extremely a bit big is with a 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.460
 little hole seems if it's too big 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.930
 really and well it comes on a map that 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.760
 it's called word 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.909
 well this map this only 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.129
 for the veron mode that is to say they are 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.959
 only those who are going to be able to play it 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.810
 that way but it's not for multiplayer 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.049
 this is precisely censored for that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.859
 and well, since we 're seeing this 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.069
 still do not have information 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.469
 detailed then it says that it also comes 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.019
 good since it comes to correct in a 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.660
 week because it's almost over may we're going to 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.910
 a little more than half 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.000
 Well, it says that they will come different 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.250
 different game mode for a re 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.250
 modification for what it is 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.209
 in the youtube software and a re 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.799
 amendment for changes armand 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.250
 for execution that were already how much 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.590

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.450
 and well now this is we do not have 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.930
