I guess this is the pink rather than the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.370

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
all um but I think it would transfer

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.330 
all um but I think it would transfer
some<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.150> color<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.600> lips<00:04:04.840> um<00:04:05.340> that
