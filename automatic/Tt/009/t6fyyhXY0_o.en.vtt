00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.799
 I saw the aliens 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:26.140
 now I'll explain or edit the videos I don't have 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.470
 found in a video file of my own 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.280
 resumed from the plane while you're type at 12 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 thousand feet high no feet shoes with 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.179
 in short, for you the size of the feet 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:46.780
 latitude which are 8 thousand feet that 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:49.089
 number and foot 43 44 38 if it is not that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.859
 nothing works successfully 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.489
 we see this scene here that is I will 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.589
 I sign the hero who goes quiet is certain 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.280
 point while I exposed the camera 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.100
 from the wing to the inside of the plane 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.950
 we see a codec darting so over 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.570
 sorry but at 12,000 meters altitude 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 a choir passes over the plane but 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 close black that is evening a plane was 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 white mecenero and I thought then there is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 aliens exist in the sense that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.130
 crazy does it when it was what they say 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 never risked anyone badly 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.289
 30 centimeters 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.810
 I don't know to understand what how much is a 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.749
 ie foot is said to be 8 thousand feet of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.659
 grandfather height of 18 thousand feet of 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:02:00.100
 height 8 thousand feet that no to 8 thousand 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.229
 feet say sorry less heaven than that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.999
 we are the feet no because the planes 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.880
 and invented foot locker 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:10.330
 no sir located because the english 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.670
 measure another thumb with your feet 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.510
 life of measuring my eyes I will refuse 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.200
 of idiots in 2014 of globalization 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.420
 they are the only suckers they drive to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.510
 right and there is a new measure 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 different and therefore of pound what is pound 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.660
 so i'm another type eight feet you 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.250
 I reach in a no no we are the no 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.500
 because just explaining that having seen this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 alien there is this is not foreign but 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.550
 it is known if an alien tries Saturday at 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.250
 risk on the plane while I was coming back 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.630
 from miami there was I put the room outside 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.310
 and a bunk bedroom a cane c 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.090
 shot of who kills me but who 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.520
 fuck you happy you see it on is 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.940
 arrived on the alitalia flight the camera 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.850
 on the cart the film as reds no 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.970
 the digital camera this out does not 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.070
 it's because I can't take it out like this 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.660
 no this maybe one day can serve 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:17.500
 but in fact now it is a good idea if you need some 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 clouds you love wenders you won't have everything 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.800
 point 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.750
 we see that I am going to put back with 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.350
 this digital camera reduces you 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.550
 still a few years we talk about issuing a ride 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.920
 towards the inside of the plane you can see 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.330
 whizzing a fine black stuff I thought 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.490
 on two things the first is superman is 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.710
 improbable that that is starting from the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.010
 America has yes, because you adapt it 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.650
 camera is not said by now vicenza bra ma 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.620
 are the students made head stuff yes 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.330
 his film is not here I know it exists 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.630
 it sublimates me and I show it 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.630
 here 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.610
 you saw it's not a mom and the car 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.190
 on the objective of no because it hurtles 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:10.569
 so if you can of waste plan 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:12.550
 let's watch it slowly you saw dot 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.340
 of the one understands is a great alien 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.900
 how do you enlarge it do the photo is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.210
 that of trying the things to do will be 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.060
 the huge computer to watch from 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.620
 Marshal sees blood type 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.470
 there are no such programs are films 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.140
 Downloaded there won't be so much bullshit 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.490
 I think maybe the students are 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.880
 it was one upstairs who threw the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.880
 trash 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.750
 she is not a median 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.120
 there is a stain on the lens of the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
 camera but not one 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.280
 maybe director and paolo for example says 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.580
 that every night without the aliens over the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.730
 home will this wife rome paolo yes you are 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.410

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.690
 There was a jump at Paul's home 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.669
 that same evening the earthquake 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.830
 the aliens is not so life 2,000 two thousand 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.460
 so that when they landed they took off from 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.830
 animate where he does from paolo a 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.940
 see linate from his home that has 46 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.040
 kilometers has a chapter put the b 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.020
 later I will do it with the coin was 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.270
 totally dark so if you see a euro 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.340
 take off where he thinks of thirty yes 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.840
 things will take off part 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.030
 he asked dripping like that and him 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.860
 looked up straight not mauro go to 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.460
 but they end up its terrace that is 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.500
 crooked then one took fire 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.229

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.720

 savona polisher I this that 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.030
 aliens there are enneses in my opinion 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.669

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.400
 alien 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.400

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.270

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.460
