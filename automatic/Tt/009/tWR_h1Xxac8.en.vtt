00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
actually just because it's kind of

I've unlocked this notes function which

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
I've unlocked this notes function which
is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.509> pad<00:01:33.780> part<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.320> calc<00:01:34.590> pad<00:01:34.920> and

essentially this is kind of a dummy
security<00:01:37.680> device<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> sense<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> if

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
security device in the sense of if

security device in the sense of if
anyone<00:01:39.240> opens<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.500> looks<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
anyone opens it up this looks like a

anyone opens it up this looks like a
calculator<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:41.790> obviously<00:01:41.939> no

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
calculator and there's obviously no

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
calculator and there's obviously no
indication<00:01:42.750> saying<00:01:43.049> hey<00:01:43.259> two<00:01:43.590> fingers<00:01:43.890> slide

to get to the notes so it's a security
thing<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> false

you<00:03:14.080> know<00:03:14.170> standard<00:03:14.530> iOS<00:03:14.950> kind<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.400> looking

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
you know standard iOS kind of looking

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.370 
you know standard iOS kind of looking
things<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.210> looks<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.510> lot<00:03:16.660> like<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.960> notepad

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
things this looks a lot like the notepad

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.620 
things this looks a lot like the notepad
app<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.920> enough<00:03:18.640> that's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.000> good<00:03:19.240> thing<00:03:19.480> I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
app and enough that's a good thing I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.780 
app and enough that's a good thing I
feel<00:03:19.840> right<00:03:20.050> at<00:03:20.110> home<00:03:20.230> in<00:03:20.410> this<00:03:20.560> app<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:21.220> think

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
feel right at home in this app I think

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.190 
feel right at home in this app I think
they've<00:03:21.880> done<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.060> fantastic<00:03:22.330> job<00:03:22.720> during<00:03:23.020> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
they've done a fantastic job during the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960 
they've done a fantastic job during the
design<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.770> obviously<00:03:24.310> going<00:03:24.520> back<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.880> the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
design and obviously going back to the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.550 
design and obviously going back to the
calculator<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.540> as<00:03:25.720> easy<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:26.110> hitting<00:03:26.290> open

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
calculator is as easy as hitting open

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.070 
calculator is as easy as hitting open
calculator<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.490> then<00:03:28.210> getting<00:03:28.510> back<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
calculator and then getting back to the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.660 
calculator and then getting back to the
notes<00:03:29.290> obviously<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.070> two<00:03:30.190> fingers<00:03:30.490> slide

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
notes obviously the two fingers slide

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.030 
notes obviously the two fingers slide
mechanic<00:03:31.120> which<00:03:31.270> is<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> nice<00:03:31.570> idea<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.260> it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
mechanic which is a nice idea and it

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.220 
mechanic which is a nice idea and it
works<00:03:33.220> very<00:03:33.310> well<00:03:33.520> on<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.780> really<00:03:35.020> quickly

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
works very well on just really quickly

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.900 
works very well on just really quickly
deleting<00:03:35.740> notes<00:03:35.920> as<00:03:36.100> as<00:03:36.250> easy<00:03:36.430> as<00:03:36.610> you'd<00:03:36.760> hope

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
deleting notes as as easy as you'd hope

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
deleting notes as as easy as you'd hope
it<00:03:37.030> would<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.270> an<00:03:37.390> iOS<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:38.170> slide<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.920> then

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it would be an iOS just slide and then

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.570 
it would be an iOS just slide and then
delete<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.780> that's<00:03:41.770> essentially<00:03:42.280> what<00:03:42.490> this

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
delete so that's essentially what this

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.490 
delete so that's essentially what this
app<00:03:42.790> has<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.240> offer<00:03:43.450> let<00:03:44.050> me<00:03:44.140> be<00:03:44.290> sure<00:03:44.470> I

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
app has to offer let me be sure I

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.000 
app has to offer let me be sure I
haven't<00:03:44.740> missed<00:03:44.860> anything<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.580> quick

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
haven't missed anything really quick

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.980 
haven't missed anything really quick
note<00:03:48.150> obviously<00:03:49.150> going<00:03:49.330> back<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.720> your<00:03:49.810> Notes

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990

is<00:03:50.170> as<00:03:50.350> easy<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.860> hitting<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.610> little<00:03:51.850> list

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
is as easy as hitting the little list

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.500 
is as easy as hitting the little list
icon<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.060> essentially<00:03:55.420> what

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
icon there but this is essentially what

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.810 
icon there but this is essentially what
calc<00:03:56.110> pad<00:03:56.380> has<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.830> offer<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.640> real

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
calc pad has to offer so the real

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.270 
calc pad has to offer so the real
question<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.390> have<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.590> worth<00:03:59.620> a<00:04:00.070> dollar

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
question I have is is it worth a dollar

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.670 
question I have is is it worth a dollar
ninety-nine<00:04:00.880> price<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> end<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
ninety-nine price and at the end of the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.730 
ninety-nine price and at the end of the
day<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:02.830> think<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.520> is<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.870> say<00:04:05.350> that<00:04:05.560> because

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
day I think it is I say that because

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.800 
day I think it is I say that because
obviously<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.820> isn't<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.210> most<00:04:07.360> secure

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
obviously this isn't the most secure

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.620 
obviously this isn't the most secure
method<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:09.190> know<00:04:09.340> saving<00:04:09.790> notes<00:04:10.300> if<00:04:10.510> you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
method of you know saving notes if you

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.200 
method of you know saving notes if you
have<00:04:10.780> a<00:04:10.810> real<00:04:11.170> need<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.530> encrypt<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.160> save<00:04:12.430> you

have a real need to encrypt and save you

have a real need to encrypt and save you
know<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:13.840> probably<00:04:14.200> isn't<00:04:14.590> your<00:04:14.830> best<00:04:15.010> bet

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
know this probably isn't your best bet

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.039 
know this probably isn't your best bet
but<00:04:15.880> at<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> same<00:04:16.270> time<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.810> just<00:04:16.989> general

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
awesome and it's a nice mechanic like I

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.610 
awesome and it's a nice mechanic like I

them in and do that which is nice I

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.029 
them in and do that which is nice I
think<00:05:10.270> it's<00:05:10.360> well<00:05:10.510> integrated<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.530> I'm<00:05:11.949> going

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
think it's well integrated so I'm going

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.170 
think it's well integrated so I'm going
to<00:05:12.190> give<00:05:12.370> this<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:13.199> 4<00:05:14.199> out<00:05:14.380> of<00:05:14.440> 5<00:05:14.740> stars<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.699> the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
to give this a 4 out of 5 stars and the

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.480 
to give this a 4 out of 5 stars and the
reason<00:05:16.389> being<00:05:16.780> mostly<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.740> price<00:05:18.190> I

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
reason being mostly just the price I

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.850 
reason being mostly just the price I
feel<00:05:18.729> like<00:05:18.820> if<00:05:18.970> this<00:05:19.120> were<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.360> dollar<00:05:19.860> that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
feel like if this were a dollar that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.070 
feel like if this were a dollar that
would<00:05:20.979> be<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:21.340> sweet<00:05:21.820> spot<00:05:22.120> for<00:05:22.389> this<00:05:22.570> app<00:05:22.780> but

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
would be the sweet spot for this app but

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.510 
would be the sweet spot for this app but
at<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.199> same<00:05:23.380> time<00:05:23.590> it's<00:05:23.889> fully<00:05:24.190> functional
