00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you're not going to be able to use it in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
you're not going to be able to use it in
your<00:00:27.750> machine<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.650> basically<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.310> goes

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
your machine and basically that goes

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.130 
your machine and basically that goes
into<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.529> bobbin<00:00:31.529> chamber<00:00:32.540> now<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
into the bobbin chamber now this is a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.600 
into the bobbin chamber now this is a
thimble<00:00:35.120> which<00:00:36.120> pretty<00:00:36.390> much<00:00:36.480> any<00:00:36.780> any

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
thimble which pretty much any any

thimble which pretty much any any
seamstress<00:00:38.610> should<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.180> handy<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
seamstress should have handy and this is

seamstress should have handy and this is
a<00:00:41.489> seam<00:00:41.879> ripper<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.500> make<00:00:44.129> mistake

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and so something that you didn't mean to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.880 
and so something that you didn't mean to
so<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.920> will<00:00:47.370> happen<00:00:47.550> many<00:00:47.850> times<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.420> sure

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
so which will happen many times I'm sure

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.779 
so which will happen many times I'm sure
you're<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> you're<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> want

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you're going to you're not going to want

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.299 
you're going to you're not going to want
to<00:00:50.879> rip<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.570> use<00:00:52.050> scissors<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> cut<00:00:53.039> your

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to rip or use scissors to cut your

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
to rip or use scissors to cut your
stitches<00:00:53.969> apart<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> will<00:00:54.750> wreck

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
stitches apart because that will wreck

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
stitches apart because that will wreck
your<00:00:55.079> fabric<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:56.670> sharp<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
your fabric so this is very sharp so you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
your fabric so this is very sharp so you
want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.780> always<00:00:57.899> keep<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> covered<00:00:58.410> when

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
want to always keep it covered when

want to always keep it covered when
you're<00:00:58.770> not<00:00:58.859> using<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.399> keep<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.609> away

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you're not using it and keep it away

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
you're not using it and keep it away
from<00:00:59.820> small<00:01:00.210> children<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.170> basically<00:01:01.620> what

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
from small children but basically what

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
from small children but basically what
it<00:01:02.489> does<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.059> rips<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> seams<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.110> such<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it does is it rips the seams in such a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
it does is it rips the seams in such a
way<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> ruin<00:01:05.580> your

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
way that you're not going to ruin your

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
way that you're not going to ruin your
fabric<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.869> i'll<00:01:07.200> show<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> how<00:01:10.159> i'm<00:01:11.159> going

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
fabric and i'll show you how i'm going

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.899 
fabric and i'll show you how i'm going
to<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.460> ahead<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.549> tiny

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to go ahead and so just this little tiny

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
to go ahead and so just this little tiny
piece<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> regular<00:01:16.020> straight

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
piece it's just a regular straight

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:26.620 
piece it's just a regular straight
stitch<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.570> proper<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
stitch so the proper way to use this is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
stitch so the proper way to use this is
by<00:01:27.630> gently<00:01:29.720> inserting<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> edge<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.090> pulling

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
by gently inserting the edge and pulling

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.460 
by gently inserting the edge and pulling
on<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> breaks<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.049> thread<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
on it so that it breaks the thread and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.710 
on it so that it breaks the thread and
moving<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> next<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.450> don't<00:01:39.450> open

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
moving on to the next one don't open

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480 
moving on to the next one don't open
you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> tempted<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> open<00:01:41.220> your

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're going to be tempted to open your

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.999 
you're going to be tempted to open your
your<00:01:42.299> fabric<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.560> seem<00:01:43.770> like

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this and try to rip through it that way

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.450 
this and try to rip through it that way
and<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> ruin<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:46.979> fabric<00:01:47.340> so
