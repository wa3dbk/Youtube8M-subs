bit<00:01:40.409> different<00:01:40.799> story<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> love<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
bit different story what I love is the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
bit different story what I love is the
size<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.750> very<00:01:43.020> compact<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.430> feel

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
size it's very compact you don't feel

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.510 
size it's very compact you don't feel
like<00:01:44.939> you're<00:01:45.360> getting<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.770> sloppy<00:01:47.159> with

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
like you're getting really sloppy with

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.160 
like you're getting really sloppy with
your<00:01:47.670> application<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.930> got

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
your application you know it's got

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
your application you know it's got
little<00:01:49.470> tiny<00:01:49.710> rubber<00:01:50.399> bristles<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.390> they're

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little tiny rubber bristles and they're

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.800 
little tiny rubber bristles and they're
kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.770> clusters<00:01:53.390> see<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.600> like

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
kind of in little clusters see that like

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
kind of in little clusters see that like
you've<00:01:54.960> got<00:01:55.170> varying<00:01:55.680> rows<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you've got varying rows you can see the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.149 
you've got varying rows you can see the
rows<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.450> twist<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.770> they're<00:01:58.950> also

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
rows as I twist it here but they're also

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030 
rows as I twist it here but they're also
in<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.570> clumps<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.680> think

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
in little kind of clumps and I think

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.850 
in little kind of clumps and I think
that<00:02:02.579> paired<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> formula<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that paired with the kind of formula of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.580 
that paired with the kind of formula of
this<00:02:05.130> mascara<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:06.420> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.930> causes<00:02:07.409> my

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this mascara is what kind of causes my

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.839 
this mascara is what kind of causes my
lashes<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.250> stick<00:02:08.729> together<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.270> little

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
lashes to stick together a little

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.610 
lashes to stick together a little
when<00:02:10.030> I'm<00:02:10.119> applying<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.109> formula<00:02:11.560> is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
when I'm applying this the formula is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.380 
when I'm applying this the formula is
something<00:02:11.799> that<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.310> normally<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:13.030> enjoy

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
something that I normally really enjoy

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.929 
something that I normally really enjoy
it's<00:02:13.569> not<00:02:13.749> too<00:02:14.019> wet<00:02:14.290> not<00:02:14.620> too<00:02:14.829> dry<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.790> would

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
it's not too wet not too dry I would

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.759 
it's not too wet not too dry I would
describe<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.389> as<00:02:16.480> kind<00:02:16.689> of<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.900> thick<00:02:17.230> creamy

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
describe it as kind of a thick creamy

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.099 
describe it as kind of a thick creamy
formula<00:02:18.430> for<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> mascara<00:02:19.269> it's<00:02:19.450> very<00:02:19.749> bland

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
formula for a mascara it's very bland

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.910 
formula for a mascara it's very bland
but<00:02:20.409> if<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.709> have<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> wand<00:02:21.430> that's<00:02:22.060> maybe<00:02:22.420> not

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
but if I have a wand that's maybe not

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.319 
but if I have a wand that's maybe not
separating<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.099> lashes<00:02:24.400> out<00:02:24.790> quite<00:02:25.299> well

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
separating my lashes out quite well

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.959 
separating my lashes out quite well
enough<00:02:26.139> that<00:02:26.709> kind<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.189> formula<00:02:27.579> can

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
enough that kind of a formula can

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:30.959 
enough that kind of a formula can
translate<00:02:28.659> to<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.129> overloading<00:02:30.849> the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
translate to kind of overloading the

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.149 
translate to kind of overloading the
lashes<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.719> making<00:02:32.290> them<00:02:32.439> stick<00:02:32.739> together<00:02:32.889> a

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
lashes and making them stick together a

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.129 
lashes and making them stick together a
bit<00:02:33.430> more<00:02:33.459> thinking<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.389> brush<00:02:34.659> on<00:02:34.900> this

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
bit more thinking if the brush on this

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.229 
bit more thinking if the brush on this
had<00:02:35.469> like<00:02:35.739> traditional<00:02:36.310> bristles<00:02:36.849> and<00:02:37.120> just

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
had like traditional bristles and just

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.509 
had like traditional bristles and just
lots<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.810> them<00:02:38.109> that's<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.769> kind<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.159> brush

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
lots of them that's the kind of brush

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.489 
lots of them that's the kind of brush
that<00:02:39.819> normally<00:02:40.329> does<00:02:40.599> really<00:02:40.870> well<00:02:41.109> on<00:02:41.319> my

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:41.499 
that normally does really well on my

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.110 
that normally does really well on my
lashes<00:02:41.769> because<00:02:42.159> I<00:02:42.219> don't<00:02:42.430> feel<00:02:42.669> like<00:02:42.879> I<00:02:43.000> have

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
lashes because I don't feel like I have

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.909 
lashes because I don't feel like I have
the<00:02:43.239> thickest<00:02:43.629> lashes<00:02:44.079> ever<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.590> they're

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
the thickest lashes ever and they're

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.140 
the thickest lashes ever and they're
kind<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.189> straight<00:02:45.459> they<00:02:45.639> kind<00:02:45.819> of<00:02:45.849> like<00:02:46.000> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
kind of straight they kind of like to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.300 
kind of straight they kind of like to
point<00:02:46.359> downward<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.139> I<00:02:47.169> tend<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:47.739> brushes

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
point downward so I tend to like brushes

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.459 
point downward so I tend to like brushes
that<00:02:48.459> appear<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.939> be<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.540> loaded<00:02:50.439> with

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:50.469 
that appear to be just loaded with

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.740 
that appear to be just loaded with
bristles<00:02:51.159> because<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.699> think<00:02:51.879> that's<00:02:52.180> my<00:02:52.419> best

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
bristles because I think that's my best

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.809 
bristles because I think that's my best
chance<00:02:53.079> at<00:02:53.379> getting<00:02:53.439> real<00:02:53.859> separation<00:02:54.159> and

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
chance at getting real separation and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.449 
chance at getting real separation and
looking<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.659> I<00:02:55.689> have<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.109> lot<00:02:56.439> of<00:02:56.469> lashes<00:02:57.010> when

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
looking like I have a lot of lashes when

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.789 
looking like I have a lot of lashes when
I<00:02:57.489> apply<00:02:57.939> this<00:02:58.000> what<00:02:58.659> it<00:02:58.780> does<00:02:58.989> do<00:02:59.260> well<00:02:59.500> I

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
I apply this what it does do well I

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.699 
I apply this what it does do well I
think<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.189> length<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:01.569> does<00:03:01.629> add<00:03:02.139> thickness

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
think is length it does add thickness

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.220 
think is length it does add thickness
but<00:03:03.189> again<00:03:03.519> what's<00:03:03.879> added<00:03:04.299> thickness<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:05.049> it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
but again what's added thickness if it's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.809 
but again what's added thickness if it's
just<00:03:05.469> kind<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.680> making<00:03:05.919> lashes<00:03:06.519> stick

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
just kind of making lashes stick

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.689 
just kind of making lashes stick
together<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.540> looking<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.799> individual

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
together and not looking like individual

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.300 
together and not looking like individual
thick<00:03:10.030> lashes<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.199> absolutely<00:03:12.129> -

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
thick lashes you know so absolutely -

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.399 
thick lashes you know so absolutely -
thumbs<00:03:12.609> up<00:03:12.819> if<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.239> had<00:03:13.449> a<00:03:13.480> third<00:03:13.780> thumb<00:03:14.139> it

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
thumbs up if I had a third thumb it

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.770 
thumbs up if I had a third thumb it
would<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.650> three<00:03:14.949> thumbs<00:03:15.189> up<00:03:15.549> for<00:03:15.909> that<00:03:15.970> wand

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
would get three thumbs up for that wand

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.499 
would get three thumbs up for that wand
I<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.290> love<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.739> bend<00:03:17.979> in<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.819> brush<00:03:19.150> is

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
I just love the bend in it the brush is

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.649 
I just love the bend in it the brush is
pretty<00:03:20.169> good<00:03:20.379> but<00:03:21.189> not<00:03:21.370> great<00:03:21.790> again<00:03:22.449> I<00:03:22.479> think

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
pretty good but not great again I think

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.990 
pretty good but not great again I think
it<00:03:22.900> could<00:03:23.109> use<00:03:23.349> even<00:03:23.680> more<00:03:23.859> bristles<00:03:24.639> maybe<00:03:24.939> a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it could use even more bristles maybe a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.759 
it could use even more bristles maybe a
little<00:03:25.269> bit<00:03:25.359> longer<00:03:25.659> bristles<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.470> maybe<00:03:26.650> I

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
little bit longer bristles and maybe I

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.679 
little bit longer bristles and maybe I
would<00:03:26.949> get<00:03:27.129> more<00:03:27.250> separation<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.269> am<00:03:28.509> gonna

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:28.689 
would get more separation I am gonna

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.089 
would get more separation I am gonna
keep<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.139> though<00:03:29.319> when<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> run<00:03:29.709> out<00:03:29.859> of<00:03:29.889> this

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
keep that though when I run out of this

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.770 
keep that though when I run out of this
I'm<00:03:30.250> keeping<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.790> wand<00:03:31.000> around<00:03:31.209> because

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
I'm keeping the wand around because

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.050 
I'm keeping the wand around because
maybe<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:32.739> used<00:03:33.069> bear<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.669> might<00:03:33.849> be

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
maybe you just used bear it might be

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.999 
maybe you just used bear it might be
nice<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.329> brush<00:03:35.019> through<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.379> now<00:03:35.620> talking

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
nice to brush through it now talking

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.069 
nice to brush through it now talking
about<00:03:36.159> how<00:03:36.370> well<00:03:36.639> it<00:03:36.790> wears<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.449> don't<00:03:37.689> think<00:03:37.959> it

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
about how well it wears I don't think it

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.780 
about how well it wears I don't think it
does<00:03:38.229> a<00:03:38.259> great<00:03:38.500> job<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:39.069> holding<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.549> curl

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
does a great job of holding the curl

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.229 
does a great job of holding the curl
it's<00:03:40.120> not<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.599> they<00:03:40.900> immediately<00:03:41.799> fall

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
it's not like they immediately fall

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.219 
it's not like they immediately fall
L'Oreal<00:03:43.239> voluminous<00:03:43.419> is<00:03:43.930> one<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.169> those

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
L'Oreal voluminous is one of those

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.469 
L'Oreal voluminous is one of those
mascaras<00:03:44.889> that<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.099> love<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.609> wand<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.150> kind<00:03:46.449> of

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
mascaras that I love the wand I kind of

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.469 
mascaras that I love the wand I kind of
like<00:03:46.659> that<00:03:46.900> formula<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:48.159> it<00:03:48.430> really<00:03:48.939> causes

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
like that formula but it really causes

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.629 
like that formula but it really causes
my<00:03:49.629> lashes<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.229> fall<00:03:50.409> immediately<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:51.459> not

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
my lashes to fall immediately it's not

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.550 
my lashes to fall immediately it's not
that<00:03:51.909> quick<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.419> thing<00:03:52.629> with<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:52.959> mascara

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that quick of a thing with this mascara

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.499 
that quick of a thing with this mascara
but<00:03:54.129> I<00:03:54.189> think<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.699> a<00:03:54.729> little<00:03:55.060> heavy<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.389> the

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:55.509 
but I think it is a little heavy on the

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:59.069 
but I think it is a little heavy on the
lashes<00:03:55.870> also<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> lashes<00:03:57.280> feel<00:03:57.639> pretty<00:03:58.509> hard

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
lashes also the lashes feel pretty hard

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.080 
lashes also the lashes feel pretty hard

if you've tried Mally's volumizing

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.999 
if you've tried Mally's volumizing
mascara<00:04:01.629> that's<00:04:01.900> one<00:04:02.169> that<00:04:02.319> doesn't<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:02.859> that

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
mascara that's one that doesn't do that

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.499 
mascara that's one that doesn't do that
at<00:04:03.159> all<00:04:03.310> if<00:04:03.459> you've<00:04:03.669> used<00:04:03.699> that<00:04:04.060> one<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.479> know

eye<00:04:16.509> and<00:04:16.989> that's<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.259> problem<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.799> have<00:04:18.039> with<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
eye and that's a problem I have with a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.370 
eye and that's a problem I have with a
lot<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.669> mascaras<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:19.630> that's<00:04:19.840> why<00:04:20.019> I'm<00:04:20.139> always

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
lot of mascaras so that's why I'm always

they're<00:04:23.349> on<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.710> lower<00:04:23.889> lashes<00:04:24.159> because<00:04:24.490> I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
they're on the lower lashes because I

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.520 
they're on the lower lashes because I
can<00:04:24.729> trust<00:04:24.939> that<00:04:25.210> one<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:25.689> bottom<00:04:25.900> line<00:04:26.050> this

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
can trust that one so bottom line this

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.559 
can trust that one so bottom line this
is<00:04:26.710> not<00:04:26.889> a<00:04:26.919> cheap<00:04:27.280> mascara<00:04:27.909> this<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.539> a

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.350 
is not a cheap mascara this is like a
$32<00:04:29.409> product<00:04:30.069> and<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.370> think<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.879> wand<00:04:31.150> is

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
$32 product and I think the wand is

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.209 
$32 product and I think the wand is
incredibly<00:04:31.900> innovative<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.620> love<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.099> I

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:33.219 
incredibly innovative and I love it I

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.679 
incredibly innovative and I love it I
mean<00:04:33.370> how<00:04:33.490> many<00:04:33.550> times<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.150> said<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.449> in

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
mean how many times have I said that in

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.839 
mean how many times have I said that in
this<00:04:34.810> short<00:04:35.319> video<00:04:35.560> already<00:04:36.219> but<00:04:36.669> when<00:04:36.819> I

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
this short video already but when I

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.119 
this short video already but when I
really<00:04:37.180> get<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.449> looking<00:04:37.719> at<00:04:37.900> them<00:04:38.050> up<00:04:38.259> close<00:04:38.289> I

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
really get to looking at them up close I

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.709 
really get to looking at them up close I
don't<00:04:39.460> feel<00:04:39.729> like<00:04:39.879> I'm<00:04:40.029> seeing<00:04:40.240> as<00:04:40.479> many

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
don't feel like I'm seeing as many

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.469 
don't feel like I'm seeing as many
lashes<00:04:41.409> as<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.830> could<00:04:42.219> be<00:04:42.490> seeing<00:04:42.939> I<00:04:43.120> think<00:04:43.360> it's

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
lashes as I could be seeing I think it's

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.659 
lashes as I could be seeing I think it's
a<00:04:43.569> great<00:04:43.870> concept<00:04:44.229> but<00:04:44.740> for<00:04:45.129> the<00:04:45.249> few<00:04:45.460> things

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
a great concept but for the few things

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.850 
a great concept but for the few things
that<00:04:45.819> don't<00:04:45.999> really<00:04:46.509> agree<00:04:47.139> with<00:04:47.169> my<00:04:47.529> lashes

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
that don't really agree with my lashes

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.589 
that don't really agree with my lashes
in<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.490> product<00:04:48.999> I<00:04:49.120> don't<00:04:49.300> think<00:04:49.479> it's

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
in this product I don't think it's

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.420 
in this product I don't think it's
something<00:04:49.749> I'm<00:04:50.020> gonna<00:04:50.139> be<00:04:50.319> repurchasing<00:04:51.129> so
