alright in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.940 
alright in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.840> some<00:00:04.110> simple<00:00:05.000> lighting<00:00:06.080> and<00:00:07.080> what

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
show you some simple lighting and what

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.020 
show you some simple lighting and what
I'm<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.940> ahead<00:00:09.059> as<00:00:09.450> designed<00:00:11.030> simple

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I'm going ahead as designed simple

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.499 
I'm going ahead as designed simple
little<00:00:12.679> set<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> library<00:00:14.549> set<00:00:14.849> we've<00:00:15.299> got

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
little set here a library set we've got

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.510 
little set here a library set we've got
two<00:00:15.780> different<00:00:15.900> styles<00:00:16.289> I'm<00:00:16.710> chair<00:00:17.070> we've<00:00:17.369> got

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
two different styles I'm chair we've got

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.550 
two different styles I'm chair we've got
an<00:00:17.640> Eames<00:00:17.850> chair<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.720> also<00:00:19.140> we've<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
an Eames chair and also we've got a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.009 
an Eames chair and also we've got a
chair<00:00:20.550> from<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> Library<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.769> Alexandria<00:00:24.019> got

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
chair from the Library of Alexandria got

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.939 
chair from the Library of Alexandria got
a<00:00:25.050> student<00:00:25.640> bottled<00:00:26.689> really<00:00:27.689> quickly<00:00:28.170> some

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
a student bottled really quickly some

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.560 
a student bottled really quickly some
library<00:00:29.400> books<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:30.060> took<00:00:30.359> some

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
library books actually took some

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.160 
library books actually took some
pictures<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.170> library<00:00:31.679> some<00:00:32.489> books<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
pictures of the library some books and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
pictures of the library some books and
see<00:00:34.170> they're<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.829> quickly<00:00:35.190> modeled

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
see they're very very quickly modeled

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.250 
see they're very very quickly modeled
with<00:00:36.770> polygons<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> do

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
with polygons so what we're going to do

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
with polygons so what we're going to do
we've<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.920> simple<00:00:41.280> X<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> just

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we've got some simple X here and just

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
we've got some simple X here and just
want<00:00:42.239> some<00:00:42.390> track<00:00:42.660> lighting<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.410> also<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> can

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
want some track lighting and also to can

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.360 
want some track lighting and also to can
lights<00:00:44.520> trying<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> Center<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.010> light<00:00:47.010> over

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
lights trying to Center this light over

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.090 
lights trying to Center this light over
the<00:00:47.520> table<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.530> constantly<00:00:49.530> unique

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the table so it constantly unique

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
the table so it constantly unique
lighting<00:00:50.399> qualities<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
lighting qualities what we're going to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
lighting qualities what we're going to
be<00:00:52.289> using<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:53.129> IES<00:00:53.699> Lighting's<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
be using some IES Lighting's so the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.240 
be using some IES Lighting's so the
first<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> need<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.100> ahead

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
first thing we need to do is go ahead

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.170 
first thing we need to do is go ahead
and<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.750> room<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.489> proportion

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and get this room and a right proportion

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
and get this room and a right proportion
so<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.500> already<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.399> some

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
so you see here already got some

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
so you see here already got some
measuring<00:01:03.600> devices<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.500> need<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
measuring devices here we need to go

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
measuring devices here we need to go
ahead<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.570> measure<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
ahead and show you how to measure this

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.010 
ahead and show you how to measure this
room<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.760> lights<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.240> IES<00:01:09.720> lights

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
room up so the lights the IES lights

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
room up so the lights the IES lights
behave<00:01:10.500> correctly<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> we're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> go

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
behave correctly so we're going to go

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.440 
behave correctly so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.200> create<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
ahead and go to create and I'm going to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
ahead and go to create and I'm going to
my<00:01:15.600> measuring<00:01:15.960> tool<00:01:16.229> distance<00:01:16.920> tool<00:01:17.210> when<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
my measuring tool distance tool when I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.990 
my measuring tool distance tool when I
click<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.369> ship<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> goes

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
click here and use your ship so it goes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
click here and use your ship so it goes
up<00:01:21.150> though<00:01:21.420> straight<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.799> any<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> says<00:01:23.580> 12

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
up though straight up any see it says 12

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
up though straight up any see it says 12
point<00:01:24.270> six<00:01:24.630> eight<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.490> won't<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.580> ahead<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
point six eight and won't go ahead and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.010 
point six eight and won't go ahead and
go<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> my<00:01:27.270> channel<00:01:27.930> editor<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.750> what<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.869> want

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
go to my channel editor and what we want

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.999 
go to my channel editor and what we want
to<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:32.630> sizes<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:34.520> right<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:36.619> 12.6<00:01:37.619> eight

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to do is sizes up right now 12.6 eight

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
to do is sizes up right now 12.6 eight
is<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.610> small<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:40.229> our<00:01:40.470> light<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
is very small so we want our light to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.399 
is very small so we want our light to
behave<00:01:41.189> correctly<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.180> were<00:01:42.409> using

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
behave correctly so if we were using

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
behave correctly so if we were using
this<00:01:43.680> room<00:01:43.979> probably<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.880> nine<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.210> ten

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this room probably one or nine or ten

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
this room probably one or nine or ten
foot<00:01:45.840> range<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> sign

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
foot range so what we want to do is sign

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.460 
foot range so what we want to do is sign
us<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:50.750> calculated<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.960> probably<00:01:52.350> about

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
us up if we calculated it probably about

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670 
us up if we calculated it probably about
300<00:01:53.070> five<00:01:53.399> three<00:01:54.329> hundred<00:01:54.659> centimeters<00:01:55.500> with

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
300 five three hundred centimeters with

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.430 
300 five three hundred centimeters with
equal<00:01:56.100> 9<00:01:56.460> feet<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.469> ahead

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
equal 9 feet so what we do is go ahead

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.560 
equal 9 feet so what we do is go ahead
instead<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> pulling<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.610> how<00:02:00.910> I<00:02:00.940> guess<00:02:01.330> do

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
instead of pulling this how I guess do

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.380 
instead of pulling this how I guess do
it<00:02:01.660> numerically<00:02:01.870> hit<00:02:02.500> 305<00:02:03.280> hit<00:02:03.640> enter<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:05.050> go

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
it numerically hit 305 hit enter and go

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it numerically hit 305 hit enter and go
ahead<00:02:07.860> zouk<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.100> out<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:09.820> see<00:02:10.119> from<00:02:11.080> here

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
ahead zouk this out and see from here

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.340 
ahead zouk this out and see from here
here<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.980> definitely<00:02:12.580> need<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.760> resize<00:02:13.510> this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
here we definitely need to resize this

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.870 
here we definitely need to resize this
seat<00:02:15.010> all<00:02:15.940> right<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.390> go<00:02:16.630> ahead<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:21.730> ahead

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
seat all right so I go ahead go ahead

my<00:03:32.530> objects<00:03:33.160> are<00:03:33.370> scaled<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.180> but<00:03:34.540> now<00:03:34.750> they're

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
my objects are scaled up but now they're

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.140 
my objects are scaled up but now they're
acting<00:03:35.530> independently<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.880> i'll<00:03:36.970> go<00:03:37.120> ahead

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
acting independently so i'll go ahead

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.780
