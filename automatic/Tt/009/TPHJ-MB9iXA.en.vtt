one was slippin and then when I put in
was<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> used<00:00:11.429> transmission<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.300> was<00:00:12.450> out

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
was a used transmission but it was out

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.169 
was a used transmission but it was out
of<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.719> car<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> believed<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of a car that I believed it was to be a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
of a car that I believed it was to be a
good<00:00:15.360> transmission<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.949> started

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
good transmission and it started

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.960 
good transmission and it started
slipping<00:00:17.430> too<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> pulled<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.160> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
slipping too so I pulled it out and I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150 
slipping too so I pulled it out and I
went<00:00:21.180> bought<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.660> new<00:00:22.020> transmission<00:00:22.500> all

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
went bought a new transmission all

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.779 
went bought a new transmission all
rebuilt<00:00:23.640> professionally<00:00:25.160> got<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.609> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
rebuilt professionally got it all put in

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.419 
rebuilt professionally got it all put in
and<00:00:26.970> everything<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.300> can't<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> thought

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
and everything I can't but I thought

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.679 
and everything I can't but I thought
before<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> did<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.269> change<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.660> my

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
before I did that I would change out my

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.190 
before I did that I would change out my
flywheel<00:00:31.850> my<00:00:32.850> old<00:00:33.059> fly<00:00:33.270> wheels<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.960> bad

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
flywheel my old fly wheels not that bad

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.130 
flywheel my old fly wheels not that bad
but<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.829> had<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> few<00:00:35.040> teeth<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.640> were<00:00:35.760> sharp

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
but it had a few teeth that were sharp

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.340 
but it had a few teeth that were sharp
so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.670> bought<00:00:38.670> me<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> new<00:00:39.090> flywheel<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.809> put<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
so I bought me a new flywheel and put it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.400 
so I bought me a new flywheel and put it
in<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.040> all<00:00:41.160> bolted<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
in there got it all bolted on and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
in there got it all bolted on and
discovered<00:00:43.410> when<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.160> ready<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> both<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
discovered when I got ready to both the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
discovered when I got ready to both the
torque<00:00:45.480> converter<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> flywheel<00:00:48.200> these

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
torque converter to the flywheel these

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.790 
torque converter to the flywheel these
holes<00:00:49.620> were<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.190> different<00:00:50.370> position<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
holes were in a different position so I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.880 
holes were in a different position so I
had<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> pull<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.399> flywheel<00:00:53.879> back<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.860> now<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
had to pull the flywheel back off now I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350 
had to pull the flywheel back off now I
didn't<00:00:56.129> pull<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.309> transmission<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
didn't pull the transmission all the way

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
didn't pull the transmission all the way
out<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> job's<00:00:59.430> beating<00:01:00.120> me

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
out I mean I'm at this job's beating me

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
out I mean I'm at this job's beating me
up<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.629> telling<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.699> what<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> did<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
up I'm telling you what what I did is I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.649 
up I'm telling you what what I did is I
put<00:01:03.979> some<00:01:04.979> long<00:01:05.189> pegs<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> transmission

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
put some long pegs on the transmission

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.240 
put some long pegs on the transmission
and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.369> slid<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> transmission<00:01:09.540> back

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
and I just slid the transmission back

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
and I just slid the transmission back
that<00:01:11.250> allowed<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> five<00:01:12.630> wheel

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that allowed me to get the five wheel

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.980 
that allowed me to get the five wheel
out<00:01:13.110> without<00:01:13.439> having<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> completely<00:01:14.430> undo

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
out without having to completely undo

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:29.300 
out without having to completely undo
everything<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:20.270> did<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:28.310> pulling

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
everything I did not want to be pulling

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
everything I did not want to be pulling
this<00:01:29.520> transmission<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> third<00:01:30.659> time

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this transmission out for the third time

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
this transmission out for the third time
as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> long<00:01:32.520> bolt<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
as you can see I put a long bolt in the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
as you can see I put a long bolt in the
bottom<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:35.520> slide<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
bottom down there to just slide the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
bottom down there to just slide the
transmission<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
transmission on but see what that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.260 
transmission on but see what that
allowed<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.670> allowed<00:01:41.909> me<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> get

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.370 
allowed me to do that allowed me to get
the<00:01:42.390> flywheel<00:01:42.869> out<00:01:44.899> without<00:01:45.899> having<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> pull

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the flywheel out without having to pull

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.219 
the flywheel out without having to pull
the<00:01:46.500> transmission<00:01:46.710> completely<00:01:47.430> off

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
the transmission completely off

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.460 
the transmission completely off
that's<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.380> new<00:01:49.560> transmission<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> all

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that's my new transmission it's got all

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
that's my new transmission it's got all
kinds<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:52.979> stuff<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.850> wait

kinds of good stuff in it I can't wait

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.440 
kinds of good stuff in it I can't wait
to<00:01:54.090> try<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:55.969> but<00:01:56.969> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.119> ever<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.360> to

to try it out but if you ever have to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.940 
to try it out but if you ever have to
replace<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> flywheel<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> done

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
replace a flywheel it can be done

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
replace a flywheel it can be done
without<00:02:01.950> pulling<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> whole<00:02:03.119> transmission<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
without pulling the whole transmission I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
without pulling the whole transmission I
even<00:02:04.619> left<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> rear<00:02:05.100> transmission<00:02:05.759> mount

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
even left the rear transmission mount

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.410 
even left the rear transmission mount
end<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:07.049> able<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> slide<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> back

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the pans hitting my Mount but I was able

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.980 
the pans hitting my Mount but I was able
to<00:02:14.230> slide<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.590> back<00:02:14.770> enough<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.340> get<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.990> five

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
to slide it back enough to get that five

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.950 
to slide it back enough to get that five
