00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.210 
grab things so I think you know when
someone<00:02:20.780> does<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.470> if<00:02:21.680> he<00:02:21.800> gets<00:02:21.890> second

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
someone does one and if he gets second

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.160 
someone does one and if he gets second
than<00:02:22.310> someone<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.670> they<00:02:22.970> respects<00:02:23.480> as<00:02:23.630> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170

dropped real quick the sushi roll is
something<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.860> mean<00:03:17.310> even<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> time

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
something that I mean even at the time

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.660 
something that I mean even at the time
when<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> did<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.410> was<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:20.040> something<00:03:20.520> that

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
when I did it it was not something that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.250 
when I did it it was not something that
I<00:03:20.790> thought<00:03:21.030> about<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.720> was<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.050> like

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
I thought about it was just like

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.870 
I thought about it was just like
something<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.070> happened<00:03:23.550> when<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> was

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
something that happened when I was

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:40.220 
something that happened when I was
pulling<00:03:24.090> off<00:03:24.240> away

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.870 

you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.830> think<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.310> person<00:03:41.730> who's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
you know I think the person who's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.940 
you know I think the person who's
leading<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.900> charge<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.560> inventing

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
leading the charge on inventing

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.750 
leading the charge on inventing
maneuvers<00:03:44.430> probably<00:03:45.410> Joschka<00:03:46.410> I'd<00:03:46.770> say<00:03:47.010> he's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
maneuvers probably Joschka I'd say he's

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.190 
maneuvers probably Joschka I'd say he's
come<00:03:48.420> up<00:03:48.569> with<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:48.870> many<00:03:48.959> different

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
come up with so many different

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.070 
come up with so many different
variations<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.520> grabs<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.330> obviously<00:03:51.930> him

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
variations of grabs and obviously him

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.780 
variations of grabs and obviously him
coming<00:03:52.410> from<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> air<00:03:52.830> show<00:03:53.040> background<00:03:53.520> he's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
coming from the air show background he's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.690 
coming from the air show background he's
you<00:03:54.480> know<00:03:54.510> he<00:03:54.660> has<00:03:55.230> been<00:03:55.260> kind<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:56.040> at<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
you know he has been kind of at the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.809 
you know he has been kind of at the
forefront<00:03:56.850> for<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.750> while<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:59.220> don't<00:03:59.580> know
