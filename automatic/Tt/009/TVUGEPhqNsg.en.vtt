00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good is 100,000 t die right but 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.310
 video lesson this video lesson today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 personal to who's seeing for the first 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.800
 time it 's about how to make a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 house goes easy on the fifth video if 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 Has anyone seen images retired? 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 just go there on my son there you go 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 see every day of the first shift this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 It's the fifth video any just now we 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.109
 we are a match in the recording of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 shoes what I advise poetry and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.219
 let's make a 84- by-84 feedback that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 cent you come here will give 80 by 80 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.739
 in the other video in the previous video and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.390
 how to mark the center of this paws 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 I will not take this feedback in this video 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.149
 and we'll put it on the floor where it's going to be 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820
 dug this page for us we ended up 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.739
 inside the plate with the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 horses within this template and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.449
 Let's make a mark on the chair. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 iron and we were attacking what we are digging 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.719
 we will stay until now in the menopause 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.719
 that deserves 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 good people just remembering and there's the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 capsule does not like it here 8080 and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.840
 Let's go to work the new horses. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:22.140
 to the ground that's complicated, it's good, we're just going 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.439
 back there pro the project teaches the house is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 that I did here it will be 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.630
 placed here person note speaking well 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.990
 cool for you are crazy here guys 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.159
 the iron chair means I know 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:45.210
 You're going to mark that angle here. 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.590
 here and back from the end of the template all there 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.290
 just remembering here that have that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.869
 That one I came back to the center 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.439
 You're going to get me 40 from one side 40 to 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.719
 the other and will demarcate make holding the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.520
 to mark all the steps of ok alone 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.659
 reminding one more thing personally 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 these foundations I 'm doing here 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.229
 suppose that it is a foundation that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.810
 I'm doing it, we will not have to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 I know that I have already done a poll of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.819
 ground because I can not way to 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.099
 humiliate 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.290
 to mobilize for someone to make a foundation 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.280
 in these patterns that I'm putting 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.889
 here because this is just an example 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.689
 this is not suitable for any kind of 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.450
 terrain has terrain and will vary 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.849
 this can range from 80 by 80 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.920
 up to two meters deep will 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.230
 vary a lot from soil to soil 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.099
 so I can not blame me alone 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.989
 at 18 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.669
 here it is as if I had already seen the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.549
 and I'm starting to 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.620
 Quito is the foundation with the criteria 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.959
 the standards with the standard is perfect and 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.489
 dictate the construction is ok 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.060
 that's all I want to remember you 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.389
 type and come on let's check all the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.849
 shoes there with the help of a 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.459
 spade is shown here 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.540
 the sawing machine and we will mark 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.609
 all 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.730
 after we arrange everything would 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.680
 we may need to dig mine 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.519
 if here as I have done the probing of the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.099
 ground 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.400
 vi which is a soil is tough I 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.759
 I put these foundations 80 by 80 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.699
 It's what I 'm saying will vary 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:24.549
 of land for the land 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.470
 ball for solo personal touch since 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.379
 we mark them all it's time to 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.569
 horses all in shoes here in my 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.669
 if you gave the shoe here 18 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.189
 possibility of doing what to diminish 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.280
 very good to take but these three here 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.199
 and these three here and we make an agency 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.449
 I'm not going to explain it in that 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.099
 video because this is a little more 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:51.040
 complicated to understand and make the necessary 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.199
 for specifically this in my case 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.329
 here's how to make the foundations 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:04:00.129
 so let's respect all the foundations 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:02.349
 I played the next video now I go 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.509
 do I will teach how to make iha 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.540
 money ends up voting here 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:09.870
 that of the dhaka knives and how concrete 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.490
 this here correctly personal touch 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.890
 next video I'll explain how 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.989
 a treaty properly and how we do 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.110
 there the garden and then we share 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.450
 may be right and feeling ok 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.550
 and so on, I hope everyone has 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.380
 understood only by remembering one more thing 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.330
 I am not responsible for any work 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.640
 that is built away from 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.030
 reach that can not be present 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.210
 invent 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.370
 this is just an explanatory one for him 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.580
 has enough technical knowledge that 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.910
 I'm doing here and have sound standards. 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.550
 of the various chances, but the soil alone 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.590
 that will vary is for one floor only 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.080
 some 5 16 that the most 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.940
 recommended for a floor and so on 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.590
 I'm not going here, it's coming in a lot. 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.260
 detail now but is as follows in 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.030
 Next video now we're gonna put 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.010
 the radio in all goes away let's go 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.960
 to concretise I'm going to teach the way 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.830
 correct to be uploading these parts 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.660
 column and hardware to teach 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.850
 correct way will also be mounting 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.970
 the hardware and so on 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.820
 We're going to stay easy to rule. 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.680
 then need is ok 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.810
 a big hug to everyone at home you 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.430
 is watching this video was not arrested if 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.100
 sign up for the channel that I'm going to post this 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.860
 then step by step this house will be made 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.840
 from the foundation to the ceiling , I hope 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.250
 everyone accompany the strong hug to all 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.250
 who are about to leave the site
