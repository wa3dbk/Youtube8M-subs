00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.010 
really really different because staking
now<00:02:27.710> goes<00:02:27.980> by<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.550> really<00:02:28.940> fast<00:02:29.240> which

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
now goes by really really fast which

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.910 
now goes by really really fast which
means

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
means

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.670 
means
can<00:02:31.190> get<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.640> lot<00:02:31.970> more<00:02:32.000> fucking<00:02:32.690> kills<00:02:32.990> the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
can get a lot more fucking kills the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.790 
can get a lot more fucking kills the
only<00:02:33.980> downside<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.720> really<00:02:36.319> based

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
only downside is that it's really based

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.240 
only downside is that it's really based
off<00:02:37.099> chaotic<00:02:37.940> rapier<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.599> CLS<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:39.980> as<00:02:40.099> you

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
off chaotic rapier or CLS but as you

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.180 
off chaotic rapier or CLS but as you
guys<00:02:40.340> may<00:02:40.700> see<00:02:40.760> see<00:02:41.090> over<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:42.190> these
