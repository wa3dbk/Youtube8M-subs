00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 this house inspired by a hut 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.750
 shepherd is perfectly integrated with the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.269
 door 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.719
 it is hidden by a blanket 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.719
 vegetable 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.000
 stone and vincent are expected by 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 the architect jean manuel puig and the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.079
 owner stone miller and small 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.110
 shepherd's son is from the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.970
 valley 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.829
 five years ago he undertakes to do 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.090
 enlarge an old barn on this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.629
 terrain which allows you to have a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.030
 an insertion the architect then creates a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.510
 independent building and decides on the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 to melt in the landscape 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.850
 and for that he imagines this immense 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.230
 Bay window 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 the idea was of something thoroughly 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.750
 modest white discreet home 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.850
 main is the renovated barn 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 this is a small extension he was not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630
 no question of doing something 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.250
 ostentatious 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's putting in nature and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.549
 to expand nurture that years when one is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.549
 in we are in the landscape 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 this house originated age of 72 meters 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:24.149
 squares only has two pieces one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.170
 huge living room and a bedroom too 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.170
 open on the mountain 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.850
 to build it the owner asked 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.780
 the architect to use only 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.890
 materials produced in the region 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.450
 the worst is the stone of the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.120
 mountain the floor is the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.040
 chestnut from the corner when a winter I 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
 am sitting in my chair in front of my 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.250
 stove and that I listen as I look at the 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.650
 sheep that are ours is the window 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.450
 who do not see that they are 20 cm who 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.520
 Who is riding on the logs 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.170
 who look and who do not see me I 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.820
 tell me the grandfather and successful lice sure 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.300
 that they would be there to bring in more 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.960
 light 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.610
 the architect had an idea create this 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.610
 long glass opening in the roof 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.090
 plays the role of a light gun the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.350
 light it goes down but when we are 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.050
 at the bottom we do not know where she came from 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.150
 here in the back and she illuminates the wall 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:29.440
 in stone is really very pretty 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:31.270
 house seduces the two friends to make a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 green roof today that goes with 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.630
 all all the research entrusts on the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.950
 sustainable development we sought 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.459
 materials to use materials 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.470
 local 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.300
 it's hard to do better than 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.370
 put the land of the lawn took on 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 the ground rested on the roof it's 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.459
 what is more local we do not have 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.720

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.850
 slovakia i do not know where in between 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.160
 slates currently the material is said 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.320
