00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
 First of all we have to have a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 I leave the link in the description of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 unificado unificadora we're going to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.759
 direct us to the page where are I going to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.079
 leave the game 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.599
 let's wait 5 seconds of the 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.790
 advertising we give to guides 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.910
 scripts we go to a click 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.530
 let's remove this the publicity is us 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 usually download some let's put 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.290

 to leave here the game page 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.230
 of the torrent I prefer to put a dollar 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.170
 because sometimes the direct scale over 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.050
 take longer or advise to have errors in 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.920
 the archives therefore why 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.730
 from this page of the restaurants 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.750
 more secure we will not give to download 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.719

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.640
