00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
base kind of shaped narrow at the bottom

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.860

wide<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.860> top<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> they're<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.750> their

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
wide at the top and they're just their

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.860 
wide at the top and they're just their
natural<00:00:37.350> growth<00:00:37.969> these<00:00:38.969> trees<00:00:39.390> had<00:00:39.629> some

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
natural growth these trees had some

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.920 
natural growth these trees had some
great<00:00:40.260> trunks<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.489> I<00:00:44.570> bought<00:00:45.570> several

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
great trunks so I was I bought several

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
great trunks so I was I bought several
thinking<00:00:46.559> about<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> forest<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.550> cut<00:00:47.820> them<00:00:48.000> back

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
thinking about a forest I cut them back

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
thinking about a forest I cut them back
really<00:00:48.660> hard<00:00:49.020> both<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> roots<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
really hard both the roots and the the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.270 
really hard both the roots and the the
tops<00:00:54.140> kept<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.620> them<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.829> 1<00:00:56.070> gallon

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tops kept them put them in 1 gallon

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
tops kept them put them in 1 gallon
containers<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.420> eventually<00:00:57.899> after<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
containers and then eventually after a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.310 
containers and then eventually after a
couple<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> months<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> ground

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
couple of months put them in the ground

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
couple of months put them in the ground
they've<00:01:01.320> done<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:02.039> well<00:01:02.399> they've<00:01:02.730> come

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
they've done really well they've come

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.440 
they've done really well they've come
back<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.600> strong<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:05.189> foliage<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.000> thick

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
back really strong the foliage is thick

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.140 
back really strong the foliage is thick
and<00:01:06.780> dark<00:01:07.229> green<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:08.220> growing<00:01:08.729> lushly

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.560 

you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:13.430> pretty<00:01:14.430> nice-looking<00:01:14.760> trunks

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
you can see pretty nice-looking trunks

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.230 
you can see pretty nice-looking trunks
on<00:01:15.720> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.430> these<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.820> buried

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
on some of these these are just buried

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
on some of these these are just buried
in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> ground<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.530> their<00:01:19.740> containers<00:01:20.189> I'm

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
in the ground in their containers I'm

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.249 
in the ground in their containers I'm
sure<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> roots<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.450> escaped<00:01:21.869> into<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sure the roots have escaped into the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
sure the roots have escaped into the
ground<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> shovel<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
ground I'm going to use a shovel and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.420 
ground I'm going to use a shovel and
start<00:01:25.020> digging<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.619> up

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.980 

I<00:01:30.520> suppose<00:01:32.790> here's<00:01:33.790> one<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.330> was<00:01:34.450> originally

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
I suppose here's one that was originally

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.150 
I suppose here's one that was originally
put<00:01:35.230> into<00:01:35.620> a<00:01:35.650> bonsai<00:01:36.130> pot<00:01:36.960> instead<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
put into a bonsai pot instead of in the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.030 
put into a bonsai pot instead of in the
one<00:01:39.880> gallon<00:01:40.240> container<00:01:40.270> it's<00:01:41.230> amazing<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
one gallon container it's amazing the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.890 
one gallon container it's amazing the
difference<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> foliage<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.479> how<00:01:43.690> much

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
difference in the foliage and how much

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.400 
difference in the foliage and how much
more<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:44.500> are<00:01:44.560> grown<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:46.720> at<00:01:46.870> that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
more these are grown look at that

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.330 
more these are grown look at that
compared<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:49.500> okay<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:51.130> guy's

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
compared to this okay so this guy's

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.630 
compared to this okay so this guy's
going<00:01:51.580> back<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.030> ground<00:01:52.240> filling<00:01:52.840> them

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
going back on the ground filling them

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.400 
going back on the ground filling them
all<00:01:54.640> right<00:01:54.850> after<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.360> after<00:01:55.780> coming<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.350> of

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
all right after that after coming out of

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.750 
all right after that after coming out of
the<00:01:56.530> ground<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.160> kind<00:01:57.430> of<00:01:57.490> what<00:01:57.610> they

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
the ground this is kind of what they

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.980 
the ground this is kind of what they
looked<00:01:57.970> like<00:02:00.180> here's<00:02:01.180> just<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.510> couple<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.990> them

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
looked like here's just a couple of them

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.359 
looked like here's just a couple of them
from<00:02:04.990> there<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.530> trimmed<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.890> roots<00:02:06.100> I

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
from there I just trimmed the roots I

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.190 
from there I just trimmed the roots I
took<00:02:06.610> them<00:02:06.820> took<00:02:07.060> them<00:02:07.210> out<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.570> pots<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
took them took them out of the pots and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.690 
took them took them out of the pots and
then<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.739> started<00:02:09.459> really<00:02:09.820> pruning<00:02:10.540> i<00:02:10.660> pruned

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
then I started really pruning i pruned

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.100 
then I started really pruning i pruned
anywhere<00:02:12.700> there<00:02:12.880> were<00:02:12.970> long<00:02:13.180> shoots<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.750> pruned

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
anywhere there were long shoots I pruned

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.300 
anywhere there were long shoots I pruned
them<00:02:14.200> back<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.930> probably<00:02:16.930> took<00:02:17.140> two<00:02:17.650> hours<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
them back so probably took two hours to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.790 
them back so probably took two hours to
prune<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.420> these<00:02:19.570> guys<00:02:19.840> back<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.620> get

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
prune all of these guys back and get

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.729 
prune all of these guys back and get
them<00:02:20.980> ready<00:02:21.810> okay<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.140> they<00:02:23.290> are<00:02:23.320> pretty

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
them ready okay here they are pretty

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.580 
them ready okay here they are pretty
much<00:02:23.950> ready<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.750> root<00:02:25.959> balls<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.560> been

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
much ready the root balls have been

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
much ready the root balls have been
moved<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.940> been<00:02:28.090> cleaned<00:02:29.250> roots<00:02:30.250> exposed

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
moved have been cleaned roots exposed

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.789 
moved have been cleaned roots exposed
all<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.870> foliage<00:02:32.140> has<00:02:32.560> been<00:02:32.800> pruned<00:02:37.590> ready<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
all the foliage has been pruned ready to

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.430 
all the foliage has been pruned ready to
start<00:02:39.299> putting<00:02:40.299> them<00:02:40.450> together<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.170> trying

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
start putting them together and trying

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
start putting them together and trying
to<00:02:41.500> arrange<00:02:41.860> them<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.549> see<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.940> trunks

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
to arrange them you can see the trunks

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:57.720 
to arrange them you can see the trunks
now<00:02:46.570> some<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.170> roots

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.760 

trying<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.390> decide<00:02:58.660> which<00:02:58.870> container<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.530> use

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
trying to decide which container to use

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.040 
trying to decide which container to use
I'm<00:03:00.489> going<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.730> end<00:03:00.849> up<00:03:00.970> using<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.450> larger

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
I'm going to end up using this larger

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.690 
I'm going to end up using this larger
container<00:03:02.500> 30<00:03:03.310> inches<00:03:03.819> by<00:03:04.120> about<00:03:04.270> 19<00:03:05.520> just<00:03:06.520> was

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
container 30 inches by about 19 just was

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.490 
container 30 inches by about 19 just was
afraid<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.209> one<00:03:07.420> wasn't<00:03:07.959> quite<00:03:08.230> large

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
afraid this one wasn't quite large

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.339 
afraid this one wasn't quite large
enough<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.760> end<00:03:09.940> now<00:03:10.330> that<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.630> over<00:03:10.810> it

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
enough in the end now that it's over it

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.640 
enough in the end now that it's over it
may<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.860> been<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.959> container<00:03:14.410> they're

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
may have been but the container they're

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.759 
may have been but the container they're
in<00:03:15.090> may<00:03:16.090> be<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.300> little<00:03:16.569> bit<00:03:16.720> large<00:03:16.989> but<00:03:17.200> they'll

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
in may be a little bit large but they'll

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.130 
in may be a little bit large but they'll
be<00:03:17.890> happy<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:18.849> I'm<00:03:19.360> comfortable<00:03:19.989> with

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
be happy in it so I'm comfortable with

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.610 
be happy in it so I'm comfortable with
that<00:03:20.610> here<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:21.700> go<00:03:21.880> again<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.300> playing<00:03:22.810> I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that here we go again just playing I

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.850 
that here we go again just playing I
think<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> keys<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:25.860> creating

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
think one of the keys to creating

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.860 
think one of the keys to creating
natural-looking<00:03:27.610> forests<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.360> trying<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.810> eat

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
natural-looking forests is trying to eat

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.539 
natural-looking forests is trying to eat
the<00:03:28.989> trunks<00:03:29.319> really<00:03:29.590> close<00:03:29.860> together<00:03:30.069> I

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the trunks really close together I

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.670 
the trunks really close together I
worked<00:03:31.120> hard<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.989> don't<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.470> lot

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
worked hard on this I don't have a lot

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
worked hard on this I don't have a lot
of<00:03:32.709> pictures<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.340> show<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.180> worked<00:03:34.690> on

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
of pictures that show it but I worked on

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.350 
of pictures that show it but I worked on
these<00:03:35.019> root<00:03:35.290> balls<00:03:38.730> finding<00:03:39.730> places<00:03:39.940> where<00:03:40.330> I

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
these root balls finding places where I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.210 
these root balls finding places where I
could<00:03:40.660> notch<00:03:40.930> them<00:03:41.260> out<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:41.799> them<00:03:41.980> really

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
could notch them out and get them really

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.089 
could notch them out and get them really
close<00:03:42.580> together<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:43.269> use<00:03:43.750> wire<00:03:44.170> around<00:03:44.560> two

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
close together I use wire around two

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.940 
close together I use wire around two
trees<00:03:45.549> tied<00:03:45.989> pulled<00:03:46.989> tight<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.560> my<00:03:47.709> gin

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
trees tied pulled tight with my gin

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.979 
trees tied pulled tight with my gin
pliers<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.610> teat<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.120> pull<00:03:49.299> them<00:03:49.450> even<00:03:49.690> closer

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
pliers to teat and pull them even closer

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.270 
pliers to teat and pull them even closer
together<00:03:51.900> alright<00:03:52.900> there's<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.709> pot<00:03:53.950> wired

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
together alright there's the pot wired

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.979

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
up ready to go yep you can see it's 30

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.780 
up ready to go yep you can see it's 30
inches<00:03:59.380> long

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
inches long

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.509 
inches long
alright<00:04:00.790> after<00:04:01.320> probably<00:04:02.320> an<00:04:02.799> hour<00:04:03.070> of

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
alright after probably an hour of

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.780 
alright after probably an hour of
playing<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.329> trying<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.840> adjust<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.959> is<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
playing and trying to adjust this is the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.759 
playing and trying to adjust this is the
planet<00:04:09.790> image<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:10.750> how<00:04:10.840> are<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.079> final<00:04:11.440> image

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
planet image so how are the final image

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.099 
planet image so how are the final image
I<00:04:12.040> had<00:04:12.819> fun<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.359> little<00:04:13.510> putting<00:04:13.810> little

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
I had fun with a little putting little

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.159 
I had fun with a little putting little
rocks<00:04:14.319> in

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.460 

the<00:04:19.590> rocks<00:04:19.799> probably<00:04:20.400> won't<00:04:20.609> stay<00:04:20.909> but<00:04:21.470> they

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
the rocks probably won't stay but they

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.430 
the rocks probably won't stay but they
were<00:04:22.530> fun<00:04:22.860> for<00:04:23.069> now<00:04:24.050> eventually<00:04:25.050> they'll<00:04:25.409> come

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
were fun for now eventually they'll come

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.750 
were fun for now eventually they'll come
out

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.610 

I<00:04:30.880> think<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.570> trunks<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.050> these<00:04:32.170> trees<00:04:32.440> are

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
I think the trunks on these trees are

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.610 
I think the trunks on these trees are
just<00:04:32.650> fantastic<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.550> roots<00:04:34.230> just<00:04:35.230> reaching

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
just fantastic the roots just reaching

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.750 
just fantastic the roots just reaching
out<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.800> grabbing<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.400> ground<00:04:37.170> look<00:04:38.170> good

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.940 

but<00:04:42.760> this<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.870> one<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.080> those<00:04:44.230> things<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:44.740> it

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
but this is one of those things that it

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.410 
but this is one of those things that it
looks<00:04:45.070> like<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.370> did<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:45.820> today<00:04:45.940> but

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
looks like I just did it today but

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.210 
looks like I just did it today but
really<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.780> started<00:04:47.260> preparing<00:04:47.800> for<00:04:47.980> this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
really I started preparing for this

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.720 
really I started preparing for this
forest<00:04:48.640> two<00:04:48.850> summers<00:04:49.390> ago<00:04:49.950> by<00:04:50.950> pruning<00:04:51.460> those

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
forest two summers ago by pruning those

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.440 
forest two summers ago by pruning those
trees<00:04:52.030> hard<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.740> anyhow<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.700> hope<00:04:54.940> you<00:04:55.090> enjoyed

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
trees hard but anyhow I hope you enjoyed

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.660 
trees hard but anyhow I hope you enjoyed
it

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
it

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.600 
it
there's<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:57.880> side<00:04:58.120> views
