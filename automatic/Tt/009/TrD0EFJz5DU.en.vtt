00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.330
 hello to all gold I find you for 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.430
 a new tutorial video about your 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.349
 own bridal then this tutorial has 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.210
 been filmed almost a year ago when 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.970
 I made an order for a young 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 Bride and I had been asked for the break 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.680
 so was I filmed I had it 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.360
 never ever come up first when 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 you make a dress like that makes the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 wool but in the sense that you put 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.570
 aluminum foil if we l 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.820
 use for the dress the 4.2 chimot 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.270
 white it's useless you make a 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 aluminum base like I did and cover 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.910
 of white and then we start doing the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.710
 effects in such as to be required in a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.060
 order so here I leave you 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.870
 watch because I always do the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.329
 same movements knowing that at a 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.259
 certain moment i'm going to bounce back and a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.180
 little just because I had it I you 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.570
 lets watch admits to adjust after 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 control 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460
 2 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 I do not hide it from you 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.210
 very slow tutorial I know more how much 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.420
 of time I had put for losses and rob 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.590
 but it takes a lot of time 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.170
 already because you order me can 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:59.789
 do it right and that's very 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:02:04.049
 careful do not hesitate to help you 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.679
 utensils for modeling small and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:12.870
 henchmen finally small pieces of 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:15.769
 fabrics actually that limit and that will make 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.769
 even more 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.620
 that's what it's already doing that's great 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.620
 pretty 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.230
 so we'll start doing the bust 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.850
 so you're not going to really see 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.580
 big thing for the bus because I have 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.560
 really privileged the round that the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.770
 rest 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.540
 but after the pot the more you put in 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.680
 the flesh color for the skin and you 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.720
 come back with white over 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.720
 to really make chest Moscow 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.910
 So here at the end what happens 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.060
 see I did not show it 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:26.920
 lasted an eternity and I find the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.720
 result rather not bad here after 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.820
 you to do with the 3d deco of the 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.440
 end of June all you want 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.540
 small effect to asome things like 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.430
 this and here I hope that the tutorial has you
