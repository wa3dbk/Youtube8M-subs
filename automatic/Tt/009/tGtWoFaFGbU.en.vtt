00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.979
 Hello today, we catch the probe again 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.280
 dress about the same place as the previous one 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.190
 once the pastor of the form of authority 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.160
 or something is near the village 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.830
 Sergievskaya river upa 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.290
 the moment we caught the barge the river now how 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 I want to show what tackle 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.570
 how are we war for what expects us 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.810
 here it is, the hook is pretty small 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.820
 especially for when pike is laying and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.280
 she always swallows a hook from her head 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.470
 bent and calmly passes her to fall 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.720
 That is, when hooking hooks straight 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.880
 immediately pulled out and cuts the right 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.450
 part and where will it be so to speak 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.280
 be 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.559
 steel snood pretty 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.989
 thin how to graft it is a soft tenant 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.239
 gently floats plays then there are no 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.910
 especially not to test here 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.059
 the weights are selected under the float float 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.280
 i don't like big ones i like sieve small 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.920
 there roughly speaking there 3-4 grams of answer 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.590
 sheet music asshole gudgeon pretty easy 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.590
 embed it so if you are now 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 take a look 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.850
 so we threw it now 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.440
 squeak 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.720
 goes in one place with a float 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 here you see yes everything he went here for me 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.350
 this is not a problem because 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.190
 given directly and always catching 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 live bait I hold the fishing rod in my hand 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 quietly so lift it up 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.009
 I create him the opportunity to find a pike 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.400
 have to go deeper 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.820
 climb go down go up 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.490
 the tenant is not practiced and his task on 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.560
 all 100 percent because when 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.300
 girl with a divided iron depth not 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.979
 can lower this navel if he 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.930
 big interrogate how cleverly he is and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.600
 swims at the same depth 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 Well, what if at the moment is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.630
 arson catfish took all pike here you see 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.400
 right just started raising the frame 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.340
 Immediately blow here is not even necessary 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.380
 something drowsiness wait for such health 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.210
 floats or are there looking at things 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.810
 did enough throw small 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.149
 navels 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
 with a little close text here and 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.230
 play with fish and you play 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 play and all here is a little hook 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.540
 Now pike long ago just swallow 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.730
 I apologize for the expression to guts and when 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.160
 he must not jump out 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.840
 legs puts workouts pike doubles 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.330
 it's pretty hard to pay them if 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.250
 this is not a big pike here but in this 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.209
 case i think everything will be fine and we 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.830
 Now we will leave a little bit, we must wait 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.640
 here you can see where is my 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.720
 fishing line that's not stored will not give a and here 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.360
 I even see through the clear water where my 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.840
 Poor is at the moment 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.300
 believed bitch hold 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.140
 not very famous 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.280
 the position is literally small 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.879
 a wave of the hand and the fish will already forgive me 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.879
 my hook 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.799
 yes yes of course wait for the time that she 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.069
 he was swallowed by the usual as expecting himself 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.690
 Here pike took it goes to its place 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.269
 to the place where she is always him 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.549
 swallows it can be out you 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.110
 from where it is thrown in 5 meters 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.150
 from the place where she wedge she can 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.370
 generally we go this complexity I always 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.180
 let go of the forest so she left all 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.019
 stopped 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 here at this moment she lively spits 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.110
 corrects him as he needs to 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.650
 it was easier to grab squats 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.019

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.980
