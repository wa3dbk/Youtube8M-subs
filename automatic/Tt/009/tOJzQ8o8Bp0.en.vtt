00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.330
 on a cold and rainy night 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.430
 a man is alone in the living room of his house 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.510
 his family slept 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.639
 It was 2 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:10.889
 in the morning 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 the one of sitting in his favorite armchair 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.199
 I had a coffee while thinking about taxco sas that worried me 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.679
 so much so that he lost track of time 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.749
 he wanted to take another ccaa 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.899
 it was the kitchen to prepare it in that state 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.749
 when he felt a chill 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.530
 that has already traveled the back 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.339
 quito 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.720
 and there I was 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.330
 sitting 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.650
 looking at it fixed the man could not believe what he saw 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 but he only had to resign himself 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 everything was lost 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.490
 death told him 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.490
 person who among themselves and marcelo usually 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.980
 I'm not welcome 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.219
 I imagine 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.520
 and you know what he has come 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.840
 Yes I know 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.100
 my hour arrived 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 surprised death said 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.550
 you will not cry 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 to get on your knees and plead for more time 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.720
 ensure that you're going to be a better person 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.470
 how do they all do 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.000
 fearful the man told him 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.020
 what's the use and day would you never give me another chance 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.390
 you only meet 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.710
 with your work 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 in that he is right 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.240
 I do not decide the time nor the place nor the 6th 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.470
 I can say goodbye to at least my family 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.700
 I'm sorry context death is already late 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 he begged the man for the last time is that you do not understand 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.500
 I lost my father at 15 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 and suffer so much 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.590
 my youngest daughter 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.090
 he is only four years old 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.390
 let me say at least and I want it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.160
 and now you remember 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.080
 you had four years to say sex so many times parties and birthdays 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.150
 but 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.830
 because they are free 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.920
 the rest of his family 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 my eldest son and my wife could not possibly believe me 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.150
 we are a little distanced 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.559
 for work my things in order 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.680
 It was my fault I gave them 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.349
 so little time 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.889
 but my daughter 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.889
 As soon as he arrived home he always received me with a kiss 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:20.439
 good enough 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.209
 it is enough to take the Czech one finished the time 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.440
 this moment 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 makes people aware of how he lived 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.189
 pity that they do it too late 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.069
 both left the house 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.069
 and they took a strange train that was waiting for him 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.339
 you know said death 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.549
 I can not tell you what's happening 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.849
 arriving 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.299
 but tim watched playing chess while we traveled 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.729
 like to kill time 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.889
 the man smiled and said 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.269
 I noticed that I had 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.149
 with so much sense of humor 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.389
 not everything is what seems to be death context 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.869
 during the trip while playing chess 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.539
 death asked him 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.619
 in life that you spent 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.669
 he was an employee of a shoe factory 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.859
 again the death asked 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.509
 a little more serious 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.579
 because when they are alive 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.500
 having so many things to do they lock themselves in at work they forget 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.829
 feelings do not care about others 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.039
 they become selfish and violent 0 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.520
 when he visited them 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.600
 they show so hard humility sadness and even love 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.510
 because he wasted his life when they own it and can do what 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:37.359
 want 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.659
 evil 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.689
 without expressing love and love 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.189
 the truth I do not know answered the man to tell the truth 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.599
 c we wanted to run not with so much feeling 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.679
 is that they have only made me bad 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.969
 for not knowing the death context 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:56.480
 the man could not anymore 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.310
 and broke into an endless crying 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.670
 he understood 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.119
 how he had also wasted his life on things well or they were worth it 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.119
 silence reigns for an instant 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.549
 then 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.859
 the death said 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.179
 It's your turn to move 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.620
 the dry man south the yuma 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.939
 looked at the board 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.620
 he thought about the play 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.979
 moved the piece and said 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.979
 so sorry 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.279
 Death smiled and said I congratulate you you won the game 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.129
 pity that it does not help me 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.129
 it was the most valuable thing is to I lost my life my family 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.610
 everything lost 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.250
 again the man 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.740
 burst into tears 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.430
 Visit the face with your hands 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.599
 the death said 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.939
 sorry 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.080
 the trip is over 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.340
 and here we must separate 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.439
 while trying to calm down and drying her tears she opened her eyes 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.749
 he was armed in his house sitting in his favorite armchair 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.069
 he got up the crazy with joy and ran to the kitchen 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.069
 and so his family was hugged them and fixed him 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.110
 how much I wanted it 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.439
 how foolish he had been to have neglected him so much that from now on 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.870
 things 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.439
 things have changed 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.509
 his family hugged him and said 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.509
 that they also wanted it and needed it so much 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.450
 his youngest daughter asked him 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.439
 what happened to you dad 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.129
 you change so much 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.790
 is that I had a man 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.819
 who have a bad name 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.310
 We play chess 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.000
 and while we played chatting for a while and he left me 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.199
 a great teaching 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.370
 but dad did not tell me not to get together with bad people 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.550
 the PRD 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.039
 but this man 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.749
 I think it's not so bad 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.249
 they only chose bad reputation 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.180
 and before 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.979
 and that to believe 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.979
 and even let me win the game of chess 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:59.990
 what you have to do 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.190
 do it now because we are not born with a certificate of eternal life if you want to give 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.979
 A hug a kiss or tell someone who wants it is 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.090
 do it now do not stop 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.789
 do not wait for tomorrow 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.840
 because it is possible that chess game 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.910
 not in the d in playing
