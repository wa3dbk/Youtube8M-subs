00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.859
 so the reason for this video is something very 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 is how to raise the temperature of the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 water coming out of an electric faucet 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 this is the model of mothers is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 and this is a very 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.140
 very old the faucet I found 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.640
 this house that it was defective're 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.570
 a defect in resistance that was 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 changed 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 however she is warming coconut water 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 because they are probably are two 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.719
 factors that cause it first 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.880
 diaphragm that has inside that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.149
 moves when the pressure is formed from 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 water there in the toni people if he 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.480
 moves and connects the contacts beyond the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.320
 existence if such a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 shower 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 The problem is that with the passage of time 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 this diaphragm it becomes more and more 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.250
 hardened, you do not need a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.320
 of the larger water for that link with that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 you have to open the faucet more 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.329
 together with the fact that here is a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.190
 water tank that is low and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 very close to the tap too 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.090
 has less water pressure what makes the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.799
 I want to show here too there serves O 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.070
 the friezes are there every day 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.659
 pass 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.659
 I'm a noise when I turned it on 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.930
 you receive now that you have called the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.409
 as is an event is almost over 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.409
 Last 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.880
 in the course but we should not 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.490
 turns on 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.150
 so now I'm going to give you a very simple tip 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.850
 on here 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.610
 how can you do it of course you 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.790
 can exchange the diaphragm're 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.650
 I do not know why I did not try not to 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.650
 have this repair in this way change 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.670
 Alves, can you do one thing well? 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.550
 simpler 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 I'm going to take the spout out of here 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.890
 here inside is a real drunken 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.610
 I'll remember a little piece of cloth 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 of those perfex type perfex ah tÃ¡ 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:26.890
 I put it in here, put it back 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:31.330
 it 's true that it will do with 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.630
 increase the pressure inside the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.750
 this will press the phadia today 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.830
 Broke faster, I will not need it. 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.550
 so open the faucet that it 's a thing 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.550
 he remarks again 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.060
 already called remember he has a brightness of 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.760
 sun was watching it was there in that brightness 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.880
 that the bryant faucet can now handle 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.940
 is the fight was not connected to the expansion is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.000
 linking well before now the half plus or 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 Anything less you can adjust there. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.200
 put 22 loaves on top of each other 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.810
 this will make you get bigger 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.290
 pressure there only that you have to take care 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.350
 because if you stay too much it can mean 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:33.310
 very early the resistance of the actor 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:33.310
 and in this case we fail a bit more 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.540
 You can see that now you have not even 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.510
 I know if you can see the video is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.540
 after being agreed that now really 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.630
 This water is hot and before 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.560
 he would not go out more awake than she 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.670
 I was in it in the last year I was just going 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.470
 to wash a dish in winter more 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.270
 What I like about this first one is like 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.570
 because the frame is quite warm account 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.610
 now I can lose fat 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.510
 the dishes cutlery and pans a way 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.950
 easier for the simple notes 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.950
 I hope it helps in the process
