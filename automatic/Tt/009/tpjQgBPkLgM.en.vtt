first<00:04:38.360> coming<00:04:38.840> up<00:04:39.190> though<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.220> lot<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.490> good

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
first coming up though a lot of good

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.450

pictures<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.180> came<00:04:41.330> out<00:04:41.539> of<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.720> project

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
pictures that came out of that project

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.540 
pictures that came out of that project
but<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.490> almost<00:04:43.729> feel<00:04:44.180> like<00:04:44.240> you<00:04:44.570> can't<00:04:44.900> miss<00:04:45.550> if

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
but I almost feel like you can't miss if

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.900 
but I almost feel like you can't miss if
you're<00:04:46.789> there<00:04:47.289> when<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.470> Sun<00:04:48.710> comes<00:04:48.950> up<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
you're there when the Sun comes up and

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.880 
you're there when the Sun comes up and
it's<00:04:50.240> cold<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.620> sky<00:04:51.919> is<00:04:51.979> really<00:04:52.430> beautiful

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
it's cold in the sky is really beautiful

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.270 
it's cold in the sky is really beautiful
and<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:56.270> trees<00:04:56.570> are<00:04:56.740> picking<00:04:57.740> up<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.919> light

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
and the trees are picking up the light

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.340 
and the trees are picking up the light
for<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.030> first<00:04:59.270> rays

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
for the first rays

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.180 
for the first rays
it's<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> lovely<00:05:02.010> time<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:07.160> believe<00:05:08.160> that

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
it's a lovely time I believe that

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.850 
it's a lovely time I believe that
environment<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.240> stronger<00:05:09.900> than<00:05:10.200> will<00:05:10.530> I

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
environment is stronger than will I

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.800 
environment is stronger than will I
think<00:05:11.820> being<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.210> south<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.720> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
think being in the south and the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.500 
think being in the south and the
atmosphere<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.680> kind<00:05:13.980> of<00:05:14.070> different<00:05:14.510> the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
atmosphere is kind of different the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.750 
atmosphere is kind of different the
energy<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.140> New<00:05:16.290> York<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.710> real<00:05:16.920> frenetic<00:05:17.580> and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
energy in New York is real frenetic and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.090 
energy in New York is real frenetic and
if<00:05:18.180> you're<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.390> calm<00:05:18.690> person<00:05:19.100> you'll

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
if you're a calm person you'll

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.250 
if you're a calm person you'll
ultimately<00:05:20.310> pick<00:05:21.060> up<00:05:21.240> some<00:05:21.510> of<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.750> frenetic

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
ultimately pick up some of that frenetic

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.130 
ultimately pick up some of that frenetic
pneus<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.950> have<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.550> living<00:05:24.450> here<00:05:24.840> it's
