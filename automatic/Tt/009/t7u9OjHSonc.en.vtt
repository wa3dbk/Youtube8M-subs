00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello friends and welcome here I am already 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:08.310
 in Barcelona on the Samsung Galaxy at a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.540
 pack 2015 the samsung s 6 just finished 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.570
 show at this time so we 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 Now let's see how it works for you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.080
 you have at first hand what it is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 the new samsung galaxy s 6 and the and the s 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.460
 6 edge that now comes from the 2 side 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.880
 left and right very interesting 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.669
 let's see it 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.110
 good friends we have here the galaxy s 6 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.900
 you can see it has a design 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.290
 extremely 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.220
 smart a phone that looks too 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.220
 a thin 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 it has a certain resemblance and I would tell 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 this area 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 for those who have basically yes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.320
 it's a fact 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 so 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.430
 as you can see it has a shiny 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.780
 in front of 5 megapixels 5 megapixels 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.550
 one of the things that I speak has presented 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.620
 now what I feel to see today is about 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.070
 the intuitive part and about the new 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.020
 You have the phone navigation and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.800
 you can even interesting things is 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.800
 what can you assign 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.180
 to contacts by colors you can not do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.740
 that and for example if you have it mouth 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.340
 down can you 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.090
 through the color to fantastic effects 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.090
 Or simply 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.620
 lets go see it 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.910
 another thing that calls us the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 always pay attention to the characters in the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.960
 camera and one of the things that samsung has 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.410
 done is also simplify a bit the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.410
 camera here we take the photo 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.030
 another thing that I like a lot is 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 what they explained to us about the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.890
 different options is as easy as 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.440
 make a small 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.270
 click here and you can predict in the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.270
 panorama option the dog option 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.060
 where you can work and those who 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.680
 They are fans of the cameras as 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.670
 well here you can make your adjustments that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.270
 they usually do basically everything in 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.760
 actually the screen looks amazing in 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.849
 a phone that good 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.299
 it feels very good and here we see the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.299
 camera 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.070
 and me 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.660
 the brother of walter well 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.629
 this one that is here is the charger 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.629
 wireless and good is fine 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:23.240
 d 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.240
 many people 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.840
 although then the side menu is passed 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.840
 so that the finger 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.049
 Y 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 export 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.890
 for right people then the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.040
 children 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.900
 you can not change 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.409
 here it comes out on this side but if you want 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.409
 you can throw 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.099
 so 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.950
