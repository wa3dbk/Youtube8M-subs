this<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.450> again<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.409> reason<00:01:31.560> why<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> run<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this and again the reason why I run the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.910 
this and again the reason why I run the
straightener<00:01:33.299> through<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.630> hair<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.350> once

straightener through my hair first once

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
straightener through my hair first once

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
is because my hair is kind of frizzy and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
is because my hair is kind of frizzy and
it's<00:01:37.439> got<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:37.860> bit<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.280> wave<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> as

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's got a little bit of a wave to it as

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179 
it's got a little bit of a wave to it as
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.409> side<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.799> hair<00:01:41.159> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
if you like so I just kind of tease it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.270 
if you like so I just kind of tease it
slightly<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.680> smooth<00:03:33.159> it<00:03:33.220> down

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
slightly and then smooth it down

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:44.020 
slightly and then smooth it down
afterwards<00:03:33.879> but<00:03:34.180> that's<00:03:34.450> basically<00:03:34.629> it

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.880 

this<00:03:45.030> third<00:03:45.300> hairstyle<00:03:45.840> i<00:03:46.080> absolutely<00:03:46.740> love

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
this third hairstyle i absolutely love

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.410 
this third hairstyle i absolutely love
and<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.280> might<00:03:47.460> take<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> little<00:03:47.850> bit<00:03:47.970> more<00:03:48.180> time

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
and it might take a little bit more time

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.380 
and it might take a little bit more time
but<00:03:48.450> i<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.960> that<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.320> great<00:03:49.710> for<00:03:50.390> fancier

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
but i think that is great for fancier

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.780 
but i think that is great for fancier
events<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.110> basically<00:03:52.920> again<00:03:53.280> working<00:03:53.520> off<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
events so basically again working off of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.060 
events so basically again working off of
that<00:03:54.000> first<00:03:54.270> hairstyle<00:03:54.540> i'm<00:03:55.110> going<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.620> pull

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
that first hairstyle i'm going to pull

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.980 
that first hairstyle i'm going to pull
my<00:03:56.190> hair<00:03:56.370> over<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.730> side<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.210> put<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.750> a

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
my hair over to the side and put it in a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:07.330 
my hair over to the side and put it in a
side<00:03:58.320> ponytail

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.190 

now<00:04:08.340> I'm<00:04:08.550> starting<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.390> take<00:04:09.810> different

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
now I'm starting to take different

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.830 
now I'm starting to take different
sections<00:04:10.710> from<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.070> ponytail<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.840> just

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
sections from that ponytail and just

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.870 
sections from that ponytail and just
pinning<00:04:13.050> them<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.440> in<00:04:13.680> random<00:04:14.160> spots<00:04:14.190> so

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
pinning them up in random spots so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.880 
pinning them up in random spots so
there's<00:04:15.360> not<00:04:15.510> any<00:04:15.690> real<00:04:15.780> technique<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> this

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
there's not any real technique to this

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.620 
there's not any real technique to this
I'm<00:04:17.130> literally<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.609> taking<00:04:18.120> pieces<00:04:18.329> from

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
I'm literally just taking pieces from

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.960 
I'm literally just taking pieces from
the<00:04:18.690> ponytail<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.440> pinning<00:04:20.370> them<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.730> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
the ponytail and pinning them to the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.610 
the ponytail and pinning them to the
side<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.150> my<00:04:21.390> head<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.470> definitely

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
side of my head and this definitely

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.410 
side of my head and this definitely
helps<00:04:23.010> if<00:04:23.280> your<00:04:23.400> hair<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.610> curled<00:04:24.060> first

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
helps if your hair is curled first

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.820 
helps if your hair is curled first
that's<00:04:24.720> why<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.900> worked<00:04:25.170> off<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.620> first

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
that's why I worked off the first

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.040 
that's why I worked off the first
hairstyle<00:04:26.070> because<00:04:26.640> it<00:04:27.420> gives<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.810> bit<00:04:27.960> more

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
hairstyle because it gives a bit more

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.230 
hairstyle because it gives a bit more
texture<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:29.370> looks<00:04:29.490> nicer<00:04:29.940> and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
texture and it just looks nicer and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.960 
texture and it just looks nicer and
smoother<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.170> that's<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> mean<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:32.730> really

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
smoother so that's it I mean it's really

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.400 
smoother so that's it I mean it's really
not<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.270> difficult<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:33.990> out<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.140> all<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
not that difficult but out of all of

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.110 
not that difficult but out of all of
these<00:04:34.590> hairstyles<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.340> probably<00:04:35.790> takes<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
these hairstyles it probably takes the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.790 
these hairstyles it probably takes the
most<00:04:36.240> time<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.840> that's<00:04:37.260> what<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.500> looks<00:04:37.650> like

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
most time and that's what it looks like

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.560 
most time and that's what it looks like
I<00:04:37.980> just<00:04:38.190> think<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.490> very<00:04:38.669> elegant<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.300> you

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570
