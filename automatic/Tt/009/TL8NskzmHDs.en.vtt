00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.050 

hey<00:00:01.350> guys<00:00:01.560> I've<00:00:01.949> got<00:00:02.159> another<00:00:02.340> model<00:00:02.790> here

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey guys I've got another model here

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.410 
hey guys I've got another model here
that<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.480> did<00:00:03.799> about<00:00:04.799> two<00:00:05.520> three<00:00:06.000> months<00:00:06.150> ago

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
that I did about two three months ago

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.100 
that I did about two three months ago
for<00:00:07.230> another<00:00:07.470> one<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.740> my<00:00:07.859> projects<00:00:08.360> this<00:00:09.360> was

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
for another one of my projects this was

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.259 
for another one of my projects this was
before<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.070> cathedral<00:00:11.610> actually<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
before the cathedral actually the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.270 
before the cathedral actually the
Cathedral<00:00:12.960> model<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:13.380> after<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> was

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
Cathedral model was after so this was

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.740 
Cathedral model was after so this was
like<00:00:15.139> more<00:00:16.139> basic<00:00:16.710> version<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.340> could<00:00:17.520> say<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
like more basic version we could say and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.070 
like more basic version we could say and
again<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:20.390> influenced<00:00:21.390> by<00:00:21.449> Gandhari

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
again this was influenced by Gandhari

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
again this was influenced by Gandhari
and<00:00:22.320> architecture<00:00:22.949> using<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
and architecture using you know the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.779 
and architecture using you know the
Romanesque<00:00:24.619> rounded<00:00:25.820> arches<00:00:27.410> which<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:29.220> came

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
Romanesque rounded arches which it came

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640 
Romanesque rounded arches which it came
out<00:00:30.000> okay<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> wasn't<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.779> pleased<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
out okay I wasn't that pleased with it I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.639 
out okay I wasn't that pleased with it I
could<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.309> taken<00:00:32.520> longer<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:34.020> only

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
could have taken longer on this I only

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.299 
could have taken longer on this I only
spent<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> back<00:00:35.809> four<00:00:36.809> hours<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
spent the back four hours or so on it so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.450 
spent the back four hours or so on it so
I<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:39.090> rushed<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.809> at<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> end

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
I really rushed this one at the end

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
I really rushed this one at the end
which<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> learn<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> do

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
which I really need to learn not to do

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.549 
which I really need to learn not to do
for<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> project<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> final<00:00:46.140> product

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
for a project because the final product

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.880 
for a project because the final product
is<00:00:46.739> generally<00:00:47.690> equally<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.750> important<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is generally equally as important as the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
is generally equally as important as the
research<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> method<00:00:51.449> behind

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
research and you know the method behind

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.549 
research and you know the method behind
it<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.140> changed

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it so what I would have changed

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.099 
it so what I would have changed
certainly<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
certainly for this one would be to have

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
certainly for this one would be to have
thicker<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.579> thicker<00:01:02.579> arches<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
thicker you know a thicker arches here

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.140 
thicker you know a thicker arches here
which<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.650> still<00:01:04.890> easily<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.939> add

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
which I can still easily do I just add

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
which I can still easily do I just add
you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.479> an<00:01:06.659> extra<00:01:06.990> section<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.580> it's<00:01:08.580> quite

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you know an extra section on it's quite

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
you know an extra section on it's quite
nice<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> clean<00:01:09.420> inside<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.960> well<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
nice and clean inside as well so you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
nice and clean inside as well so you
could<00:01:10.770> even<00:01:11.060> do<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> inside<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.110> bit

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
could even do up the inside a little bit

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.609 
could even do up the inside a little bit
if<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.340> lift<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.320> probably<00:01:16.320> adding

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
if I really lift it and probably adding

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
if I really lift it and probably adding
some<00:01:16.830> doors<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.430> perhaps<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:18.330> give<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
some doors on perhaps I'll give you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
some doors on perhaps I'll give you
another<00:01:19.560> Lighting's<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.700> right

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
another Lighting's not very good right

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.690 
another Lighting's not very good right
now<00:01:21.090> but

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
now but

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.220 
now but
you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.300> same<00:01:24.330> method<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.050> is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
you know just the same method this is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.490 
you know just the same method this is
all<00:01:25.380> foamboard<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.310> time<00:01:27.050> apart<00:01:28.050> from<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
all foamboard this time apart from the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.360 
all foamboard this time apart from the
pillars<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.800> rounded<00:01:31.800> arches<00:01:32.160> there

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
pillars for the rounded arches there

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.700 
pillars for the rounded arches there
again<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> Gondor<00:01:33.960> design<00:01:34.410> like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
again going for the Gondor design like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.290 
again going for the Gondor design like
my<00:01:35.130> previous<00:01:35.400> houses<00:01:36.530> but<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.100> quite<00:01:38.760> like<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
my previous houses but I quite like the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.770 
my previous houses but I quite like the
kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.900> sloping<00:01:40.350> roof<00:01:40.620> idea<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.780> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
kind of the sloping roof idea here and I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.000 
kind of the sloping roof idea here and I
didn't<00:01:43.080> tile<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.660> do

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
didn't tile it this one which I can do

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.950 
didn't tile it this one which I can do
anytime<00:01:47.010> really<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.730> I'll<00:01:48.270> probably<00:01:48.510> get

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
anytime really so I'll probably get

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
anytime really so I'll probably get
around<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.470> when<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.890> bring<00:01:50.370> it<00:01:50.520> home<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
around to that when I bring it home and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.610 
around to that when I bring it home and
I<00:01:51.150> have<00:01:51.330> more<00:01:52.260> time<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.430> roof<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.620> didn't

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
I have more time the roof here didn't

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.130 
I have more time the roof here didn't
quite<00:01:55.800> work<00:01:55.980> exactly<00:01:56.730> as<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.150> wanted<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.900> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
quite work exactly as I wanted it so I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
quite work exactly as I wanted it so I
think<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:59.070> we'll<00:01:59.190> do<00:01:59.340> I'll<00:01:59.460> actually<00:01:59.640> take

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
think what we'll do I'll actually take

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.000 
think what we'll do I'll actually take
that<00:02:00.210> off<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.050> have<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.290> flat<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.830> and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
that off and then have a flat one and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.760 
that off and then have a flat one and
then<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> rounded<00:02:02.790> top<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.990> lot<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
then have a rounded top like a lot of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
then have a rounded top like a lot of
the<00:02:04.860> minister's<00:02:05.400> buildings<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:07.200> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the minister's buildings have so this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
the minister's buildings have so this
one<00:02:07.770> looks<00:02:07.950> quite<00:02:08.160> Church<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.970> wasn't

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
one looks quite Church like it wasn't

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.260 
one looks quite Church like it wasn't
originally<00:02:09.780> supposed<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.290> be<00:02:10.460> but<00:02:11.460> oh<00:02:11.670> I'll

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
originally supposed to be but oh I'll

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.390 
originally supposed to be but oh I'll

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
show you some of the work behind it I'll

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
show you some of the work behind it I'll
show<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.760> quick<00:02:15.030> scale<00:02:15.900> between<00:02:16.140> two

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
show you a quick scale between two

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.530 
show you a quick scale between two
they're<00:02:17.250> both<00:02:17.490> similar<00:02:18.090> sizes<00:02:18.950> sort<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:21.080> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
they're both similar sizes sort of and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.990 
they're both similar sizes sort of and
they're<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:27.140> there<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.320> go<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> that's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
they're a bit there we go so that's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.660 
they're a bit there we go so that's
that's<00:02:30.330> them<00:02:30.630> together<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.500> certainly<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
that's them together but certainly the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.729 
that's them together but certainly the
this<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.540> one<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.080> did<00:02:34.110> further<00:02:34.560> on

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
this one the one that I did further on

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.949 
this one the one that I did further on
works<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.310> lot<00:02:35.670> better<00:02:35.730> because<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.510> got<00:02:36.660> so

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
works a lot better because it's got so

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.199 
works a lot better because it's got so
much<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.410> depth<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.520> did<00:02:38.700> spend<00:02:39.030> more

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
much more depth and I did spend more

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.110 
much more depth and I did spend more
time<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.550> generally<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.670> went

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
time on it and I generally just went

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.199 
time on it and I generally just went
nuts<00:02:42.360> doing<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.989> one<00:02:43.170> all<00:02:44.040> night<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.970> they

nuts doing that one all night so they

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.270 
nuts doing that one all night so they
look<00:02:45.360> really<00:02:45.660> good<00:02:45.780> together<00:02:46.070> again<00:02:47.070> I'll

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
Design and I've specifically gone in the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.460 
Design and I've specifically gone in the
3d<00:04:06.680> section<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:08.210> so<00:04:08.600> that's<00:04:08.780> why<00:04:08.930> I've<00:04:09.020> so

3d section and so that's why I've so

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.940 
3d section and so that's why I've so
many<00:04:09.620> can<00:04:09.860> 3d<00:04:10.190> outcomes<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.120> models<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.600> cat

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
many can 3d outcomes and models and cat

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.890 
many can 3d outcomes and models and cat
anyway<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.100> was<00:04:13.460> some<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.060> research<00:04:14.480> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
anyway this was some of the research and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.620 
anyway this was some of the research and
designs<00:04:15.860> behind<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.700> was<00:04:16.910> very<00:04:17.209> early<00:04:17.330> on

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
designs behind it this was very early on

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.530 
designs behind it this was very early on
in<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.109> year<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:19.340> at<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.700> start<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:20.030> uni<00:04:20.270> so

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
in the year so at the start of uni so

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.740 
in the year so at the start of uni so
now<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.780> have<00:04:20.989> more<00:04:21.790> substantial<00:04:22.790> project<00:04:23.000> but

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
now I have more substantial project but

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.260 
now I have more substantial project but
I<00:04:23.780> know<00:04:23.930> I'll<00:04:24.140> flick<00:04:24.500> through<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.890> quickly

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
I know I'll flick through this quickly

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.140 
I know I'll flick through this quickly
get<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.450> light<00:04:26.660> on<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:27.020> there<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.970> so<00:04:28.970> that's

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
get the light on up there and so that's

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.970 
get the light on up there and so that's
a<00:04:29.330> few<00:04:29.660> like<00:04:31.180> quick<00:04:32.180> drawings<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.620> went<00:04:33.800> for

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
a few like quick drawings and I went for

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.020 
a few like quick drawings and I went for
some<00:04:34.250> some<00:04:34.820> sort<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.060> typography<00:04:35.600> things<00:04:37.030> like

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
some some sort of typography things like

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.150 
some some sort of typography things like
Cathedral<00:04:38.510> blueprints<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.890> know<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
thinking of having some writing in there

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.610 
thinking of having some writing in there
and<00:04:51.830> never<00:04:51.919> don't<00:04:52.250> know<00:04:52.430> then<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:53.810> goes<00:04:54.320> more

famous back cathedrals some of its quite
empty<00:05:03.320> at<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.800> moment

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.949 

that<00:05:06.909> was<00:05:07.089> the<00:05:07.359> idea<00:05:08.019> and<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:10.449> was<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.779> end

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:10.959 
that was the idea and that was the end

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.999 
that was the idea and that was the end
of<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.469> project<00:05:13.079> then<00:05:14.079> this<00:05:14.319> was<00:05:14.499> for<00:05:14.829> the

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
of that project then this was for the

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.409 
of that project then this was for the
next<00:05:15.789> one<00:05:15.969> this<00:05:16.209> the<00:05:16.749> smaller<00:05:17.409> buildings<00:05:18.389> so<00:05:19.389> I

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
next one this the smaller buildings so I

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.309 
next one this the smaller buildings so I
was<00:05:19.659> looking<00:05:19.809> around<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.649> world<00:05:20.919> generally<00:05:21.819> a

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
was looking around the world generally a

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.469 
was looking around the world generally a
lot<00:05:23.319> of<00:05:23.439> it<00:05:23.589> was<00:05:23.829> heavily<00:05:24.339> kind<00:05:24.759> of<00:05:24.879> cathedral

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
lot of it was heavily kind of cathedral

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.709 
lot of it was heavily kind of cathedral
base<00:05:27.449> France<00:05:28.449> you<00:05:28.869> know<00:05:29.039> doing<00:05:30.039> something<00:05:30.369> of

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
base France you know doing something of

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.529 
base France you know doing something of
1817<00:05:31.719> 13th<00:05:32.289> century<00:05:34.169> ideas<00:05:35.169> looking<00:05:35.589> at<00:05:35.739> that

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
1817 13th century ideas looking at that

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.549 
1817 13th century ideas looking at that
but<00:05:37.539> I<00:05:37.779> always<00:05:38.259> managed<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.069> refer<00:05:39.669> back<00:05:39.699> to

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
but I always managed to refer back to

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.559 
but I always managed to refer back to
cathedrals<00:05:41.559> because<00:05:41.889> I<00:05:41.979> just<00:05:42.159> find<00:05:42.399> them

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
cathedrals because I just find them

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.079 
cathedrals because I just find them
fascinating<00:05:46.649> and<00:05:47.649> yeah<00:05:47.860> here<00:05:48.279> looking<00:05:48.909> at

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
fascinating and yeah here looking at

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.539 
fascinating and yeah here looking at
kind<00:05:49.809> of<00:05:49.929> wooden<00:05:50.319> I<00:05:50.649> think<00:05:51.009> Swedish<00:05:51.639> and

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:53.549 
kind of wooden I think Swedish and

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:56.549 
kind of wooden I think Swedish and
wooden<00:05:54.549> cathedrals<00:05:55.119> that<00:05:55.299> are<00:05:55.449> just<00:05:55.629> like<00:05:55.809> put

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:56.559 
wooden cathedrals that are just like put

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.069 
wooden cathedrals that are just like put
together<00:05:56.709> and<00:05:57.279> then<00:05:57.639> here's<00:05:58.119> more<00:05:58.389> Lord<00:05:58.929> of

00:05:59.069 --> 00:05:59.079 
together and then here's more Lord of

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.519 
together and then here's more Lord of
the<00:05:59.169> Rings

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
the Rings

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.279 
the Rings
okay<00:05:59.979> and<00:06:00.789> he<00:06:00.879> even<00:06:00.969> had<00:06:01.269> Skyrim<00:06:01.839> in<00:06:01.989> here

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
okay and he even had Skyrim in here

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.079 
okay and he even had Skyrim in here
which<00:06:03.159> I<00:06:03.309> felt<00:06:03.969> was<00:06:04.209> very<00:06:04.239> Rohan<00:06:05.759> inspired<00:06:06.759> or

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
which I felt was very Rohan inspired or

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:14.039 
which I felt was very Rohan inspired or
based<00:06:07.359> for<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.349> game<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.909> then<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.509> rest<00:06:13.719> is

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:14.049 
based for the game and then the rest is

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:15.809 
based for the game and then the rest is
I<00:06:14.379> think<00:06:14.439> the<00:06:14.679> rice<00:06:14.829> is<00:06:15.009> empty<00:06:15.339> but<00:06:15.459> that<00:06:15.639> was

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
I think the rice is empty but that was

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:21.569 
I think the rice is empty but that was
the<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:19.389> sketchbook<00:06:20.079> for<00:06:20.589> those<00:06:20.889> those<00:06:21.549> two

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:21.579 
the the sketchbook for those those two

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:25.859 
the the sketchbook for those those two
projects<00:06:24.029> that<00:06:25.029> came<00:06:25.179> out<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.509> came<00:06:25.719> right

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:25.869

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.269 
projects that came out I came right
quite<00:06:26.110> nicely<00:06:26.349> and<00:06:26.619> then<00:06:26.829> you<00:06:26.979> know<00:06:27.129> you've
