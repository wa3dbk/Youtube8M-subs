00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.450
 and 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello also alex from chapter.com and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.700
 today I will bring back the news 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.110
 cultures texture gum skin iphone 5 which 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.270
 are available under marquee points 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.470
 as of course the link and the Arctic 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.990
 in the description of the video 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.730
 so we have ten different colors then 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.669
 they are all so I wanted to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.680
 show 1.1 to 1.9 on my iphone 5 64 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 geek blah no I have no iphone 5 black 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.110
 to do this test did we saw 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.820
 with a block simply 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 so if we look at how the actor who 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 had just done this one this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 month colors we see how the holidays 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.780
 we have access to all our doc notes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.480
 in wood with our jack and speaker 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 the microphone has full access also for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.280
 the volume buttons as well from 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
 vibration and bone for the handsome power 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 quite simply 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.500
 in the back we have full access too 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 for the camera as well as the flash so 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.729
 poor shit it's very simple we take 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.340
 our case like these and I I you 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.430
 strongly advise to drop this side 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.149
 there and afterwards just dropped that one 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.950
 thereafter 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.890
 so it's very simple we see it there 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.260
 and that's it's done if we look at them 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.930
 results and well you have your heart 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.640
 of the game tonight that finger marks 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 the fact that you see how he 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 then works so like this so that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 it's the black color done afterwards 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 we do remove we have removed as I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
 say it's important to draw there 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 on it then just for the ap like 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 these as they say on the internet 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 then will install the second then the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.600
 same principle will just try to put them 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.200
 closer to me to have a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.960
 better handling of the latter and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 so this is once they pose and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.720
 we see it's a hat post on 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.820
 has our heart here that's the blue 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.470
 no, we started with death 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.030
 threat and the blue can not 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.759
 to confuse with the blue which is a lot 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.340
 darker to the complete annexed here as 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.470
 this you see as access then the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.120
 lip in the same way no when the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.380
 spring top left we know above 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.470
 now the dark blue color then 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.050
 is posing like this and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 this is the result 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.600
 so that's the clubs do it it's 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.640
 for your iphone 5 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.800
 so there are also pictures of each 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.020
 color his driver to the point as if 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.210
 you want to see it in more detail what 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.300
 day that the news anyway 720p so 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.150
 this film well next color the pink 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.040
 very careful about the picture on this 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.020
 chapter to the point as it looks like 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.760
 it's closer to red but 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.100
 in video you see well this hero this 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.500
 does that of course the whites do 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.720
 get the red out of the pink color but 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.490
 you see that it Minquiers 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.640
 pink colors then are in candy pink 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.190
 which I showed all called then that 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.290
 it was the color pink simply pretended 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.660
 I take it off and she with the rose 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 candy mines no nathalie pink candy and 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:17.200
 this is the sweet pink 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.470
 then you see this flash rose that's it 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.570
 pink sweet the next colors the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.820
 red 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.180
 the red army that here like this I 'm going 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.740
 become a professional to follow suit 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.140
 hulls are iphone 5 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.300
 you see on the red color it 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.130
 lacks four colors including the blin which 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.440
 can consider as a color in 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.140
 my hand now for the video I'm going 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.420
 consider as a color then 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.310
 now the whites so we'll be 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.260
 that if like this same principle of 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.850
 white color 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.790
 then he is now too much color on 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.940
 yellow the green and the turn it was seen with 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.700
 the yellow so I always ask myself 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.300
 Similarly tonight a grind 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.050
 daily 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.040
 and here we do not note yellow color as 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:24.940
 these are left two colors green 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:31.360
 and the purple she with the valley 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:38.950
 and here are the greens and now the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:42.880
 purple and no the less we install and we 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.890
 you see it three convoys that have 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.020
 still good textures me I 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.730
 you say it's the touch it's really 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.050
 as the eraser is easy it's not 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.740
 the gum that everything works like a 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.300
 chewing gum 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.880
 it's really like a texture of 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.970
 serious eraser is nice 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.120
 it's really satisfied massaly in 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.100
 but it does not mean anything to say 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.190
 beautiful cases for iphone 5 all 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.560
