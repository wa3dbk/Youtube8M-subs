00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
then the rest of the gear kinda looks

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
then the rest of the gear kinda looks
like<00:01:20.880> gear<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.360> seen<00:01:21.630> before<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.950> them<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
like gear we seen before to them to the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
like gear we seen before to them to the
red<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.030> red<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.479> has<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
red one so the red one has a lot of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
red one so the red one has a lot of
purple<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.790> purple<00:01:27.119> eyes<00:01:27.240> light<00:01:27.600> up

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
