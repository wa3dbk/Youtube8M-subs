00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.440
 these villages and towns continue to grow, more and more demanded 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.790
 clean and affordable water supply 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.089
 we not only have an efficient pipeline network for the supply of 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.339
 need clean water 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.270
 but also to collect the waste the sewage water both to 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.300
 drinking water as the sewage system 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 the work of ptc is ideal 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.070
 politicians or polyvinyl chloride 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.530
 is an art or made of 57 percent is his alter and only 43 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.350
 percent grew 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.640
 one must also add interactive so it was stabilizers the raw materials 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.970
 and to get frequent and in order that I possess properties 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.610
 sad he finds a trial taking place 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.480
 but after the raw material pastis be decorated with the help of explosives such as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.670
 you can see with this laboratory equipment 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.400
 the working temperature is around 180 degrees Celsius, what kind of this 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 processes and the relatively low temperature 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.800
 the extreme pressed the melted art or by the madrid who made the final 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.900
 shape size determined 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.460
 the extruded measurements 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.940
 cooled by the water 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.940
 and then form a promotional product 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.840
 the industrial processes are that the council is fully automated 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.610
 service arrangements you can resist the formation of at least 30 percent 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.579
 but Sensi Cynischer is also in favor 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.030
 the different materials that can be found in 300 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.909
 This is everyone are usually a bundle or even arranged and are six 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:36.650
 meters long 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.250
 but they can still be arranged different lengths 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.070
 during transport and storage or a top training deployed to ensure 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 that the loan is not getting polluted 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.770
 For privacy reasons they can take up to 15 days 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.620
 if it consists of several layers 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.610
 usually a three day trip 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 nb the inner layer of team usa i made on tv series 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.040
 this means 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.609
 that the loan is easier and more environmentally friendly 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.609
 builds the Belgian top gear high quality 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.049
 we invest in the 7 series the photo traffic and transport 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.599
 in many cases interested people can be heyningen 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.929
 be handled manually 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.359
 Another is also benefits of privacy reasons that is a very 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.309
 densely populated 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.469
 first you can saw the tube with another or machine in the right way too 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.029
 to make 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.639
 for privacy reasons to assemble are fourth accessories and connectors 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.519
 comparable 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.469
 but it is also the materials used on most other indios system 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.619
 are being connected 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.559
 no special tools are needed for this and in just a few minutes 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.429
 batter 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.889
 8 you can imagine 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.129
 that it is handy when you have to work in the land that is full of loans 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.689
 Thanks to Jansen's strength are eg sidelinge 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.469
 single resistant to formation 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.560
 but by leakage at the connecting pieces it is prevented 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.549
 begins to soak in a coma if the members are underground 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.680
 so that the water keeps flowing even my work flow 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.749
 8 the members must be carefully installed in accordance with the applicable 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.749
 instructions optimize their function 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.649
 no doubt defensively the right material is unreliable and economical dion 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:31.759
 systems build recent surveys it confirms that eg ciree the systems 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.179
 can be used for at least a hundred years 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.179
 and low maintenance costs 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.119
 but that is not yet 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.989
 the intensive stuff can be erased and then comes to the matter 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 I can not only remain on a premier league stand after installation 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.619
 but also good in the maternity ward are collected and recycled 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.269
 if reasons are collected in ashes, the wastewater is collected by that other paving company 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.110
 brought 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.599
 as you can see here 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.529
 if desired, the material can even be sorted by color 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.529
 before it is ground into small pieces 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.239
 At low cost and the parole you can't limit it is most critics 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.639
 originating from construction and construction work 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.189
 and sometimes the parcel is collected elsewhere and formerly 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.789
 nevertheless, the plans still have to be limited as always 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.569
 glass 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.189
 that does or does not remove this in plastic 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.659
 before the material text can no longer be as we have before 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.159
 seen 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:31.509
 when the van male pieces are reunited in vinegar, they become themselves in the film 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.909
 it is down and a fine of only a few hundred meters long 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.639
 the powder is then ready to work on store sold here that can unload the 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.639
 will make products from then why not agree 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.210
 For privacy reasons they really are the best choice for a sustainable water management system 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.379
 think of the small amount of oil and raw materials 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.669
 and the xtreamer long service life of 100 years 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.700
 bye the ease with which tv series to be used 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.970
 it is easy to understand 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.630
 if the weight is compared the so-called traditional materials with 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.520
 an equal diameter the traffic is those rescues 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 and are up to fourteen times lighter 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.419
 A similar comparison yields a benefit of 45 percent for later 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.069
 politicians seeing things 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.270
 we can therefore rightly say that things like ciree things can really be the best 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.520
 certainly now and in the future for measuring sustainable drinking water 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.879
 and sewerage network m
