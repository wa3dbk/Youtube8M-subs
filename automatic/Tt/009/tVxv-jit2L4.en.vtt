00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
probably knows the game better than you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
probably knows the game better than you
he<00:00:55.559> probably<00:00:55.710> has<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.280> game<00:00:56.579> sense<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
better aim and to beat him you probably

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.240 
better aim and to beat him you probably
need<00:00:59.910> teamwork<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.440> can't<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:01.980> do

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

need teamwork and you can't really do
teamwork<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.390> absolutely<00:01:03.600> no

to<00:01:52.020> figure<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.430> once

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to figure all of that out and once

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
to figure all of that out and once
you've<00:01:54.060> done<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.509> research<00:01:54.540> once<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.439> have

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you've done your research once you have

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.630 
you've done your research once you have
the<00:01:55.829> information<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.600> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.719> figure<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the information you want to figure out a

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
the information you want to figure out a
strategy<00:01:59.640> how<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.450> beat<00:02:00.780> him<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.229> don't

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
strategy how to beat him you don't

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.940 
strategy how to beat him you don't
really<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> face<00:02:02.790> him<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.329> 1v1

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
really want to face him in 1v1

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.870 
really want to face him in 1v1
situations<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> don't<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> go

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
situations you don't really want to go

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
situations you don't really want to go
into<00:02:06.060> 1v1<00:02:06.659> gunfights<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.890> example<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.280> he

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
into 1v1 gunfights for example if he

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
into 1v1 gunfights for example if he
plays<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.000> bomb<00:02:09.239> site<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.629> want<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> try<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
plays on a bomb site you want to try to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.170 
plays on a bomb site you want to try to
take<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.530> B<00:02:10.709> bomb<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.220> try<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> isolate<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
take the B bomb so I try to isolate the

Smurfs

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.950 
Smurfs
and<00:02:12.950> make<00:02:13.250> him<00:02:13.520> play<00:02:13.760> retake<00:02:14.360> because<00:02:14.780> that

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and make him play retake because that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.530 
and make him play retake because that
way<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.410> retake<00:02:15.770> scenarios<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.640> will<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.210> lot

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
way in retake scenarios it will be a lot

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.310 
way in retake scenarios it will be a lot
harder<00:02:17.930> for<00:02:18.200> him<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:19.240> actually<00:02:20.240> get<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.080> wind

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
harder for him to actually get the wind

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.410 
harder for him to actually get the wind
to<00:02:21.560> actually<00:02:21.860> win<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> round<00:02:22.400> but<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.330> you

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
to actually win the round but what you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.150 
to actually win the round but what you
need<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.660> look<00:02:23.780> out<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.740> Smurfs

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
need to look out for is that Smurfs

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.550 
need to look out for is that Smurfs
might<00:02:25.490> change<00:02:25.730> his<00:02:25.970> position<00:02:26.600> because<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
might change his position because if you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410 
might change his position because if you
get<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.830> few<00:02:28.010> rounds<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.520> b-bomb<00:02:28.970> side<00:02:29.240> he

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
get a few rounds on the b-bomb side he

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.080 
get a few rounds on the b-bomb side he
might<00:02:29.570> as<00:02:29.690> well<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:29.870> go<00:02:30.140> B<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.820> tell<00:02:31.820> someone

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
might as well just go B and tell someone

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.210 
might as well just go B and tell someone
else<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.480> go<00:02:32.660> away<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.440> because<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:33.980> you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
else to go away so because of that you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.950 
else to go away so because of that you
actually<00:02:34.340> need<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> develop<00:02:35.090> strategies<00:02:35.780> you

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
actually need to develop strategies you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.410 
actually need to develop strategies you
actually<00:02:36.230> need<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.770> some<00:02:37.340> basic<00:02:37.640> strategy

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
actually need to do some basic strategy

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
actually need to do some basic strategy
you<00:02:38.720> don't<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.320> want<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you don't really just want to go and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.160 
you don't really just want to go and
wash<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> rush<00:02:41.180> B<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.600> want<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.840> execute

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
wash a you rush B you want to execute

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.680 
wash a you rush B you want to execute
some<00:02:42.350> simple<00:02:42.770> strategies<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.970> example<00:02:44.030> maybe

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
some simple strategies for example maybe

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.660 
some simple strategies for example maybe
do<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.990> B<00:02:45.350> split<00:02:45.650> which<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.070> probably<00:02:46.400> not<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
do a B split which is probably not the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.350 
do a B split which is probably not the
most<00:02:46.730> effective<00:02:47.360> thing<00:02:47.600> ever<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:50.120> might

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
most effective thing ever but it might

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.760 
most effective thing ever but it might
be<00:02:50.510> something<00:02:50.540> different<00:02:51.080> from<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.739> usual

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
be something different from your usual

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.960 
be something different from your usual
rush<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.700> or<00:02:52.910> rush<00:02:53.090> B<00:02:53.300> or<00:02:53.450> go<00:02:53.630> for<00:02:53.870> picks<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
rush a or rush B or go for picks and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.850 
rush a or rush B or go for picks and
maybe<00:02:55.970> try<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.870> some<00:02:57.080> work<00:02:57.350> with<00:02:57.380> smoke

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
maybe try to do some work with smoke

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.890 
maybe try to do some work with smoke
strollers<00:02:58.310> throw<00:02:58.670> smokes<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.180> benefit<00:02:59.660> you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
strollers throw smokes that benefit you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.860 
strollers throw smokes that benefit you
and<00:03:00.140> go<00:03:00.950> for<00:03:01.190> these<00:03:01.310> creative<00:03:01.910> strategies

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and go for these creative strategies

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.900 
and go for these creative strategies
usually<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.830> team<00:03:04.130> will<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.580> an<00:03:04.760> in-game

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
usually a team will have an in-game

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.150 
usually a team will have an in-game
leader<00:03:05.270> who<00:03:05.570> call<00:03:05.810> strats<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.890> found

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
leader who call strats and I found

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280 
leader who call strats and I found
myself<00:03:07.340> even<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.150> soloqueue<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.870> there<00:03:09.080> is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
myself even in soloqueue that there is

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.520 
myself even in soloqueue that there is
usually<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.860> person<00:03:10.400> who<00:03:11.060> knows<00:03:11.390> basic<00:03:12.230> stress

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
usually a person who knows basic stress

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.740 
usually a person who knows basic stress
I'm<00:03:13.160> usually<00:03:13.459> not<00:03:13.760> playing<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.209> role<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.420> an

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
I'm usually not playing the role of an

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.960 
I'm usually not playing the role of an
in-game<00:03:15.020> leader<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:16.100> when<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:16.550> playing<00:03:16.580> with

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
in-game leader but when I'm playing with

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.210 
in-game leader but when I'm playing with
pre<00:03:17.209> mates<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.930> was<00:03:18.049> usually<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.410> person<00:03:18.890> who

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
pre mates there was usually a person who

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.400 
pre mates there was usually a person who
plays<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.209> there's<00:03:20.510> usually<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.930> person<00:03:21.140> who

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
plays it there's usually a person who

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.949 
plays it there's usually a person who
call<00:03:21.680> strats<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.370> whenever<00:03:23.000> I'm<00:03:23.269> solo<00:03:23.540> cueing

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
call strats and whenever I'm solo cueing

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.199 
call strats and whenever I'm solo cueing
most<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.830> time<00:03:25.040> there<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.220> also<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.670> person

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
most of the time there is also a person

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.199 
most of the time there is also a person
who<00:03:26.440> communicates<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.650> call<00:03:27.920> strats<00:03:28.400> so

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
who communicates and call strats so

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.330 
who communicates and call strats so
maybe<00:03:30.049> he<00:03:30.290> will<00:03:30.380> figure<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.860> out<00:03:31.010> for<00:03:31.190> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
maybe he will figure that out for you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.250 
maybe he will figure that out for you
but<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:31.700> he<00:03:31.820> doesn't<00:03:32.060> try<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.840> do<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.140> at<00:03:33.230> your

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
but if he doesn't try to do it at your

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.100 
but if he doesn't try to do it at your
own<00:03:33.560> try<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.950> think<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.120> creative<00:03:35.570> strategies

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
own try to think of creative strategies

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.820 
own try to think of creative strategies
on<00:03:36.380> how<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:37.040> actually<00:03:37.459> be<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.820> Smurf<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.590> not

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
on how to actually be the Smurf it's not

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.770 
on how to actually be the Smurf it's not
easy<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.730> said<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.269> doesn't<00:03:41.600> guarantee

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
easy and as I said it doesn't guarantee

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.460 
easy and as I said it doesn't guarantee
you<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> win<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.790> guarantees<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.900> chance

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you a win but it guarantees you a chance

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.530 
you a win but it guarantees you a chance
of<00:03:45.769> winning<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.340> because<00:03:47.209> I've<00:03:47.390> actually

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
of winning and because I've actually

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.810 
of winning and because I've actually
played<00:03:48.110> against<00:03:48.440> Smurfs<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.950> lot<00:03:49.340> like<00:03:49.610> my

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
played against Smurfs a lot like my

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.880 
played against Smurfs a lot like my
every<00:03:50.269> other<00:03:50.450> game<00:03:50.810> has<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:51.110> smurf<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.739> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
every other game has a smurf in the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.620 
every other game has a smurf in the
enemy<00:03:52.130> team<00:03:52.370> which<00:03:53.090> is<00:03:53.180> pretty<00:03:53.360> annoying

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
enemy team which is pretty annoying

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.240 
enemy team which is pretty annoying
though<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.650> I've<00:03:54.799> played<00:03:54.980> against

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
though but because I've played against

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.180

Smurfs<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.730> lot<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.269> beat<00:03:57.049> them<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.470> lot<00:03:57.739> as<00:03:57.950> well

player and they are not unbeatable and
it<00:04:09.500> does<00:04:09.680> feel<00:04:09.920> very<00:04:09.950> satisfying<00:04:10.730> when<00:04:11.000> you

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
it does feel very satisfying when you

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.479 
it does feel very satisfying when you
actually<00:04:11.209> kill<00:04:11.630> them<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.769> even<00:04:13.100> won<00:04:13.340> a

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
to have the confidence and if you don't

have the confidence you won't have a

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.070 
have the confidence you won't have a
chance<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.380> beating<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.010> Smurfs<00:04:57.630> but<00:04:58.630> then

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
chance of beating the Smurfs but then

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.600 
chance of beating the Smurfs but then
again<00:04:59.169> if<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.590> have<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.860> confidence<00:05:00.190> and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
again if you have the confidence and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.670 
again if you have the confidence and
you'll<00:05:00.789> lose<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.210> gunfights<00:05:01.600> all<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.320> time

you'll lose the gunfights all the time

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.960 
you'll lose the gunfights all the time
it<00:05:03.010> will<00:05:03.460> feel<00:05:03.760> horrible<00:05:04.500> but<00:05:05.500> it's<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.310> only

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
it will feel horrible but it's the only

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.260 
it will feel horrible but it's the only
way<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:08.080> actually<00:05:08.470> beat<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:09.039> smurf<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.970> all

way to actually beat a smurf like all

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.060 
way to actually beat a smurf like all
this<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.780> just<00:05:10.960> some<00:05:11.110> pretty<00:05:11.289> fucking<00:05:11.740> random

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
this is just some pretty fucking random

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.969 
this is just some pretty fucking random
rambling<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.360> all<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:13.780> shit<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.560> do<00:05:14.650> want

rambling and all that shit but I do want
to<00:05:15.039> say<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.610> if<00:05:16.479> there's<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.289> huge<00:05:18.039> difference

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
to say that if there's a huge difference

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.900

the chances of beating him will probably
be<00:05:24.130> very<00:05:24.610> low<00:05:24.910> like<00:05:25.300> if<00:05:25.780> you're<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.139> silver<00:05:26.560> like

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.580 
be very low like if you're a silver like
a<00:05:27.070> silver<00:05:27.550> three<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.320> you're<00:05:29.320> playing

against a legendary eagle you probably

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.159 
against a legendary eagle you probably
won't<00:05:33.039> beat<00:05:33.460> him<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:34.360> if<00:05:34.510> you're<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.750> master
