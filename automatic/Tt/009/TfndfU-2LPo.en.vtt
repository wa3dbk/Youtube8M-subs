00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 an event that he does every so often 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.600
 in which you can put the jewels together 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.340
 old ones that you no longer use and you use them 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.500
 of credit to buy new things 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.680
 there's the expert hello is cristian 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.450
 how is it 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.709
 it's good that we agreed and that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.190
 tells me that I proposed to come here and from 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.569
 see I do not know much of a good opportunity 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.569
 to get to know a little 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 ah 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.629
 you know how 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.260
 the neighborhoods that says it makes a 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.159
 difference 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.159
 the whole life 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.640
 who is buying a restoration 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.640
 that accompanies life 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 area 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.930
 my chances images 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.970
 here 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.740
 something that you have to see in this 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.970
 entire collection does not decide animals and 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.340
 his drawings were always very look at that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.030
 It is the starting point 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.030
 of the medieval social collection 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.030
 as 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.400
 of plundering the world 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.400
 we have to look at the light 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.979
 yes the transverse shape 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.800
 I like it 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.830
 if you do not create trends 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:46.140
 the stories can not be the sea 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.680
 or an architect someone like tÃ pies 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.680
 is filming
