in the Facebook post is really
interesting<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.269> imaginal<00:00:16.139> cell<00:00:16.440> do

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
interesting it's the imaginal cell do

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.689 
interesting it's the imaginal cell do
you<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> way<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> little

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
you like the way I have a little

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880 
you like the way I have a little
whiteboard<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.109> imaginal

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
whiteboard here for this the imaginal

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
whiteboard here for this the imaginal
cell<00:00:20.359> wildest<00:00:21.359> idea<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
cell wildest idea you know the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.519 
cell wildest idea you know the
illustration<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> metaphor<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
illustration of the metaphor of the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
illustration of the metaphor of the
butterfly<00:00:25.529> coming<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> caterpillar

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
butterfly coming out of the caterpillar

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
butterfly coming out of the caterpillar
has<00:00:27.570> been<00:00:28.320> used<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.740> years<00:00:28.859> by

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
has been used for years by

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.510 
has been used for years by
transformational<00:00:29.910> individuals<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
transformational individuals and as you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.459 
transformational individuals and as you
know<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> great<00:00:33.210> illustration<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.989> what

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
know it's a great illustration but what

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.830 
know it's a great illustration but what
I<00:00:34.500> never<00:00:34.649> understood<00:00:35.070> fully<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.690> what

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
I never understood fully is that what

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.990 
I never understood fully is that what
enables<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> butterfly<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> emerge<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
enables the butterfly to emerge out of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.770 
enables the butterfly to emerge out of
the<00:00:39.149> caterpillar

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the caterpillar

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.580 
the caterpillar
is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.649> fact<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> chrysalis<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.879> hard<00:00:42.590> kind

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
is the fact that a chrysalis a hard kind

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
is the fact that a chrysalis a hard kind
of<00:00:43.770> shell<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.430> formed<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
of shell is formed it looks like this

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.930 
of shell is formed it looks like this
see<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.730> hard<00:00:48.000> cell<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.870> formed

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
see that it's a hard cell is formed

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
see that it's a hard cell is formed
shell<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> formed<00:00:51.420> around<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
shell is formed around the the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610 
shell is formed around the the
dissolving<00:00:53.670> old<00:00:53.969> structure<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
dissolving old structure so you have a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
dissolving old structure so you have a
structure<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.390> wrapping<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
structure that is wrapping up the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
structure that is wrapping up the
process<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> transformation<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
process of transformation and the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
process of transformation and the
caterpillar<00:01:00.809> becomes<00:01:01.109> goo<00:01:01.440> absolutely

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
caterpillar becomes goo absolutely

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
caterpillar becomes goo absolutely
dissolves<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> familiar<00:01:03.809> into

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
dissolves from the familiar into

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
dissolves from the familiar into
something<00:01:04.890> completely<00:01:05.040> different<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
something completely different and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
something completely different and
that's<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.510> transition<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's what transition really is it's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
that's what transition really is it's
the<00:01:07.920> ending<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.610> era<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> beginning<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the ending of an era in the beginning of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.429 
the ending of an era in the beginning of
a<00:01:09.600> new<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> goo<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.689> cells<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a new one and in the goo the cells that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.960 
a new one and in the goo the cells that
are<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.250> part<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> new

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
are in there that are part of the new

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
are in there that are part of the new
creation<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:16.350> locked<00:01:16.680> within<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
creation have locked within them by the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
creation have locked within them by the
design<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.880> God<00:01:17.909> an<00:01:18.299> image<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.619> are

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
design of God an image and they are

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
design of God an image and they are
called<00:01:19.950> imaginal<00:01:20.549> cells<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.360> carry

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
called imaginal cells because they carry

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
called imaginal cells because they carry
within<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> image<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.979> new<00:01:23.310> species

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
within them the image of a new species

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
within them the image of a new species
and<00:01:24.540> although<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and although they have to do is kind of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
and although they have to do is kind of
vibrate<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> community<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.439> these

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
vibrate in in the community of these

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
vibrate in in the community of these
cells<00:01:28.920> until<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.430> find<00:01:29.850> each<00:01:30.060> other<00:01:30.329> and

image that they've got on the inside
it's<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:39.990> sharing<00:01:40.500> the
