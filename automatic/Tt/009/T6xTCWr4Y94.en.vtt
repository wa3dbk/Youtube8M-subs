00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.300 
uses recycled HP inkjet so it's good for
the<00:02:04.060> environment<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.890> good<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.070> go

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
the environment and it's just good to go

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.730 
the environment and it's just good to go
overall<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.609> think<00:02:06.880> it's<00:02:07.420> very<00:02:07.600> good<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.500> runs

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
overall I think it's very good it runs

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.040 
overall I think it's very good it runs
on<00:02:08.860> USB<00:02:09.340> power<00:02:09.610> not<00:02:10.060> really<00:02:10.390> much<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.840> like

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
on USB power not really much of like

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.840 
on USB power not really much of like
real<00:02:11.470> power<00:02:11.710> so<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.250> pretty<00:02:12.400> energy

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
real power so it's pretty energy

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.640 
real power so it's pretty energy
efficient<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.110> I'm<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.350> print<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
efficient so I'm going to print the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.740 
efficient so I'm going to print the
picture<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.520> New<00:02:15.580> Jersey<00:02:15.760> Devils<00:02:16.000> logo<00:02:16.510> on

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
picture of the New Jersey Devils logo on

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.470 
picture of the New Jersey Devils logo on
the<00:02:16.870> printer<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.530> does<00:02:17.980> 32<00:02:18.910> pages<00:02:19.269> per<00:02:19.390> minute

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the printer it does 32 pages per minute

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.199 
the printer it does 32 pages per minute
black<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.110> 24<00:02:20.560> pages<00:02:21.430> per<00:02:21.700> minute<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:21.970> color

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
black and 24 pages per minute in color

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.520 
black and 24 pages per minute in color
so<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
so you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.330 
so you
and<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.110> hit<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> print<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and I just hit the print so it's

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.460 
and I just hit the print so it's
processing<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.600> should<00:02:28.810> print<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.260> about

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
processing and it should print in about

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.790 
processing and it should print in about
a<00:02:29.500> second

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
a second

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.040 
a second
90<00:02:32.800> second<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.280> warming<00:02:33.550> up<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.840> goes

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
90 second it's warming up and there goes

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.230 
90 second it's warming up and there goes
