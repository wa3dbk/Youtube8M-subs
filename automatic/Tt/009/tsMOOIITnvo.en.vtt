00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 be 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.939
 Hello dear friends with you andrew 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.310
 we continue to do fashion reviews and 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.730
 Today we will see a mod which 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.289
 adds maincraft and large to the game 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.720
 the number of new golems is not such 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.650
 small corners let by type 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 towncraft 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.250
 and the biggest of all 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.230
 four blocks will and that to us 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.860
 activate all this fraternity us 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.690
 need to craft a sweater like this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.120
 this scroll looks crafted it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.880
 as follows and to activate 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 any golem we need to approach it and 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.660
 right click on his head 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.200
 and we get a variety of halimov here 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.450
 Here such here and what gradation goes at 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.030
 given golem 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.200
 this is what I get back from what material 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.060
 made a golem so he better let's say 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.350
 land golem he will lose mud 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.070
 in the battle perfectly you damn diamond golem 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.939
 he is also on 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.670
 and gold loses also in hp and in 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.710
 Damage is graduation up that is what 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.640
 the material is worse the less damage them and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.149
 patch material is better than the damage above their 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.859
 naturally more 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.520
 also when killing data kalimov us 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.560
 falls out 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.229
 some items of what they are made of 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.859
 here let's say we fell three three blocks 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.030
 land 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:49.090
 now if we kill the covers of emerald 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.670
 Bole Anton oh no there the hell in general us 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.579
 there were a few 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.109
 emerald of and this principle is not all 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.159
 let's go now let's see 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.579
 what else more we have fun 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.329
 such 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.240
 and keep looking at our golems 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.410
 Next go on the sand golem but 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.940
 vision written 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.040
 from sandstone obsidian golem or 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.850
 Golem, I basically do not know how to 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.330
 Golem Gali 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 everywhere different ice golem chase him 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.640
 how to say ice ice in general ice 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.070
 golem and neither is it more true I am something 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.140
 confused in my is neither brika of 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.570
 hell bricks if i'm not mistaken 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.860
 right, well, let's come, let's come, let's come. 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:44.710
 ka golem activate bad 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.710
 Hell of a brick well, in general, did not grow together with 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.580
 this golem and the last sorrow that we 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.950
 can activate 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.950
 this is a glass golem like this 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.680
 It looks transparent all such 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.950
 interesting and you may have appeared 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.010
 the question is how I put the pumpkin on the glass well 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.230
 maybe I didnâ€™t show up 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.250
 I make the basis for the golem and want to put 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.810
 top pumpkin but it is not put to us 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.530
 need to take any block let's say 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.870
 block of land 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.520
 break this bolt put here from above 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.090
 pumpkin remove this block put the block 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.790
 lands and we can now activate 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.190
 glass golem again I repeat 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.800
 guys all have a gradation that is from 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.360
 smaller for the better also some could 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.300
 some golem and now reacts to 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.340
 mobs let's say on spiders 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.210
 the skeleton was me here let's go 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.940
 sleep a few spiders now 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.620
 almost all golem and they start 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.670
 kick here look and skillz also with 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.670
 skeletons earlier as you know the golem we 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.550
 don't kill skeletons and spiders let's 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.940
 Now we will try to spawn someone 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.860
 slugs and zombies and on this we complete the slugs 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.740
 don't kill most likely they look what 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.850
 and slugs month such here and so 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.850
 let's zombies 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.760
 they also kill zombies like this 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.970
 it didn't sound strange 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.060
 and on this i have all subscribe to 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.570
