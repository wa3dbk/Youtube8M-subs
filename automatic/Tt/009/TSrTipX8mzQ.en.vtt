00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.970
 from the liver and uninterrupted power 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.450
 important function of uninterrupted source 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 power is fast and correct and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.139
 switching stylish battery and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 back and important as speed 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.730
 switching so absence from the base 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 jump providing these parameters 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 quality sources of uninterrupted 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 power algorithms are digital 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.380
 signal processing such as fander 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.080
 auto- tuning wheel frequency and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 simplest source filtering 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 uninterruptible power supply 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.469
 these algorithms are implemented therefore 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
 switching occurs with jumps phase 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.550
 also detecting the disappearance 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 networks by a simplified algorithm of such 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.170
 sources and their habitat cite 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.649
 high switching delays 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 work interval 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.660
 connected equipment 1 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.420
 quality network and assess the significance of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 above parameters 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.399
 this experience apply the load as 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 induction motor 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.239
 such engines are widespread 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.280
 equipment can be said that this is the most 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.379
 Cheap motor type for home network 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 220 volt 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 specifically this engine is original hands 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.320
 designed for three-phase network and to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.070
 ensure its operation in a single-phase network 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 used by reaching capacitor 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.710
 with a capacity of 120 microfarad the engine has 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.869
 power and a half kilowatt to from to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.659
 starting power limit for household 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.180
 single phase network so kiev sponge 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.600
 voltage drops and a lamp occur 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 diminishes 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 so once more 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.650
 the pack is attenuated it is important that this type 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.390
 motor phase is sensitive ie it 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.210
 torque is phase dependent 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.299
 applied voltage is therefore sharp 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.310
 phase change handing stress 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.950
 cause a big ripple of moment that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.540
 manifested as mechanical shocks 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.280
 destructive engine design with 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
 we model a nervous situation with the help 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.910
 short engine start 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.500
 compartment 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 This situation arises you 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.000
 matching of the fas of the mains and phase 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.340
 prick rotor and drive in on slip 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.340
 fields we will make this experience 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.340
 turn off briefly 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.680
 a significant shock occurs in the engine 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.120
 because of which the engine bounces 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.250
 now let 's do the switching experience 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:08.560
 on network uninterruptible power supply 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:12.600
 debt sp12 5000 connect the engine so 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.600
 first turn on the source 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.790
 and also 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.790
 and every second 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 and for some 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.180
 wherein 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.989
 treatment 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.780
 they happen i go there 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.780
 still give birth 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.360
 you lazy it changes 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.689
 allowed to wear 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.110
 he created connect the first 200 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.699
 something me this in order to 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.699
 man fee and then before 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.690
 everyone works 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.690
 here 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.700
 prices then 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.700
 she algorithm . 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.939
 allows you to work correctly such 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.939
 get buttons 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.550
 let's mechanical blows and destruction
