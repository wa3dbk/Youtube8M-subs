00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.509
 a right way in reality 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 If we want, it 's the newest trip. 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.200
 Do you know why in the election year 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.980
 government spends so much money 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.980
 with advertisements because it's your money 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.079
 if it is an improper oven to use 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.970
 our money as well as being 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.680
 directly an electoral advertisement 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.270
 Why does this occur? 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 according to the electoral law the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.290
 governor is prevented from doing 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.730
 propaganda of his government up to three months 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.309
 before the election 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.010
 but by the end of June he can use and 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.050
 abuse of public funds to promote 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.059
 the justification they give for spending the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.040
 people's money with this self-promotion 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.589
 is to say that they are informing society 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.570
 about public acts 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.670
 but this is not true of our 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 constitution directs that advertising 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.509
 of public works and services 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.990
 must be educationally informative 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.869
 or social orientation and certainly the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.899
 advertisements that spend every day on the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.179
 tv radio and newspapers are not useful 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.910
 as a vaccination campaign 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.830
 for example in election year 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.649
 most of the state governors 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.910
 invests heavily in advertisements but in 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.860
 2014 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.840
 ceará will be the third state in the country 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.920
 who spent more on this type of 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.220
 publicity 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.660
 the state government will spend more than 105 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.729
 millions of reais 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.550
 is so high that it goes beyond 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.759
 to the expenses of the secretary of culture and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.190
 the secretariat of the sport and among 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.950
 advertising expenses we found 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.069
 including a budget for the improvement of 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.709
 institutional image the best image 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.959
 institutional government is not spending 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.720
 public money improperly 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.789
 will it be that a state where the people suffer 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 a huge drought and we have serious problems 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.940
 of health 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.470
 we can afford to spend 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.930
 million reais in advertising with 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.640
 people smiling and singing while 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.400
 That same money could really be 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 used to build more than 10,000 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 wells or the 30 units ready 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 this kind of service that you can 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.430
 wonder why we do not see 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.379
 communication monitoring the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.629
 denouncing this frequently and 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.280
 bails because if the same newspaper 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.849
 This is to make an advertisement like 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 That 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.900
 discuss this kind of thing the government 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.900
 Paraíba 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 The truth is that both the secretary 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.829
 government agencies billions of reais in 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.140
 hands of a few we simply can not 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.420
 say that we are outraged that we 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.439
 Let's note that we're going to vote this out. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.090
 it's not protest 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.450
 if you really want to change some 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.760
 to inspect 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.870
 politics to politics in ceará and in brazil 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.079
 it is dirty and dangerous but participating in it is 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.190
 the only way to change this situation 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.190
 Welcome to politics.
