00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this is what is going to be vulture

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
this is what is going to be vulture
eight<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> might<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.530> volt<00:01:28.770> right<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
eight it might be volt right here the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
eight it might be volt right here the
next<00:01:29.549> picture<00:01:29.700> you'll<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:30.630> bit

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
next picture you'll see a little bit

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
next picture you'll see a little bit
more<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.729> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
more of it so just kind of look in the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.300 
more of it so just kind of look in the
very<00:01:33.869> bottom<00:01:34.170> right-hand<00:01:34.530> corner<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.189> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
very bottom right-hand corner that's on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.090 
very bottom right-hand corner that's on
the<00:01:35.460> side<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.210> zombies<00:01:36.540> arm<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the side of the zombies arm now and a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.260 
the side of the zombies arm now and a
lot<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.820> thinking<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
lot of people are thinking that this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
lot of people are thinking that this
might<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.840> vulture<00:01:40.290> aid<00:01:40.470> some<00:01:40.740> people<00:01:40.950> also

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
might be vulture aid some people also

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880 
might be vulture aid some people also
believe<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> juggernog<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.140> think

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
believe that this is juggernog I think

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
believe that this is juggernog I think
it<00:01:44.009> kind<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> follows<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.909> vulture<00:01:45.479> aid<00:01:45.750> luck

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it kind of follows that vulture aid luck

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.420 
it kind of follows that vulture aid luck
more<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> has<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> orange

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
more because it kind of has that orange

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
more because it kind of has that orange
tint<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.210> didn't<00:01:48.450> show<00:01:48.570> us<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.899> much

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
tint to it they didn't show us very much

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
tint to it they didn't show us very much
of<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.240> treyarch

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
of it but that's kind of what treyarch

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
of it but that's kind of what treyarch
enjoys<00:01:52.049> doing<00:01:52.380> hinting<00:01:52.860> things<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.310> then

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
enjoys doing hinting things and then

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
enjoys doing hinting things and then
making<00:01:53.610> us<00:01:53.790> wonder<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> could

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
making us wonder about it so it could

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
making us wonder about it so it could
quite<00:01:55.829> possibly<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.850> vulture<00:01:57.270> aid<00:01:57.390> /

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
quite possibly be the vulture aid /

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
quite possibly be the vulture aid /
maybe<00:01:58.200> juggernog<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.369> could<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.490> be

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
maybe juggernog or it could just be

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
maybe juggernog or it could just be
something<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.659> light<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:02.219> just
