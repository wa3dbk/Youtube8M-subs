inventory and it also gives you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.050 
inventory and it also gives you
saturation<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.460> basically<00:01:32.670> means<00:01:32.939> you'll

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
saturation which basically means you'll

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
saturation which basically means you'll
get<00:01:33.270> hungry<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.869> lit<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.380> won't<00:01:34.560> get

hungry<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:34.950> longer<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:36.030> she<00:01:36.150> makes<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
hungry for longer and as she makes it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
hungry for longer and as she makes it
the<00:01:36.540> best<00:01:36.720> food<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.460> eat

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the best food for that so if you eat

longest time a penny food so this is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330

because it's so good at hunger and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.260 
because it's so good at hunger and
saturation<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> two<00:01:53.729> parts<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
saturation which are the two parts of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
saturation which are the two parts of
not<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:54.689> hungry<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.170> being<00:01:55.350> able<00:01:55.470> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so yeah let's go next into the the two

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.959 
so yeah let's go next into the the two
apple<00:02:01.290> types<00:02:01.530> because<00:02:01.920> they're<00:02:02.130> fairly<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
apple types because they're fairly you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030 
apple types because they're fairly you
know<00:02:03.000> different<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.689> food<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.890> you're

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
know different to just food as you're
probably<00:02:05.130> aware<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.520> you've<00:02:05.640> ever<00:02:05.759> used<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.969> go

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
probably aware if you've ever used to go

so<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> Golden<00:02:07.740> Apple<00:02:07.829> itself<00:02:08.399> unlike<00:02:08.879> on

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
so the Golden Apple itself unlike on

so the Golden Apple itself unlike on
said<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.179> being<00:02:10.300> introduced<00:02:10.599> ingots

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
said of just being introduced ingots

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.720 
said of just being introduced ingots
like<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.349> used<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> be<00:02:11.739> able<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.459> Xbox

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
like you used to be able to in the Xbox

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.030 
like you used to be able to in the Xbox
version<00:02:12.909> they<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.080> change<00:02:14.349> it<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.920> a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
version they actually change it in a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.559 
version they actually change it in a
later<00:02:15.250> update<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:15.700> I'd<00:02:15.819> imagine<00:02:15.940> they'll

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
later update but I'd imagine they'll

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.539 
later update but I'd imagine they'll
change<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.019> at<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> same<00:02:17.349> time<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:18.280> they<00:02:18.430> do

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
change it at the same time as they do

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.890 
change it at the same time as they do
they<00:02:18.700> own<00:02:18.819> Apple<00:02:19.120> stuff<00:02:19.299> but<00:02:19.480> they<00:02:19.569> change<00:02:19.780> its

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
they own Apple stuff but they change its

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.289 
they own Apple stuff but they change its

beat golden ingot since the sorry yeah

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.050 
beat golden ingot since the sorry yeah
gold<00:02:22.599> ingots<00:02:22.959> instead<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.349> gold<00:02:23.470> nuggets<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
gold ingots instead of gold nuggets and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.220 
gold ingots instead of gold nuggets and
this<00:02:25.060> gives<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> Golden<00:02:25.780> Apple<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this gives you the Golden Apple which is

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.009 
this gives you the Golden Apple which is
blue<00:02:26.650> text<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.849> sure<00:02:28.060> that's<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
blue text and would sure that's it's the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.780 
blue text and would sure that's it's the
simplest<00:02:29.349> way<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.530> spread<00:02:30.459> shoot<00:02:30.670> them

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
simplest way to spread shoot them

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.830 
simplest way to spread shoot them
because<00:02:30.910> although<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.420> other<00:02:31.510> ones<00:02:31.660> called

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
because although the other ones called

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.300 
because although the other ones called
the<00:02:31.870> enchanted<00:02:31.989> golden<00:02:32.470> apple<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.890> game<00:02:33.129> I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the enchanted golden apple in game I

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.710 
the enchanted golden apple in game I
think<00:02:33.549> they're<00:02:33.670> both<00:02:33.819> called<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.209> go<00:02:34.330> nephal

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
think they're both called the go nephal

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.630 
think they're both called the go nephal
BS<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.829> get<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.099> golden<00:02:36.310> apple<00:02:36.549> that's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
BS so you get the golden apple that's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.580 
BS so you get the golden apple that's
like<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.360> all<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.930> does<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.319> does<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
like this and all this does it does the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.899 
like this and all this does it does the
same<00:02:38.709> thing<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:39.040> work<00:02:39.190> your<00:02:39.370> own<00:02:39.489> Apple<00:02:39.760> does

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
same thing I work your own Apple does

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.550 
same thing I work your own Apple does
it's<00:02:40.180> still<00:02:40.510> an<00:02:40.599> investment<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:41.349> eight

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

yellow<00:02:52.359> heart<00:02:52.569> says<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.810> also<00:02:53.170> gives<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.470> a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
yellow heart says it also gives you a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.319 
yellow heart says it also gives you a
solution<00:02:53.769> which<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.160> extra<00:02:54.459> hearts<00:02:54.700> that

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
solution which is extra hearts that

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.610 
solution which is extra hearts that
doesn't<00:02:55.569> go<00:02:55.660> into<00:02:55.750> Xbox<00:02:56.079> for<00:02:56.230> quite<00:02:56.379> some<00:02:56.590> time

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
doesn't go into Xbox for quite some time

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380 
doesn't go into Xbox for quite some time
so<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:57.069> doubt<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.400> would<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:57.879> included<00:02:58.299> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
so I doubt that would be included and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.599 
so I doubt that would be included and
you<00:02:58.480> go<00:02:58.629> nap<00:02:58.840> oh<00:02:58.959> it'd<00:02:59.109> be<00:02:59.140> nice<00:02:59.500> though<00:02:59.769> so

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
you go nap oh it'd be nice though so

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.580 
you go nap oh it'd be nice though so
yeah<00:03:00.819> let's<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:01.180> next<00:03:01.599> into<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:01.989> enchanted

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
yeah let's go next into the enchanted

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.140 
yeah let's go next into the enchanted
girl<00:03:02.709> necklace<00:03:03.099> so<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.579> big<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
girl necklace so this is the big one and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.030 
girl necklace so this is the big one and
this<00:03:04.569> is<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> one<00:03:05.079> that's<00:03:05.230> gonna<00:03:05.440> involve<00:03:05.709> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
this is the one that's gonna involve a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.039 
this is the one that's gonna involve a
lot<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:07.000> craft<00:03:07.359> this<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.840> need

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
lot because to craft this you need

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.960 
lot because to craft this you need
golden<00:03:08.410> blocks<00:03:08.799> instead<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.400> golden<00:03:09.700> ingots

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
golden blocks instead of golden ingots

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.400 
golden blocks instead of golden ingots
so<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:11.079> need<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.379> mine<00:03:12.420> 54<00:03:13.420> individual<00:03:14.139> pieces

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
so you need to mine 54 individual pieces

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.009 
so you need to mine 54 individual pieces
of<00:03:14.650> gold<00:03:14.829> like<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:16.299> then<00:03:16.450> obviously<00:03:16.630> I'm

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
of gold like this and then obviously I'm

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.420 
of gold like this and then obviously I'm
just<00:03:17.200> gonna<00:03:17.349> make<00:03:17.650> them<00:03:17.829> all<00:03:17.919> at<00:03:18.040> once<00:03:18.190> because

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
just gonna make them all at once because

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.240 
just gonna make them all at once because
it'll<00:03:18.579> save<00:03:18.760> time<00:03:19.139> but<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.470> need<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.709> make<00:03:20.829> 64

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
it'll save time but you need to make 64

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.800 
it'll save time but you need to make 64
individual<00:03:21.940> blocks<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:22.359> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.660> imagine

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
individual blocks which you can imagine

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.339 
individual blocks which you can imagine
not<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.530> easiest<00:03:23.919> task<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.609> world<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.970> do

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
not the easiest task in the world to do

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.789 
not the easiest task in the world to do
so<00:03:26.349> yeah<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.599> lot<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.079> there<00:03:29.680> we

so yeah that's like a lot and there we

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:30.920 
so yeah that's like a lot and there we
go

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
go

in<00:04:23.650> my<00:04:23.889> opinion<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.400> let's<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:25.000> eat<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.300> right

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
in my opinion so let's just eat it right

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.820 
in my opinion so let's just eat it right
now<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.230> there's<00:04:26.440> no<00:04:26.560> hunger

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
now you know there's no hunger

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.810 
now you know there's no hunger
requirement<00:04:27.220> for<00:04:27.280> eating<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.490> two<00:04:27.610> golden

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
requirement for eating the two golden

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.100 
requirement for eating the two golden
apples<00:04:27.880> as<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.240> said<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.690> looks<00:04:28.840> like<00:04:28.990> it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
apples as I said so it looks like it

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.600 
apples as I said so it looks like it
just<00:04:29.290> does<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.590> right<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.190> actually<00:04:30.460> gives

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
just does that right but actually gives

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.670 
just does that right but actually gives
you<00:04:30.669> 30<00:04:30.940> seconds<00:04:31.389> of<00:04:31.540> regeneration<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.470> think

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
you 30 seconds of regeneration I think

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.080 
you 30 seconds of regeneration I think
it's<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> best<00:04:33.100> regeneration<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.850> slight

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
it's the best regeneration the slight

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.600 
it's the best regeneration the slight
different<00:04:34.450> ears<00:04:34.660> which<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:36.040> know<00:04:36.160> kind<00:04:36.460> of

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
different ears which is you know kind of

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.350 
different ears which is you know kind of
ridiculous<00:04:37.590> because<00:04:38.590> if<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.580> guess<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.150> I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
ridiculous because if I I guess I I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.700 
ridiculous because if I I guess I I
could<00:04:40.750> probably<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.020> lose<00:04:41.320> some<00:04:41.530> how<00:04:41.650> to

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
could probably just lose some how to

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.220 
could probably just lose some how to
show<00:04:41.980> you<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.250> it's<00:04:43.240> really<00:04:43.660> really<00:04:44.080> really

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
show you that it's really really really

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.960 
show you that it's really really really
fast<00:04:44.500> regeneration<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.610> just<00:04:45.760> sort<00:04:45.940> of

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
fast regeneration and you just sort of

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.960 
fast regeneration and you just sort of
help<00:04:46.150> binds<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.570> recover<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.919> yes<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.370> fast

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
help binds and recover but yes so fast

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.050 
help binds and recover but yes so fast
regeneration<00:04:49.660> for<00:04:49.930> 30<00:04:50.200> seconds<00:04:50.889> in<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:51.880> later

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
regeneration for 30 seconds in a later

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.490 
regeneration for 30 seconds in a later
update<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.419> gives<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.810> two<00:04:52.930> extra<00:04:53.169> hearts

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
update it gives you the two extra hearts

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.320 
update it gives you the two extra hearts
and<00:04:53.980> then<00:04:54.100> I'll<00:04:54.220> top<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:54.970> fire

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
and then I'll top of that you get fire

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.690 
and then I'll top of that you get fire
resistant<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.560> at<00:04:57.190> some<00:04:57.400> point<00:04:57.580> you

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
resistant so you can at some point you

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.010 
resistant so you can at some point you
can<00:04:57.850> literally<00:04:58.120> just<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.389> straight<00:04:58.840> through

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
can literally just go straight through

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.210 
can literally just go straight through
fire<00:04:59.260> which<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.470> ridiculous

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
fire which is ridiculous

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.159 
fire which is ridiculous
then<00:05:00.850> there's<00:05:01.030> extra<00:05:01.330> distance<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.810> damage

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
then there's extra distance to damage

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.550 
then there's extra distance to damage
right<00:05:02.320> there<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.830> I<00:05:04.200> believe<00:05:05.200> there<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.440> a

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
right there so I believe there is a

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.900 
right there so I believe there is a
little<00:05:05.800> statistic<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.490> there's<00:05:06.669> nothing

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
little statistic that there's nothing

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.640 
little statistic that there's nothing
that<00:05:07.090> can<00:05:07.240> kill<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.840> if<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.169> have<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.350> bench

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
that can kill you if you have a bench

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.890 
that can kill you if you have a bench
article<00:05:09.100> nipple<00:05:09.430> eaten<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.510> last<00:05:10.540> 30

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
article nipple eaten in the last 30

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.409 
article nipple eaten in the last 30
seconds<00:05:11.410> except<00:05:12.160> for<00:05:12.370> literally<00:05:12.880> falling<00:05:13.270> out

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
seconds except for literally falling out

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.060 
seconds except for literally falling out
of<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.750> map<00:05:13.900> on<00:05:14.080> PC<00:05:14.440> which<00:05:14.620> isn't<00:05:14.770> something

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
of the map on PC which isn't something

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.129 
of the map on PC which isn't something
we<00:05:15.310> can't<00:05:15.550> do<00:05:15.700> on<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.850> Xbox<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:16.720> there's<00:05:16.930> no

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
we can't do on the Xbox so there's no

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.500 
we can't do on the Xbox so there's no
way<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.410> die<00:05:17.680> for<00:05:17.740> 30<00:05:18.130> seconds<00:05:18.729> once<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.360> eat

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
way to die for 30 seconds once you eat

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.659 
way to die for 30 seconds once you eat
this<00:05:19.750> go<00:05:20.560> in<00:05:20.740> Charter<00:05:21.040> Golden<00:05:21.310> Apple<00:05:21.400> which<00:05:21.639> is

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
this go in Charter Golden Apple which is

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.570 
this go in Charter Golden Apple which is
it's<00:05:22.180> pretty<00:05:22.450> ridiculous<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.860> it's<00:05:24.040> honestly

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
it's pretty ridiculous and it's honestly

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.860 
it's pretty ridiculous and it's honestly
if<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.940> want<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.180> fight<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.450> river<00:05:25.600> it's

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
if you want to fight the river it's

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.510 
if you want to fight the river it's
probably<00:05:26.229> your<00:05:26.380> best<00:05:26.560> bet<00:05:26.710> if<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.010> wanted<00:05:27.370> you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
probably your best bet if you wanted you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.770 
probably your best bet if you wanted you
know<00:05:27.640> just<00:05:27.820> get<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.000> damage<00:05:28.360> done<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.750> just

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
know just get the damage done and just

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.290 
know just get the damage done and just
tank<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.289> that<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.220> some<00:05:30.370> armor<00:05:30.550> maybe<00:05:30.820> might

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
tank it that and some armor maybe might

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.969 
tank it that and some armor maybe might
you<00:05:31.510> know<00:05:31.630> help<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:32.080> out<00:05:32.140> one<00:05:32.410> win<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.800> one

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
you know help you out one win that one

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.520 
you know help you out one win that one
so<00:05:33.700> yeah<00:05:33.820> that's<00:05:34.060> how<00:05:34.180> that's<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.169> three<00:05:35.350> new
