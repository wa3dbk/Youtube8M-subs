00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi guys this is part three of my short

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.660 
hi guys this is part three of my short
videos<00:00:03.600> on<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.899> input<00:00:04.170> program<00:00:04.490> we're<00:00:05.490> going

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
videos on the input program we're going

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.860 
videos on the input program we're going
to<00:00:05.730> do<00:00:05.850> today<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.180> as<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:06.600> tell<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to do today is as you can tell the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.299 
to do today is as you can tell the
motors<00:00:07.170> running<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.649> car<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.160> bit

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
motors running in my car it's a bit

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.200 
motors running in my car it's a bit
noisy<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> garage<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:10.010> I'll<00:00:11.010> need<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.730> do

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
noisy in the garage but I'll need to do

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.650 
noisy in the garage but I'll need to do
some<00:00:12.240> vibrating

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.130 

when<00:00:18.109> to<00:00:18.470> be<00:00:19.220> 39<00:00:19.730> engine

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
when to be 39 engine

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.020 
when to be 39 engine
go<00:00:21.619> across<00:00:21.800> 2<00:00:22.009> mae7<00:00:22.310> point<00:00:23.000> 2

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.180 

now<00:00:26.540> with<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.410> motor<00:00:27.590> running<00:00:29.619> what<00:00:30.619> this

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
now with the motor running what this

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.070 
now with the motor running what this
program<00:00:31.640> allows<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.090> do<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:32.360> allows<00:00:32.900> you

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
program allows you to do is allows you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.410 
program allows you to do is allows you
to<00:00:33.230> look<00:00:33.380> at<00:00:33.530> live<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:36.530> engine<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.270> way

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
to look at live the engine and the way

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.270 
to look at live the engine and the way
it's<00:00:38.600> running<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.170> roughness<00:00:39.830> if<00:00:40.040> there's<00:00:40.220> a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
it's running the roughness if there's a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.850 
it's running the roughness if there's a
problem<00:00:40.520> with<00:00:41.110> something<00:00:42.110> of<00:00:42.320> Venice<00:00:42.650> or

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
problem with something of Venice or

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.780 
problem with something of Venice or
something<00:00:43.250> in<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.430> car<00:00:45.129> as<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:46.220> can<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.580> here

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
something in the car as you can see here

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.470 
something in the car as you can see here
what<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:47.180> doing<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:48.050> hit<00:00:48.739> f5<00:00:49.280> which<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.449> a

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
what I'm doing is I hit f5 which is a

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.070 
what I'm doing is I hit f5 which is a
read<00:00:51.370> status<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.989> it's<00:00:53.989> got<00:00:54.140> digital<00:00:54.620> values

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
read status and it's got digital values

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.549 
read status and it's got digital values
f1<00:00:57.080> f2<00:00:57.230> f3<00:00:57.379> f4<00:00:57.980> f5<00:00:58.700> f6<00:00:58.969> analog<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.320> we're<00:01:00.440> going

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 analog so we're going

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.450 
f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 analog so we're going
to<00:01:00.620> do<00:01:00.710> today<00:01:00.829> we're<00:01:00.950> gonna<00:01:01.100> have<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.280> look<00:01:01.370> at

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
to do today we're gonna have a look at

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.060 
to do today we're gonna have a look at
the<00:01:01.520> analog<00:01:02.000> values<00:01:02.660> one<00:01:02.989> which<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.620> if<00:01:04.030> full

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
the analog values one which is if full

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.680 
the analog values one which is if full
and<00:01:07.070> all<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:07.310> cool<00:01:07.550> stuff<00:01:07.700> cuts<00:01:08.149> starts

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
and all this cool stuff cuts starts

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.510 
and all this cool stuff cuts starts
coming<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.350> shows<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.250> things<00:01:10.369> like

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
coming up and it shows you things like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.000 
coming up and it shows you things like

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
you can see that each of the cylinders

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.910 
you can see that each of the cylinders
got<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.890> performing

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
got it performing

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.420 
got it performing
mine<00:02:34.520> are<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:34.790> pretty<00:02:35.090> good<00:02:35.270> pretty<00:02:35.570> stable

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
mine are all pretty good pretty stable

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.210 
mine are all pretty good pretty stable
I've<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.850> friend's<00:02:38.270> car<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.220> he's

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I've put it on a friend's car and he's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.310 
I've put it on a friend's car and he's
cylinder<00:02:40.940> six<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:42.320> off<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.680> scale<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:44.320> gravel

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
cylinder six is off the scale and gravel

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.660 
cylinder six is off the scale and gravel
to<00:02:45.410> determine<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.100> was<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.430> spark

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
to determine that it was just a spark

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.230 
to determine that it was just a spark
plug<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.490> great<00:02:49.730> program<00:02:49.970> for

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
plug so it's a great program for

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.860 
plug so it's a great program for
allowing<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.470> check<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.790> know<00:02:52.820> parts<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
allowing you to check you know parts of

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.570 
allowing you to check you know parts of
the<00:02:53.960> car<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.380> do<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> bit<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.800> DIY<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.490> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the car and do a bit of DIY with the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.470 
the car and do a bit of DIY with the
help<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:56.650> Beamer<00:02:57.650> form<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.220> manifest<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
help of Beamer form of a manifest and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.880 
help of Beamer form of a manifest and
then<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.750> click<00:03:02.959> back

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.320 

and<00:03:09.370> then

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
and then

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.240 
and then
and<00:03:11.840> now<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.470> say<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.710> turn<00:03:13.040> your<00:03:13.190> ignition
