00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 see here the room is not lit at all 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:20.359
 here is our light bulb we take and light 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:20.359
 on the beam like a spotlight 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.120
 if we need a spotlight then it turned out 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.790
 can do this for running lights in 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.610
 car only drivers will need 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.269
 12 volts and smaller diodes 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:50.290
 instead of water, pour something over 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.019
 suitable alcohol or what 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.690
 non-freezing now we will go out 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:01.230
 there we will light the way if we do not need 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.360
 such a ray is just shaking glass 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.390
 I think this ray will not just be 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:20.259
 and a bright white tube right now under on 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:33.360
 the street well here went outside the string here 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:33.360
 not very long so stunned 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:02:00.729
 better than any headlights great dipped 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:02:04.450
 can get eaten good you not 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:12.540
 expected such an effect and honestly say well 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 very cool all the experiment is over
