 you have hundreds of 60 people 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.170
 a little bit 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.170
 a hundred 60 people no electricity 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.960
 just like here 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 St end

 besides Benzing suitable 1 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.110
 mostly you have difficulties 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.320
 to knit it to follow 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.350
 the end

 the left corner 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 the right of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 the other places 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.310
 with the left left side for Bingen as easy 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.010
 on the left side 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.850
 Continue knitting 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.060
 the end 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 use 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.430
 incomprehensible 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 Neumann 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.090
 untenrum 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.830
 pretty strict 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 Mr on one side 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.370
 take the pendulum 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.810
 and then end 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.570
 long distances 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.110
 and this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.630
 manufacture

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.669
 right 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.079
 and said 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.019
 prevent 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.119
 A setback, of course, could happen 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.349
 further routes 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.869
 not now 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.959
 a great idea
