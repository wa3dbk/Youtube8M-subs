 [Music] 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.140
 put your faces forethought when you see 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.970
 this sign this packaging very easy what 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.880
 I have taken from google 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.010
 I have done a color photocopy is very 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.920
 nice to make a detail to someone 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.050
 that you really like these cookies these 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.559
 sweet or what you call there in your 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.199
 country 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.770
 I've done it because they've been a lot of 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.140
 requests so I've already brought you 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.590
 let's go with the recipe and for this sweet 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.920
 we will need some type cookies 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 digestyc we also need sugar 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.490
 glass or impalpable peanut butter or 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.120
 peanut 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.410
 of milk and dark chocolate to melt 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 it can also be right chocolate 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.530
 the first thing is to chop the chocolate and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.570
 melt it we can put it in the water bath and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.720
 we can also do it in the microwave 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.810
 with the defrost mode this will be 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 30 in 30 seconds and we have 30 seconds 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.010
 we take out remove if it's not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 sufficiently melted we will return to 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.980
 same process always very carefully 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:35.399
 and that we do not burn chocolate 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:35.399
 [Music] 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.530
 for this show we also need a 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.170
 mold about 18 centimeters and another one 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.510
 little bit smaller we're going to decorate everything 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.990
 our chocolate container 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.740
 with the help of our brush and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.740
 our spatula 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.930
 [Music] 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.630
 once well extended we are going to put 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.060
 in the freezer 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.760
 meanwhile we will make the cream of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 peanut or peanut with a process of the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.250
 little girl or manually we're going to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.130
 crush some cookies these have us 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 to give as thin as possible once 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.780
 well crushed we will put them in a bowl 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.280
 big because here we're going to mix the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.479
 rest of the ingredients 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.479
 [Music] 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.680
 and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.620
 take the dough that we have prepared and the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.050
 we will put in the container this will be 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.310
 to give it the inner shape 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.260
 [Music] 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.599
 and we have our chocolate base already 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.239
 freeze and here I have our base 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.400
 peanut interior as you see is something 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.640
 smaller because it has to go in the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 center we are going to place it so that 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.910
 we are well centered 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.920
 As you see, I put a piece of paper for 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.020
 make handling easier than not 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.860
 it breaks too much so now remove 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.040
 the paper and we will stay more or less in the 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.890
 center and now with the chocolate that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.940
 we had melted, we're going to fill it 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.540
 once again filled the cold 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260
 that set and so be able to demold a lot 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.789
 plus 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.789
 [Music] 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.299
 and once the side we can unmold 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.340
 you can also do the mini I've 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.590
 I took advantage and I made a few 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.349
 You see by the same procedure 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.780
 we are left exactly the same does not 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.000
 missing that these capsules are 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.859
 silicone you can take advantage of the capsules 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.690
 of paper as you see perfect and now 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.910
 let's unmold this 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.400
 but that you liked it if it is this way 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.510
 milestone above do not forget subscribe and 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.980
 come back soon bye 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.980
