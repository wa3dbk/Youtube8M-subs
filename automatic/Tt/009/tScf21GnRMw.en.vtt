00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
first he also said to simulate the main

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340 
first he also said to simulate the main
drain<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> time<00:00:36.480> being<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.320> a

drain for the time being if you have a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.080 
drain for the time being if you have a
vacuum<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.820> take<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
vacuum which we do you can take the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
vacuum which we do you can take the
vacuum<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> upside<00:00:40.710> down<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
bottom of the pool pumping straight from

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
bottom of the pool pumping straight from
the<00:00:44.280> suction<00:00:44.760> hole<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> bottom<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the suction hole in the bottom of the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840 
the suction hole in the bottom of the

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
it's upside down the other one looks

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.770 
it's upside down the other one looks
like<00:04:47.759> it's<00:04:47.879> sinking<00:04:48.150> into<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.360> sinkhole

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
like it's sinking into a sinkhole

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.600 
like it's sinking into a sinkhole
I<00:04:48.960> think<00:04:49.409> Ripley's<00:04:49.830> looks<00:04:50.069> like<00:04:50.219> it's<00:04:50.370> singing

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
I think Ripley's looks like it's singing

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.279 
I think Ripley's looks like it's singing
into<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.849> sinkhole<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.419> WonderWorks<00:04:52.110> is

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
into a sinkhole and WonderWorks is

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:52.999 
into a sinkhole and WonderWorks is
upside<00:04:52.590> down

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
upside down

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.670 
upside down
I<00:04:53.039> think<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.520> way<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.789> is<00:04:53.849> so<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:55.020> kind<00:04:55.650> of

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
I think this way it is so that kind of

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.080 
I think this way it is so that kind of
proves<00:04:55.919> my<00:04:56.099> point<00:04:56.129> right<00:04:56.520> there<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.759> I<00:04:56.849> can't

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
proves my point right there is I can't

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.879 
proves my point right there is I can't
remember<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.840> difference<00:04:58.229> between<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.710> two

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
remember the difference between the two

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.189 
remember the difference between the two
but<00:04:59.460> if<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.699> guys<00:04:59.879> came<00:05:00.150> over<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.020> you
