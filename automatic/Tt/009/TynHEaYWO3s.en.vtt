00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
actually used this program before I've

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.689 
actually used this program before I've
used<00:05:21.699> other<00:05:21.940> DVD<00:05:22.750> authoring<00:05:23.280> programs<00:05:24.280> before

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
like encore and whatever the heck the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.939 
like encore and whatever the heck the
thing<00:05:28.510> is<00:05:28.630> called<00:05:28.900> that<00:05:29.110> comes<00:05:29.260> with<00:05:29.470> Vegas

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
thing is called that comes with Vegas

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.240 
thing is called that comes with Vegas
that<00:05:30.789> DVD<00:05:31.260> program<00:05:32.260> so<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:32.949> not<00:05:33.099> too

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
that DVD program so it's not too

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.830 
that DVD program so it's not too
difficult<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.849> in<00:05:33.940> fact<00:05:34.090> DVD<00:05:34.510> Studio<00:05:34.780> Pro

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
difficult and in fact DVD Studio Pro

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.719 
difficult and in fact DVD Studio Pro
seems<00:05:35.169> much<00:05:35.440> more<00:05:35.620> powerful<00:05:36.039> than<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.490> other

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
seems much more powerful than the other

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.279 
seems much more powerful than the other
two<00:05:36.940> just<00:05:37.419> cool<00:05:37.599> because<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:38.080> can<00:05:38.110> do<00:05:38.260> all

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
two just cool because you can do all

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.610 
two just cool because you can do all
this<00:05:38.470> cool<00:05:38.650> stuff<00:05:38.849> probably<00:05:39.849> get<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.180> to

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
this cool stuff probably get it to
