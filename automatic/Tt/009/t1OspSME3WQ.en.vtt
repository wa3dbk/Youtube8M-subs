does that look like something most of
you<00:01:00.210> could<00:01:00.710> handle<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.949> meal<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.870> too

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you could handle at a meal it's not too

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.390 
you could handle at a meal it's not too
much<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:05.640> how<00:01:05.790> many<00:01:05.970> calories<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.659> at

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
much is it well how many calories is at

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.859 
much is it well how many calories is at
600<00:01:08.400> calories<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:10.020> represents

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
600 calories and that represents

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
600 calories and that represents
twenty-five<00:01:12.869> percent<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> daily<00:01:14.070> calorie

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
twenty-five percent of the daily calorie

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.350 
twenty-five percent of the daily calorie
needs<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.689> man<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.939> about<00:01:17.939> thirty<00:01:18.270> percent

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
needs for a man and about thirty percent

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.830 
needs for a man and about thirty percent
of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> daily<00:01:19.380> calories<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> woman<00:01:20.840> okay

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of the daily calories for a woman okay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
of the daily calories for a woman okay
so<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.340> too<00:01:23.340> unreasonable<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so it's not too unreasonable but is that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.310 
so it's not too unreasonable but is that
