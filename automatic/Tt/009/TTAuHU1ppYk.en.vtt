 inconveniences and not aim 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.039
 to the attribution of possible faults or 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.039
 responsibility 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.350

 accident or serious incident 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.960
 is started following the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.570
 communication to the nsv of the relative 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.550
 event is then named a 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 investigator who is in charge 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.830
 organization and execution 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.930
 of the safety investigation in the case of 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.940
 a particularly complex investigation 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.550
 the investigator coordinates a team 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.690
 investigative 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.110
 the investigation begins with an inspection 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.910
 operating on the event website 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 finalized to the acquisition also 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.740
 through photographic video recordings 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.160
 of the first necessary evidences 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.170
 understand and dynamics for example 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.490
 ground tracks distribution of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.869
 scrap type of damage reported 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 the carrying out of the inspection is not 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.560
 always easy because of accidents 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 can occur in inaccessible locations 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 sometimes difficult to access 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.850
 they also come during the investigation 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.340
 acquired other elements such as the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.620
 the international one where at door one 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:07.080
 positive acknowledged contribution for
