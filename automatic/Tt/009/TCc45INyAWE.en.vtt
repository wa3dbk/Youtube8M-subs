00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
oh so that's why we needed the Chaos

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
oh so that's why we needed the Chaos
Emerald<00:01:17.210> exactly<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:19.290> reactivate<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.160> shoot

Emerald exactly to reactivate the shoot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
Emerald exactly to reactivate the shoot
we<00:01:21.510> need<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.350> seven<00:01:22.800> Chaos<00:01:23.070> Emeralds<00:01:24.200> once

we need the seven Chaos Emeralds once

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.740 
we need the seven Chaos Emeralds once
you<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.940> then<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.120> have<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.510> ultimate
