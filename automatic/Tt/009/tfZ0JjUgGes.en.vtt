have no game invites because that's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
have no game invites because that's
really<00:01:57.180> fun<00:01:57.509> I've<00:01:58.200> never<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.590> any<00:01:58.740> gaming

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
right so that's good I guess it's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.830 
right so that's good I guess it's
working<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.500> intended<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.509> and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:03.719> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
working as intended then and then you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.209 
working as intended then and then you
can<00:02:03.960> press<00:02:04.110> play<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
can press play and you can see that you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
can press play and you can see that you
have<00:02:05.310> no<00:02:05.520> no<00:02:05.909> online<00:02:06.420> since<00:02:06.689> ed<00:02:06.960> friends

offline<00:02:15.330> simcity<00:02:15.959> friend<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:18.379> that's<00:02:19.379> a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
offline simcity friend I think that's a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.290 
offline simcity friend I think that's a
noodles<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.220> background<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
noodles in the background here as you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.119 
noodles in the background here as you
can<00:02:21.330> probably<00:02:21.510> hear<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.620> angry<00:02:22.890> you

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
can probably hear it's a bit angry you

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.800 
can probably hear it's a bit angry you
can<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.400> he<00:02:23.970> doesn't<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.420> want<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.720> play

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
can see he doesn't really want to play

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.430 
can see he doesn't really want to play
simcity<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.440> he<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:27.019> actually<00:02:28.019> he

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
simcity but he can so but actually he

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.070 
simcity but he can so but actually he
really<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.010> online<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.180> game<00:02:30.360> says<00:02:30.840> he's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
really is online but the game says he's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.600 
really is online but the game says he's
offline<00:02:31.349> because<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.860> game<00:02:31.980> doesn't<00:02:32.190> want<00:02:32.459> me

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
offline because the game doesn't want me

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.130 
offline because the game doesn't want me
to<00:02:32.700> play<00:02:32.879> with<00:02:33.090> your<00:02:33.209> nails<00:02:33.390> because

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
to play with your nails because

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.839 
to play with your nails because
obviously<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.620> would<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.040> counterintuitive

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
obviously that would be counterintuitive

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.420 
obviously that would be counterintuitive
to<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.049> purpose<00:02:37.379> of<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.530> game<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> to
