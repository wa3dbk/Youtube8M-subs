00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.740 
so this was about 30 bucks shipping was
about<00:01:42.960> three<00:01:43.260> dollars<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:44.570> originally<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.600> was

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
about three dollars so originally it was

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.330 
about three dollars so originally it was
about<00:01:45.900> 25<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:47.580> okay<00:01:48.150> it<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.330> like<00:01:48.450> 27<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.710> this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
about 25 so okay it was like 27 so this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.000 
about 25 so okay it was like 27 so this
one<00:01:50.580> gets<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.090> 220<00:01:51.960> degrees<00:01:51.990> Celsius<00:01:52.320> which

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
one gets up to 220 degrees Celsius which

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.050 
one gets up to 220 degrees Celsius which
is<00:01:53.040> why<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> got<00:01:53.760> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
