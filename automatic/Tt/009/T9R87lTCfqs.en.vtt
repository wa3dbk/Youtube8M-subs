00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.330
 my research group that 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.300
 does basic and applied research focuses on water treatment 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.869
 residuals from different industrial sectors 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.550
 we for example developing applied biological systems 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.659
 for wastewater treatment 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.730
 containing a high content of organic matter 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.919
 which 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.109
 when being eliminated from the waters they are contaminated which is converting to biogas 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.179
 a fuel that can be used by the same sector united 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.510
 that demands us 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.840
 or well used to generate electricity 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 percent we focus on the treatment of different types of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.380
 industrial plants from those that are somewhat simple to be degraded 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 like those of the food sector for example 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.810
 and we also focus on the development of the water treatment system 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.360
 residual 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.110
 farage fronts containing pollutant levels of difficult degradation 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.250
 like those from the textile sector the chemical chemist and 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.560
 petrochemical 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.040
 In this regard we have developed a system that is capable of eliminating 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.870
 sulfur compounds 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.480
 nitrogen and recalcitrants 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.680
 with much shorter reaction times what convention systems 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 to give you an example 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.910
 the referents of the textile sector 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.100
 in the times that are demanded to treat those waters 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.390
 are around 2 or 3 days to achieve a good efficiency of the systems 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.920
 conventional 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.250
 while the systems that we are developing percent achieve the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 same deficiencies in a few hours when we install a plant 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.210
 wastewater treatment for this type of sources will be the plants 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 of treatment much more compact and that therefore demand a lower 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.390
 space for your installation thing that for some companies or insane these 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.990
 very attractive for the small spaces they have for installation
