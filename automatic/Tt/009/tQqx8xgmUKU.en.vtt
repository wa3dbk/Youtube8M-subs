00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.460
 yes we come to the lynx x4 first 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.900
 person view a little pretty way 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.090
 drone in the back red in front blue blue 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.950
 shine so were the camera turns on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 for this one is short and connects 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.320
 then with the camera and with the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.939
 they drone me that too 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130
 camera image which just transferred directly 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.849
 becomes 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.769
 Very good quality for the laying is 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:39.170
 just no full hd you just have to 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:46.700
 know yes flies just like that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:49.950
 model without camera and the special case 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 where is the direct transfer 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399
 on the screen 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.219
 Just write the screen 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.219
 That's what the sisters look like 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.140
 I'm just trying this way 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.140
 to fly high as possible 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 faith is under control and 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.010
 the connection breaks off 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 I think I'm already at the 50th 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.229
 come about meter 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 There you can pretty much over the forest 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 look 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.009
 the rushing up to the picture that lies 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.540
 because that just takes whatever 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.910
 on the camera as well as the germs 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.340
 is transmitted 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.000
 I do not know you later you are 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 not in the crown 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 exactly and the first time for spurs on us 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.040
 I want to do I think it is the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 right is a lot of fun and is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.070
 also incredibly difficult only on the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.450
 screen to watch so it needs 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.600
 really win from me too for 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.790
 This equipment is clear buying recommendation 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.380
 a nice little helicopter for around 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.590
 150 euros 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.489
 where you can try the first time 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.080
 and just play a little bit 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.640
 can also do little tricks 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.380
 make flips channel 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.170
 you also have a good range 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.989
 and think before you can do such a thing 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.630
 you can bring real big drone with you 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.940
 practice the thing a bit and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.739
 try it out and I think so well 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 invested money and does one too 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.489
 lots of fun and therefore clear 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.489
 Purchase recommendation and have fun with it
