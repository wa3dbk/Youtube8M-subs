00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.460
 Souvenir new product comes out something like 9 minutes I know whether it is serious or not English is this It is release 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.029
 This is probably what so 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 Has been released from this is I garax stick What I'm play likely this 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.989
 It is a function caper called sdi mini computer 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.989
 Otherwise great or it is a computer system 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.910
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 car 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.300
 This is it that the actual ordinary accelerator that it is a car you do not have it installed there is what effect 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 When I stepped in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.140
 that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 Though it becomes fusion with 4 queens 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.420
 Yes , this is stressful, but the response is bad Fankhan 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.490
 Yes Ano Responsible species it by attaching it 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.000
 What does it feel like to marry Yuki who will better relieve that stress 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.090
 But it is not know and do not try to ride 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.090
 hey 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 a Hi put in that flowering of the house is wearing the pastor in this vehicle that starts with a little thought and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.159
 But I'd like to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.180
 What is this is this is a response ring 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:37.760
 When refueling air from the layer cleaner 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 It is fed to the engine through a rubber pipe, but by putting this in the use, 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.000
 Squeeze 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:48.800
 So I am the next morning people officer day in the early Let's play air method to easily obtain the sonar wax squeeze 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 Or early the Yappa flow rate of the fine it is I that I 0 in the sinker 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 There's something like this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 It 's a part for who put air into the indie efficiently 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.950
 That's right art toilet and are aimed at the torque up on both on this computer 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.909
 Yes 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.909
 I would like to ride a bit for now 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.090
 It is normal mode now 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.760
 It is normal 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.310
 I 'm checking the atmosphere when I stepped on the engine accelerator in normal mode for a moment now 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.989
 Let's change the mode a little 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.970
 Still Performance Mode Now there are 3 modes and Normal mode 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.600
 Performance mode 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.430
 Rather than put away mode you have this three first mode 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.079
 I want to change 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:46.069
 It puts a certain speed in about now roughly speed Well 80 kilometers 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:50.689
 But such is the Fu to now uphill I thought I when stepping on the accelerator when such 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.319
 The ne such a place I is the moment I mean Tsu Na want a little Polk it is also competing anyway 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.569
 But 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.450
 Of Tackey still referred to as the tachometer at roughly compared to the normal 3,000 rpm before and after 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.840
 From about 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 It's not big down around 3000 rotations though 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.330
 There is a place that accelerates when anti-slip of automa can be done, but the sound and lightness there is ne 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.280
 I feel that 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.280
 This is surprisingly different than normal 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 Not different 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.930
 I feel that the feeling of the torque feeling a little bit above the normal Jiangning Normal is coming out 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.019
 this 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.870
 It is followed by followed by Makishima Yeah Kobe mode this comes out is the most Hey Toka torque power is out 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.100
 Ne 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.120
 Oh 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.310
 The maximum mode is obviously different 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:41.049
 It's about the same level as before, but I'm wearing a high acceleration just before my baby 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:47.500
 If you cut it from constant speed, engine speed will rise and try to pull coke from there 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:51.110
 It has a number of revolutions, but the bottom of the sound atmosphere there is a completely different torque feeling it yet 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.440
 Fire from the house, such as push before a smooth stop and the car 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.880
 It is increasing 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.490
 Perhaps more really it has changed from very low rotation to around 2000 rotation 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.510
 As a driver, going from about 3000 is the best for 3 to 4 years ago 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.510
 Hey, I feel the change 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.940
 Well the sheets are different 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.940
 So I still do 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.489
 Hmm 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.530
 Oh, I have a completely different normal at all 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.690
 This one-time adjustment I'd absolutely no discomfort it is to the minute riding in feeling normal Tteyuu 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.690
 After all , I feel totally different after all 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.919
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.919
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.989
 Now I say another 22,000 yen but I think there may be quite a bargain feeling 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.879
 Let's go 

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:50.999
 This is I want to try all means received in the do this I switch one Tsunesono feeling changes 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:52.990
 This is absolutely deals Kara Tteyuu yet better about 5% from the year backbone 2% it is 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.580
 Ne 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.580
 Kaiserslautern ride or a difference at all
