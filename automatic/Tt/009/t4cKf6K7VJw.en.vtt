00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.499 
highest kill triple nucular so far and I
would<00:00:14.130> say<00:00:14.309> like<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> most<00:00:14.849> scary<00:00:15.179> triple

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
like I said they had LMGs anybody can be

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.750 
like I said they had LMGs anybody can be
good<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> lmg<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> hundred

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
good with the lmg you got a hundred

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
good with the lmg you got a hundred
bullets<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.510> kill<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> two<00:00:51.930> shots<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but anyways besides that the gameplay

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
but anyways besides that the gameplay
will<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.649> bit<00:00:55.920> later

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
will get back to that a little bit later

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
will get back to that a little bit later
on<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> actually<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.539> introduction

on this is actually my introduction
video<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> doom<00:00:58.710> clan<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
video into the doom clan so it's a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
video into the doom clan so it's a
pretty<00:01:00.329> special<00:01:00.930> video<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.859> guess<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> guys

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
pretty special video I guess you guys

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
pretty special video I guess you guys
could<00:01:02.430> say<00:01:02.579> probably<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.030> first<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.539> only

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
could say probably my first and only

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
could say probably my first and only
upload<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> black<00:01:04.680> ops<00:01:04.890> 2<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.430> channel

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
upload of black ops 2 on to this channel

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
upload of black ops 2 on to this channel
I'm<00:01:06.540> sure<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.020> ghost<00:01:07.260> coming<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> stuff

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I'm sure with ghost coming out and stuff

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.960 
I'm sure with ghost coming out and stuff
like<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.310> probably<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
like that I'm probably not going to be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.149 
like that I'm probably not going to be
going<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:10.049> anytime<00:01:10.860> soon

circle I think what should really happen
honestly<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.610> think<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:45.090> youtubers<00:03:45.600> um<00:03:45.900> in

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
honestly I think that youtubers um in

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
honestly I think that youtubers um in
general<00:03:47.010> should<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.549> they<00:03:47.880> should<00:03:48.090> play

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
general should just they should play

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.150 
general should just they should play
solo<00:03:48.840> until<00:03:49.170> solo<00:03:49.410> gets<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.799> point<00:03:49.860> where

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
solo until solo gets to a point where

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.890 
solo until solo gets to a point where
you<00:03:50.370> can't<00:03:50.640> really<00:03:50.910> get<00:03:51.060> higher<00:03:51.299> like<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:51.870> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
you can't really get higher like what I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.050 
you can't really get higher like what I
mean<00:03:52.049> by<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:53.160> know<00:03:53.250> like<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.670> modern

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
