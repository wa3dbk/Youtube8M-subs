bottom bar and the coolest thing about

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.250 
bottom bar and the coolest thing about
this<00:00:31.619> case<00:00:31.890> maybe<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.850> fact<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.079> made

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

here<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.660> round<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> side<00:04:19.200> they<00:04:19.470> made<00:04:19.590> a

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
here the round the side they made a

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 
here the round the side they made a
really<00:04:19.890> nice<00:04:20.130> kind<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.459> pattern

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
really nice kind of pattern

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.650 
really nice kind of pattern
here<00:04:21.960> vibrate<00:04:22.920> switch<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.490> volume<00:04:24.270> rockers

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
here vibrate switch and volume rockers

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.140 
here vibrate switch and volume rockers
are<00:04:24.870> still<00:04:25.080> very<00:04:25.500> easy<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.070> get<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.460> because

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
are still very easy to get to because

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.180 
are still very easy to get to because
it's<00:04:27.330> cut<00:04:27.510> really<00:04:27.960> close<00:04:28.230> there<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.770> then

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it's cut really close there and then

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.710 
it's cut really close there and then
this<00:04:29.280> kind<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.580> comes<00:04:29.760> out<00:04:29.910> over<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> side<00:04:30.450> so

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
this kind of comes out over the side so

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.150 
this kind of comes out over the side so
it's<00:04:30.870> no<00:04:31.080> trouble<00:04:31.350> at<00:04:31.530> all<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.890> reach<00:04:32.010> your

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
it's no trouble at all to reach your

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.880 
it's no trouble at all to reach your
volume<00:04:32.550> buttons<00:04:32.880> or<00:04:33.060> your<00:04:33.180> vibrate<00:04:33.540> switch

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
volume buttons or your vibrate switch

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.230 
volume buttons or your vibrate switch
and<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.100> still<00:04:35.370> gives<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.850> know<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:35.970> decent

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
and it still gives you know a decent

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.810 
and it still gives you know a decent
amount<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.720> protection<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.860> snap<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
amount of protection for a snap on the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.760 
amount of protection for a snap on the
back<00:04:39.060> style<00:04:39.360> case<00:04:39.750> so<00:04:40.350> that's<00:04:40.500> pretty<00:04:40.650> much

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
back style case so that's pretty much

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.550 
back style case so that's pretty much
