00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
have nice bubble wrap that I will be

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.570 
have nice bubble wrap that I will be
sure<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> pop<00:00:25.859> later<00:00:27.680> all<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.890> let's<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
sure to pop later all right let's get in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.190 
sure to pop later all right let's get in
here<00:00:30.230> first<00:00:31.230> thing<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:33.110> and<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
here first thing I see is this and I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:56.080 
here first thing I see is this and I
actually<00:00:34.610> have<00:00:35.610> no<00:00:35.640> idea<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.840 

oh<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:58.550> what<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.850> is<00:01:00.520> okay<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:01.580> i<00:01:01.790> think

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
oh that's what it is okay so i think

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:12.110 
oh that's what it is okay so i think
that<00:01:02.240> this<00:01:02.540> is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.380 

I<00:01:14.600> think<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.690> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:19.340> five<00:01:20.340> milliliters<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
I think that this is five milliliters of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.900 
I think that this is five milliliters of
high<00:01:22.020> viscosity<00:01:22.440> Calvin<00:01:23.160> sleep<00:01:25.880> god<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
high viscosity Calvin sleep god I

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.160 
high viscosity Calvin sleep god I
ordered<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:28.250> all<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.400> next<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.240> this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
ordered that all right next up is this

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
ordered that all right next up is this
it<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:33.000> shelf<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.600> wife<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.850> version

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it is the same shelf or wife or version

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.260 
it is the same shelf or wife or version
25<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.600> believe<00:01:37.430> doesn't<00:01:38.430> sound<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.730> box<00:01:38.940> or<00:01:39.180> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
25 I believe doesn't sound the box or if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.220 
25 I believe doesn't sound the box or if
it<00:01:39.360> doesn't<00:01:39.660> can't<00:01:39.810> read<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.230> pop

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
it doesn't can't read it so just pop

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.670 
it doesn't can't read it so just pop
this<00:01:43.800> open

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.980 

give<00:01:48.280> me<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> nice<00:01:48.900> fold<00:01:49.900> out<00:01:50.140> probably<00:01:50.890> explain

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
give me a nice fold out probably explain

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.880 
give me a nice fold out probably explain
how<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.050> solve<00:01:53.410> it<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.890> way<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:58.300> here<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.500> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
how to solve it that way and here is the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.510 
how to solve it that way and here is the
puzzle<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.170> first<00:02:02.620> times<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:04.960> actually

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
puzzle so first times it is actually

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.999 
puzzle so first times it is actually
very<00:02:06.520> good<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.330> suspect<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.410> might<00:02:08.619> become

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
very good I suspect that I might become

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.180 
very good I suspect that I might become
you<00:02:09.070> need<00:02:09.990> because<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.590> actually<00:02:11.890> very

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
you need because it is actually very

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.090 
you need because it is actually very
very<00:02:12.850> smooth<00:02:13.360> right<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:19.560> double<00:02:20.560> layer<00:02:20.709> turns

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
very smooth right now double layer turns

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.630 
very smooth right now double layer turns
are<00:02:21.489> just<00:02:22.090> us<00:02:22.239> move<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.390> corner<00:02:28.390> cutting<00:02:28.660> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
are just us move the corner cutting is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.400 
are just us move the corner cutting is
suppose<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.880> decent<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.570> four<00:02:31.750> by<00:02:31.870> four

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.750 

now<00:02:35.410> one<00:02:35.680> thing<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.890> I'm<00:02:36.100> curious<00:02:36.370> about<00:02:36.550> is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
now one thing that I'm curious about is

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
now one thing that I'm curious about is
the<00:02:37.120> shank<00:02:37.450> shell<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.959> my<00:02:37.989> clothes<00:02:38.290> are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the shank shell for my clothes are

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
the shank shell for my clothes are
notorious<00:02:39.130> having<00:02:39.640> bad<00:02:40.050> center<00:02:41.050> layer<00:02:41.440> stones

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
notorious having bad center layer stones

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
notorious having bad center layer stones
so<00:02:43.209> we're<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.600> do<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.739> peel<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.190> parity

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
so we're going to do the peel of parity

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.610 
so we're going to do the peel of parity
Alvin<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.450> they<00:02:46.570> fix<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.380> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
Alvin and see if they fix that in the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.860 
Alvin and see if they fix that in the
version<00:02:48.070> 5<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:52.000> it's<00:02:52.180> not<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.660> i<00:02:52.780> was

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870
