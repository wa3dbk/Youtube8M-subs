00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 halli hello and welcome to the eleventh 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 follow the fifa 13 career mode with the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.510
 tottenham hotspurs and yes so slowly 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.400
 but of course it is of course now in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 the transfer phase and we become today 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.139
 also reach as far as this 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.060
 i remember 22 december we have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.090
 right now we are already on the 18th later 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.500
 are currently in fourth place with a chance 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 in fourth place 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.630
 so much forward 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 does not really seem to go like that anymore 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 it looks like that anyway 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 pretty tight everything in the middle front 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.760
 the night to chelsea and I believe it 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.260
 mancity the distance is a bit 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.480
 bigger, therefore, see what else there 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 Sun is definitely today partie 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 against stoke city the first two chances 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 against here will come to us then the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 first bitter bitter bitter message 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.710
 of the day 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.820
 we all see him in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 But in this case ours is not sitting there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 superstar gareth bale with one 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.180
 Sprained ankle had to leave the field 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 for him, the new team of Thomas enns 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.769
 the left side but this time it is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.659
 because with the ball in the middle is there 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.640
 jazz and rodrigues or chelsea for what 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 At some point we will learn 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.409
 and excited and he hits the header 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.299
 it does not go in that way either 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.299
 user 0 then holtby and you see 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 again in the middle the second 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.600
 injury in a game is natural 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.070
 very very bitter for him came mayuka the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 partie and this one should be 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.549
 Mutual prove very good 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.380
 just in mallorca the two 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.860
 substitutes for the two injured 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.630
 do together the 1 0 header of ins 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 mayuka with the wonderful graduation 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.130
 flat in the corner and so we go 1 0 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 in the lead and I had this time on 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 a beer instead of mayuka there 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 I think it is known while 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 Let's take a quick look at this mega dribbling 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.729
 Rodriguez look at the outside completely 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.259
 through and at the end is the post of 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.030
 prevents a nice goal from happening 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.469
 so i had put on roger because 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 well-known is that no team is 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.640
 which is pretty strong players at all 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.530
 So positions pretty much of the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 starch levels are heavy on the ball 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 disconnect and if I'm too small with it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.979
 players like Mallorca arrive I thought 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.019
 that could be me 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.519
 do not go out so well but it does have 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.140
 worked quite well and then it is 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.250
 actually the other substitute 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.349
 players in with the 2 0 in the 77 minute 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.239
 So perhaps you have from the beginning 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.760
 mayuka, on the other hand, employee too 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.860
 quite well worked out of everything 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 not all that wild at stoke 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 almost with the following goal 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.459
 Luckily luckily misses 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.260
 instead there is a park in real 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.150
 has a huge chance to leave 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.069
 against benfica lisbon will happen to be 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 has seen empty goals just shoot 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.720
 over three meters but good 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.660
 Majorca then still with the 3 1 means 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.579
 with the 13 0 double pack of mayuka the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.390
 has slowly really comes in the form 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.250
 her a bit of teething troubles 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.019
 and now how long does she lose 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.450
 long specials like long injured 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.760
 country-bay injured three weeks close well 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.440
 well that's halfway possible 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.609
 to cope with so long becomes him into the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.549
 For example, I think I'll replace it 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.190
 can and therefore not quite like that 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.840
 bad everything we do not think so yes 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.730
 not very wise how come 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.859
 in the next 4 I was not sure 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.090
 but I do not think so now 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.780
 In any case , I wear for a short time 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.790
 before 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.889
 then the party goes against aston villa 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.650
 we also take on 436 points 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.230
 chelsea and city ​​each with 45 44 one 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.660
 corresponding distance you have to say yes and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.040
 aston villa as did all these 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.319
 pretty far down I believe 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.180
 position 17 or 16 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.560
 and that's why I 'm actually relatively relative 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.299
 with good conscience in this lot 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 are used to stock especially 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.590
 I think I had a good run before 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.989
 but a wild one appeared 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.329
 to be pretty strong opponent and then 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.280
 even this dropping off of loris right in 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.109
 the legs and then comes to rhyme 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.150
 riemann I'm 17 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.380
 that corresponds in Weimar but out there 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.370
 I would say Austria because 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.690
 yes and seven others pretty much 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.250
 pretty strong team and i have 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.930
 really somehow mostly problems 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.579
 placed against this worse and one 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.030
 Grasp this dreamy header from 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.379
 Lectures wonderful become expensive 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.910
 every case as I said, I really 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.470
 problems against this placed below 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.959
 teams I'm better off against 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.329
 in my position then into 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.190
 lectures a no no no the 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.900
 million percent if you are so far 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.840
 ins must do it already and regis has to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.970
 I almost more 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.949
 this header but we have in 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.230
 lately is in top form and that is 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.440
 Emanuel I think it is Emanuel but 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 I'm not sure 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.810
 Well, yes is nonsense mayuka with the gate 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.760
 with his next goal in the next 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.650
 Game was really good at learning 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.690
 learn with the huge chance 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.600
 he does not hit the gate and so on 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.270
 it remains at 1 1 and we stop 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.470
 too many undecided if you like that 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.410
 as if we play at the very front 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.479
 we want to be able to do that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.479
 I turn off the whole feeling because 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.790
 honestly so many draws 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.080
 You can sit at the top up there 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.160
 Do not allow for the title 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 wants to play 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.620
 We will definitely be there 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.120
 talents how to right and easy sid 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.770
 they even drew against city 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.510
 that does not mean that played too 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.460
 underestimate we remember back 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.310
 the cup as we believe I have 32 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.660
 Just won against sunderland the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.880
 was definitely a pretty fierce one 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.710
 game and you see yourself already on five 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.090
 slipped because of the draw and 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.919
 should get in next time only once 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.190
 Do not allow much if possible 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.080
 is therefore first chance sandro 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.150
 here more clearly over than 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.130
 actually it is supposed then countries 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.530
 which penetrates the middle and yes there is 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.300
 that's enough yes I had with mac 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.760
 meter is also clear afterwards 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.349
 but unfortunately God wanted in the 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.330
 Chill will not grant us 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.400
 today love this eleven-meter free kick 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.800
 because world he is injured holtby 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.630
 there is not too much keeper gets so 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.610
 His arm was a nice goal 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.090
 and also the second or third 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.849
 already in this in this career with 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.620
 today with us was never who both fsv 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.020
 Career if you are ours 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.330
 sensational free-kick shooters also there three 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.520
 four beautiful things made helping each 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.900
 We are so forgiving this time today 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.789
 Definitely a great opportunity after the 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.570
 others and his lent laughs himself into it 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.700
 Fäustchen 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.099
 According to the motto we only need one 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.400
 single counter and then you have here 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.440
 the salad with us and this could already 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.300
 that's exactly what she was like 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.550
 awarded to luck then is rodrigo 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.919
 one with a start and now takes 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.960
 the very strong start looks in the 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.000
 middle when she sees no one 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.039
 but do it yourself and fail 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.680
 back to keeper too bad a pity 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.199
 against 1 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.060
 and so we are the 62 minute yet 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.500
 once he pulls rodrigo on the outside again he pulls 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.009
 he is actually all that fast 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.320
 not at all 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.750
 the one we rented sprints 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.460
 after Rodrigo fails and the 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.830
 not get in the middle again with the ball 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.880
 it pointed to everything again 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.130
 undecided 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.960
 and that was really anything but 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.240
 my plan of this lot then comes the 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.120
 In addition, select ball after pass from rodrigo 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.830
 and the man saves us again 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.340
 do not give up many gates but have to 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.930
 many tell many important goals 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.460
 mayuka just came in because 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.590
 He also had that strong run 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.570
 fredericks our youngest youngster out 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.570
 own rows fredericks and 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.610
 actually the 2 0 after this class 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.479
 pass from the outside you have to say like to know 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.190
 of the actually but came on everyone 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.750
 case very very strong and also 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.880
 the conclusion with left one 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.199
 weaker foot of course everything else 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.729
 as bad learn it again 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.530
 finds in the middle mayuka who wants 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.759
 make his next goal and behind 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.940
 come completely no longer turn 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.530
 it stays that way even when we are 2 0 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.090
 win at least once again a game 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.560
 After all, what does it mean after all? 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.080
 no lost the last time 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.460
 which is not too bad yes 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.560
 Unfortunately, that's just fine with God 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.060
 back to the end of the episode and 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.889
 Of course I would like one 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.949
 appreciation of you just look forward to 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:48.000
 show that they still like poverty 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:49.500
 and so on 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 it got me on the next video video it 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.000
