meter<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.800> most<00:01:26.250> compressors<00:01:26.880> don't

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
meter because most compressors don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.950 
meter because most compressors don't
even<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.730> they're<00:01:29.910> great<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.480> don't<00:01:30.660> have

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
their what the gain reduction actually

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
their what the gain reduction actually
kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> looks<00:01:35.730> like<00:01:35.850> where<00:01:36.270> where<00:01:36.660> it<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
kind of looks like where where it is in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.850 
kind of looks like where where it is in
terms<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.100> DV<00:01:38.460> meter<00:01:38.760> which<00:01:39.620> sometimes<00:01:40.620> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
terms of the DV meter which sometimes is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.720 
terms of the DV meter which sometimes is
helpful<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.070> well-made<00:01:44.430> pedal
