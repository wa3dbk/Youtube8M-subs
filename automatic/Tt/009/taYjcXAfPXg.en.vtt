00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.100
 well I'm encouragement will be worth it to do it 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.049
 groening madero what is an achievement of 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.340
 exploration of padaria of course 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.780
 does on this continent in the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.429
 pandaria in the area of ​​the island 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.780
 timeless that is in the part 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.910
 from below to the right to the forest of jade 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.220
 to get to islands we can simply 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.680
 go flying if we had caught the god 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.750
 from the point of flight with the point of flight 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.539
 the goal of achievement is to solve the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 enigma of rolo on the island this is taken out 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.769
 making a chain of three missions that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.770
 it is started by an object called the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.330
 gold enigma 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.990
 what of the riddle of error or am I going to 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.790
 repeat a lot so accustomed 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.590
 to get this object what there is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.810
 what to do is take a lot of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.420
 scintillating sand that every time what 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.970
 we take have a chance to give us 5 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 the object starts the mission the arena 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.040
 twinkle is mainly found 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.930
 on the west coast of the island that in the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.060
 red area that is painted and on the map by 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 the ground we go out there we see a 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.680
 little bit of sand we open it and always 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.370
 gives us some timeless coins of those 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.280
 and you can give us the mission object to me 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.910
 It took me about 25 minutes and that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.610
 me to kill networks boats of all no longer 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.320
 It costs a lot with a tad of luck to 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.540
 once we have the emission object 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 as he has already taken it there and we learn it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.310
 will give us a first quest that will be 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.190
 find the first clue the first 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 track is at the red dot that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.070
 this one I'm putting there are the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.930
 coordinates 49.49 69 point 20 that is a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.160
 big pile of sand we will leave the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.030
 white question mark and when we 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.250
 let's get closer to him 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.190
 is to find the first clue and be the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.369
 we deliver to the same pile of sand that 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.720
 heap of sand will give us a mission that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.690
 it goes against the second track that is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.070
 the other pile of sand this second with 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.740
 a lot of sand is in this other 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.729
 red dot which are the coordinates 34 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 points 66 26.51 that they themselves 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.229
 we approach and complete the mission and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.659
 will ask us since we found the treasure 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.939
 that was the third last mission 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.140
 this is the complicated thing that only 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.519
 find in a place you can only go 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.920
 flying and on the island you can not fly 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.260
 There are two ways but I'm going to explain 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.230
 those who do not ask us for any requirement or 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260
 help us or anything 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.390
 sometimes it's going to the center of the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 island to the arena where the voices are and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.659
 if we look through the sky we will see some 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.250
 Seagulls like this one that I am 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.100
 teaching now that he's flying around 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.560
 there will be times that you will go down to the ground 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.810
 when it is more or less close to the ground 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.600
 we will go behind her as close as 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 we can try to hit him with any 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.940
 remote skill while we jump 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.680
 when we jump we have to hit him 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.090
 we are on the ground it will not work 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.820
 you have to go jumping all the time and giving 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.490
 life all the time until you 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.680
 then do low damage Seagull 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.810
 picks us up and takes us for a walk 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.120
 for the island in the seagull we do not have to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.860
 hit him until we get to the point that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 we want it to be the red dot that 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.239
 I'm putting on the map that is the lake 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.390
 of ruby which is the red spot of 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.430
 there and once we get there 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.560
 that we are on top of the lake that is water 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.860
 we started hitting him when we started 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.620
 hitting the seagull will stop 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.120
 and when we kill her she will let us fall 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.190
 that's important to be on top of the water 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.560
 the water knows to be we do not kill ourselves 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.090
 it is important once in the water we have 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.700
 to climb up to the tree that was the 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.520
 red dot which are the coordinates 65 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 points 91 23.01 unless it is where 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.710
 is the treasure we deliver the mission 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.410
 we choose the reward and he will give us the 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.410
 achievement and we will have the error riddle 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.790
 an important thing from here you can 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.630
 go down to Ordos area which is where only 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.270
 they can enter people with the layer 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.830
 legendary in case you want to make the achievement 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.380
 of temporary inn nutrition you will have to 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.770
 come like this although there are more ways to 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.620
 catch him 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.360
 the hot poppy but if not 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.090
 did you know how to make the achievement of the video 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.090
 serve or like and tomorrow more until tomorrow
