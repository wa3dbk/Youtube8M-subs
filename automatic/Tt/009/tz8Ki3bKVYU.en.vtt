00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.050

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:07.510
 brave afternoon and 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.320
 let's change the protector of 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.300
 plastic screen towards me and my 1s 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.000
 let's put on the tempered glass that 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.790
 good 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.590
 you have already seen the unboxing by 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.130
 true this 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.740
 videos review I'm recording it from the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.820
 m3 armchair so tell me how about going 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.619
 Sound quality sound on everything and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.870
 video quality if it's better to follow me 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.060
 I'll go a thousand 91 but I'll see it too but 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.630
 I want to know your opinion to see what 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.170
 as you see it and it is about that 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.730
 the box of the Yankees also have 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.110
 own life 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.410
 first of all I'm going to take away the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.580
 siam and remy 9c screen protector 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.980
 and I 'm going to make a small room 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.780
 because I am very useful with this and now we 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 we see you do not go 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.829
 Well , it takes away the protector of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.369
 plastic to the sion 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.100
 efe as you can see here is here and we are going to 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.760
 proceed with the maneuver 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.760
 have patience 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.580
 let's clean it, let it go , I'll invite you 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.310
 although I loved myself very clean no variety 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.329
 I'm seeing a lot of speck and that's not 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.329
 I do not like 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:42.590
 more or less 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.590
 more less than more but let's see proceed 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.350
 have more money than your pretty 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.930
 special with this shit I said shit 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 I 've said it again but that 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 youtube do not censor me good depends on 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.020
 how do I get this or what's included in the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.130
 video do not include it so if I'm in 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.180
 silence is that they are required to come 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.180
 better not in English 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 well it has not been so bad since 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.450
 not that I have not botched 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.820
 I included the part where I was 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.850
 placing the tempered glass as he 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.330
 yes to me repression and three I do not know why 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.030
 but the video has recorded it out of focus 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.400
 so I do not know if it will be worth it or if 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 it's worth it I put new content 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.890
 classified and then you can see the box 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.700
 a while and it's already but that's good 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.410
 you can see then 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.209
 It is quite a change considerably better if 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.550
 we compare it with the typical plastic 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.000
 protector and also the screen goes a lot 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.670
 better the touch goes a hundred thousand times better 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.670
 the curious fact is that cabbage 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.920
 the area of the light sensor and others 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.680
 when we do not hit it to ear when 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.930
 we are calling for example or close 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.590
 the cover that if you have a fonda type 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.129
 book is not protected thing that I 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.810
 it said a train came symptom sane bad yes 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.819
 that I protected her I do not know because they have 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.200
 done like that but good 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.939
 and things that they have now to catch one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.700
 permanent and such and we believe that it is lawful 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.849
 nothing to catch hammer crush the 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.480
 xiaomi rms and good come now we do not see 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.480
 tendons 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.430
 I do not know if it's me or the yes to me test me 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.100
 is recorded records worse I do not know I did not have 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.780
 to record better and if I have the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.690
 activity image stabilizer 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.980
 for good listillos 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.770
 As you can see, this is the typical 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.590
 product to clean screens 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.220
 permanent and how this is going to be a test 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.040
 very light if what you want to say then 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.430
 I'll leave here more or less 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.819
 the test of colonel fap lad kid 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.849
 boy has little is German I think so 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.109
 except that seems and is a little animal 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.440
 like good animal like good german forgiveness 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.180
 and it makes some pretty beast tests I do not 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.880
 I'm going to do that you beasts because 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.880
 I do not want to theoretically protect it from 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.979
 scratches bumps but I will not take a 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.360
 hammer here and crush the lord 2009 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.390
 because not because it costs money and because 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.790
 you know 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.760
 I do not have no paper, but one 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.340

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.610
 try first to put permanent already 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.270
 you know the typical permanent I saw that already 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.640
 you could see in the test of the day 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.640
 one minute and well let's give it 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:06.640
 as you can see 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:10.360
 from pela he fought spits or come to 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.840
 say the permanent focus and 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.840
 focus 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.039
 I did not notice that there as you can see what 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.099
 spits and spits like 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:26.699
 permanent spits water or in this case 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.699

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.150

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.920

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.710

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:55.719

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.860
 at one a test to hardcore like 40 os 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.259
 I leave here 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.110
 your YouTube channel more than your channel 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.960

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.780

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.909
 do really with these crystals 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.180

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.370
 you do not have the pasta left over ok 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.020

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.879
 do it but I'm not going to play the guy 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.360
