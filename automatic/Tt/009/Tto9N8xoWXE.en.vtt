eight sets of Z spheres on top of the
original<00:00:24.070> one<00:00:24.220> that<00:00:24.250> we<00:00:24.490> drew<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:25.720> can<00:00:25.900> click

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
original one that we drew we can click

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.239 
original one that we drew we can click
move<00:00:26.349> to<00:00:26.589> adjust<00:00:26.890> those<00:00:27.099> slightly<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:30.220> then

move to adjust those slightly and then

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.249 
move to adjust those slightly and then
again<00:00:30.999> we'll<00:00:31.150> draw<00:00:31.359> another<00:00:31.720> set<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.110> these

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
again we'll draw another set of these

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.960 
again we'll draw another set of these
fears<00:00:32.500> on<00:00:32.680> top<00:00:32.890> of<00:00:33.040> those<00:00:33.190> eight<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.760> then

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
fears on top of those eight and then

fears on top of those eight and then
again<00:00:34.450> click<00:00:34.750> move<00:00:34.990> to<00:00:35.260> pull<00:00:35.440> those<00:00:35.620> out<00:00:35.800> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
again click move to pull those out so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.510 
again click move to pull those out so
we'll<00:00:37.899> repeat<00:00:38.289> this<00:00:38.469> process<00:00:38.680> one<00:00:39.129> more<00:00:39.309> time

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
we'll repeat this process one more time

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.700 
we'll repeat this process one more time
by<00:00:39.730> drawing<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.239> eight<00:00:40.420> Morsy<00:00:40.809> spheres<00:00:41.110> will

by drawing in eight Morsy spheres will

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.740 
by drawing in eight Morsy spheres will
use<00:00:41.920> move<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.460> pull<00:00:42.640> them<00:00:42.789> out<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:42.940> then<00:00:43.660> we

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
use move to pull them out and then we

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.389 
use move to pull them out and then we
can<00:00:43.870> switch<00:00:44.109> over<00:00:44.289> to<00:00:44.320> scale<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.770> scale<00:00:45.370> down

so<00:01:10.750> at<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:10.960> point<00:01:11.200> Simon's<00:01:11.710> kind<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.040> just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
so at this point Simon's kind of just

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.790 
so at this point Simon's kind of just
adjusting<00:01:12.820> these<00:01:13.300> tentacles<00:01:13.660> and<00:01:14.080> moving

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
adjusting these tentacles and moving

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.650 
adjusting these tentacles and moving
them<00:01:14.920> around<00:01:15.070> scaling<00:01:15.910> them<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.300> get<00:01:16.480> the

them around scaling them to get the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.050 
them around scaling them to get the
exact<00:01:17.050> shape<00:01:17.320> that<00:01:17.530> he<00:01:17.650> wants<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.580> don't

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
exact shape that he wants so don't

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.030 
exact shape that he wants so don't
hesitate<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.690> be<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> little<00:01:19.990> experimental<00:01:20.680> and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
hesitate to be a little experimental and

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.440 
hesitate to be a little experimental and
see<00:01:21.280> what<00:01:21.460> shapes<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.790> can<00:01:21.910> come<00:01:22.120> up<00:01:22.240> with

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
see what shapes you can come up with

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.940 
see what shapes you can come up with
when<00:01:23.050> you're<00:01:23.140> happy<00:01:23.350> with<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> head<00:01:23.830> and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
when you're happy with the head and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.950 
when you're happy with the head and
tentacles<00:01:24.130> he'll<00:01:24.970> draw<00:01:25.150> another<00:01:25.390> Z<00:01:25.660> sphere

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
tentacles he'll draw another Z sphere

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.500 
tentacles he'll draw another Z sphere
here<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> bottom<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.910> neck<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.480> the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
here on the bottom to be the neck of the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.770 
here on the bottom to be the neck of the
character<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.460> we'll<00:01:30.970> draw<00:01:31.180> another<00:01:31.510> Z

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
character and then we'll draw another Z

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780 
character and then we'll draw another Z
sphere<00:01:32.050> on<00:01:32.200> top<00:01:32.230> of<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.680> neck<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.370> easier

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
sphere on top of that neck is easier

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.370 
sphere on top of that neck is easier
that<00:01:33.910> we<00:01:34.000> created<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.600> we<00:01:34.810> can<00:01:34.960> pull<00:01:35.140> out

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
that we created so that we can pull out

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.010 
that we created so that we can pull out
the<00:01:35.800> torso<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.520> then<00:01:36.970> we'll<00:01:37.090> use<00:01:37.330> move<00:01:37.660> just

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the torso and then we'll use move just

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.640 
the torso and then we'll use move just
to<00:01:38.110> pull<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.380> straight<00:01:38.650> down<00:01:40.230> we<00:01:41.230> can<00:01:41.380> scale

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
to pull that straight down we can scale

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.470 
to pull that straight down we can scale
that<00:01:41.800> up<00:01:41.860> at<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.160> bottom<00:01:42.490> give<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> torso<00:01:43.450> a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
that up at the bottom give the torso a

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.930 
that up at the bottom give the torso a
little<00:01:43.840> bit<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.020> thickness<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.730> then<00:01:45.730> we'll

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
little bit of thickness and then we'll

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.820 
little bit of thickness and then we'll
draw<00:01:46.120> in<00:01:46.330> another<00:01:46.660> Z<00:01:46.930> sphere<00:01:47.260> kind<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.710> at<00:01:47.800> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
draw in another Z sphere kind of at the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.980 
draw in another Z sphere kind of at the
base<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.430> neck<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.480> at<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.720> point

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
base of the neck so at this point

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.720 
base of the neck so at this point
Simon's<00:01:50.440> going<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.620> create<00:01:50.890> some<00:01:51.100> arms<00:01:51.460> you'll

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
Simon's going to create some arms you'll

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.450 
Simon's going to create some arms you'll
use<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.300> z<00:01:52.540> axis<00:01:52.570> for<00:01:53.530> symmetry<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:54.070> time<00:01:54.280> so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
use the z axis for symmetry this time so

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.340 
use the z axis for symmetry this time so
you<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.580> get<00:01:54.790> two<00:01:54.970> symmetrical<00:01:55.510> arms<00:01:55.750> you'll

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
you can get two symmetrical arms you'll

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.350 
you can get two symmetrical arms you'll
draw<00:01:56.620> in<00:01:56.830> two<00:01:57.160> Z's<00:01:57.400> fears<00:01:57.670> for<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:57.970> shoulders

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
draw in two Z's fears for the shoulders

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.780 
draw in two Z's fears for the shoulders
and<00:01:58.600> then<00:01:59.140> two<00:01:59.500> more<00:01:59.740> for<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.100> arms<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.640> then

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
and then two more for the arms and then

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.050 
and then two more for the arms and then
use<00:02:00.970> move<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:01.540> pull<00:02:01.690> those<00:02:01.870> out<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.760> adjust

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
use move to pull those out we can adjust

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.940 
use move to pull those out we can adjust
the<00:02:04.180> shoulders<00:02:04.600> adjust<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.230> arms<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:05.800> then

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
the shoulders adjust the arms and then

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.160 
the shoulders adjust the arms and then
use<00:02:06.220> draw<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.760> draw<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.030> another<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.570> easier<00:02:08.020> to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
use draw to draw in another is easier to

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.719 
use draw to draw in another is easier to
create<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.500> elbows

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
create the elbows

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.059 
create the elbows
so<00:02:11.450> at<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:11.629> point<00:02:11.930> Simon<00:02:12.409> will<00:02:12.530> open<00:02:12.800> up<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
so at this point Simon will open up the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.979 
so at this point Simon will open up the
adaptive<00:02:13.580> skin<00:02:13.849> pull<00:02:14.090> down<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.810> tool

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
adaptive skin pull down in the tool

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.320 
adaptive skin pull down in the tool
palette<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.560> increase<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.549> density<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:17.239> a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
palette and increase the density just a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.240 
palette and increase the density just a
little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.659> to<00:02:17.840> give<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.349> preview<00:02:18.950> match<00:02:19.099> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
little bit to give the preview match a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.399 
little bit to give the preview match a
little<00:02:19.610> bit<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:19.849> density<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.390> work<00:02:20.569> with<00:02:20.810> he

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
little bit more density to work with he

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.619 
little bit more density to work with he
will<00:02:21.530> also<00:02:21.920> add<00:02:22.129> in<00:02:22.370> additional<00:02:22.580> Z<00:02:23.120> spheres<00:02:23.420> in

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
will also add in additional Z spheres in

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.240 
will also add in additional Z spheres in
some<00:02:23.840> areas<00:02:24.200> where<00:02:24.409> he<00:02:24.440> wants<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.769> tighten<00:02:25.159> up

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
some areas where he wants to tighten up

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.690 
some areas where he wants to tighten up
the<00:02:25.400> mesh<00:02:26.620> adding<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.739> additional<00:02:27.920> Z<00:02:28.459> series

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the mesh adding in additional Z series

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.400 
the mesh adding in additional Z series
will<00:02:28.970> make<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.269> mesh<00:02:29.420> conform<00:02:29.900> more<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
will make the mesh conform more to the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.350 
will make the mesh conform more to the
shape<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.860> see<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.549> Z's<00:02:31.790> fear<00:02:32.000> model

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
shape that you see in the Z's fear model

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.390 
shape that you see in the Z's fear model
so<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.080> instance<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.530> notice<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> arm<00:02:34.129> area

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so for instance you notice the arm area

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.460 
so for instance you notice the arm area
here<00:02:34.879> is<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.269> little<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.660> soft<00:02:35.989> under<00:02:36.379> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
here is a little bit soft under the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.740 
here is a little bit soft under the
armpits<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.549> you'll<00:02:37.700> do<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.180> add<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> Z

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
armpits so what you'll do is add a Z

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.910 
armpits so what you'll do is add a Z
sphere<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.530> chest<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:41.530> then<00:02:42.530> again<00:02:42.769> to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
sphere in on the chest and then again to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.830 
sphere in on the chest and then again to
tighten<00:02:43.220> up<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.430> shoulders<00:02:43.879> he'll<00:02:44.450> add<00:02:44.660> in

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
tighten up the shoulders he'll add in

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380 
tighten up the shoulders he'll add in
two<00:02:45.019> more<00:02:45.170> Z's<00:02:45.410> fears<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.920> sides<00:02:46.129> there<00:02:46.400> we

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
two more Z's fears on the sides there we

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.819 
two more Z's fears on the sides there we
can<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:47.660> use<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.019> Move<00:02:48.230> tool<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.709> adjust

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
can then use the Move tool to adjust

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.910 
can then use the Move tool to adjust
that<00:02:52.629> so<00:02:53.629> now<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.959> Simon's<00:02:54.379> done<00:02:54.590> building

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
that so now that Simon's done building

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.160 
that so now that Simon's done building
the<00:02:55.160> basic<00:02:55.519> shape<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.209> character<00:02:56.660> he'll

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the basic shape of the character he'll

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.080 
the basic shape of the character he'll
turn<00:02:57.349> off<00:02:57.530> symmetry<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.250> work<00:02:58.549> on<00:02:58.730> one<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
turn off symmetry and work on one of the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.849 
turn off symmetry and work on one of the
arms<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.079> where<00:03:00.260> he's<00:03:00.379> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.560> build

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
arms this is where he's going to build

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.979 
arms this is where he's going to build
kind<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.400> thick<00:03:01.700> cloth<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.569> character

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
kind of a thick cloth for the character

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.470 
kind of a thick cloth for the character
and<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.200> process<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.069> exactly<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.879> same<00:03:05.120> as

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
and the process is exactly the same as

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.360 
and the process is exactly the same as
we've<00:03:05.810> done<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:06.230> far<00:03:06.260> he'll<00:03:06.739> draw<00:03:06.980> in<00:03:07.099> a<00:03:07.190> few

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
we've done so far he'll draw in a few

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.610 
we've done so far he'll draw in a few
Z's<00:03:07.579> fears<00:03:07.819> use<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.780> Move<00:03:08.959> tool<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.379> kind<00:03:09.530> of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
Z's fears use the Move tool to kind of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.380 
Z's fears use the Move tool to kind of
pull<00:03:09.829> them<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.160> adjust<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.849> then

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
pull them out and adjust and then

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.300 
pull them out and adjust and then
preview<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.260> mesh<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.650> kind<00:03:12.829> of<00:03:12.859> see<00:03:13.069> how

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
preview the mesh to kind of see how

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.479 
preview the mesh to kind of see how
everything's<00:03:13.730> looking<00:03:15.069> do<00:03:16.069> a<00:03:16.099> little<00:03:16.340> bit

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
everything's looking do a little bit

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.460 
everything's looking do a little bit
more<00:03:16.669> adjusting<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.540> adding<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.019> these<00:03:18.200> fears

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
more adjusting and adding of these fears

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.900 
more adjusting and adding of these fears
to<00:03:18.709> tighten<00:03:19.040> up<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.250> mesh<00:03:19.430> in<00:03:19.579> some<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.849> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to tighten up the mesh in some of the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.400 
to tighten up the mesh in some of the
areas<00:03:19.940> just<00:03:20.419> to<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> claw<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.109> look<00:03:21.319> a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
areas just to get the claw to look a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.930 
areas just to get the claw to look a
little<00:03:21.500> bit<00:03:21.709> more<00:03:21.919> like<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> claw<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.760> can

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
little bit more like a claw and you can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.699 
little bit more like a claw and you can
see<00:03:26.120> when<00:03:26.299> he<00:03:26.389> added<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.780> those<00:03:26.989> two<00:03:27.230> little<00:03:27.410> Z

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
see when he added in those two little Z

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.289 
see when he added in those two little Z
spheres<00:03:28.010> there<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.459> got<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.639> much<00:03:28.880> tighter

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
spheres there you got a much tighter

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.699 
spheres there you got a much tighter
mesh<00:03:29.690> around<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.950> intersection<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:32.709> little

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
mesh around that intersection a little

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.379 
mesh around that intersection a little
bit<00:03:33.799> of<00:03:33.889> scaling<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.549> get<00:03:34.669> the<00:03:34.790> size<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.030> he's

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
bit of scaling to get the size that he's

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.789 
bit of scaling to get the size that he's
looking<00:03:35.660> for<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.139> again<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.349> little<00:03:36.530> bit<00:03:36.650> of

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
looking for and again a little bit of

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.120 
looking for and again a little bit of
move<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.430> adjust<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.450> shape<00:03:38.829> now<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.889> might

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
move to adjust the shape now you might

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.280 
move to adjust the shape now you might
notice<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.489> when<00:03:40.849> Simon<00:03:41.359> previews<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:42.019> mesh

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
notice that when Simon previews is mesh

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.229 
notice that when Simon previews is mesh
you<00:03:42.709> see<00:03:42.950> different<00:03:43.400> passions<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.910> colors

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
you see different passions of colors

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.030 
you see different passions of colors
around<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.720> preview<00:03:45.079> mesh<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.889> is

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
around the preview mesh and this is

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.650 
around the preview mesh and this is
because<00:03:46.310> he<00:03:46.430> has<00:03:46.519> frame<00:03:46.880> turned<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.389> which

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
because he has frame turned on which

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.300 
because he has frame turned on which
will<00:03:47.840> show<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.169> different<00:03:48.500> polygroups<00:03:49.010> that

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
will show the different polygroups that

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.750 
will show the different polygroups that
disease<00:03:49.639> fears<00:03:49.910> are<00:03:50.090> creating<00:03:51.310> at<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.489> point

he'll adjust the tentacles a little bit

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.229 
he'll adjust the tentacles a little bit
and<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.099> notice<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.519> he<00:03:55.609> switches<00:03:55.940> back<00:03:56.180> and

here's Simon's going to start working on
the<00:04:22.800> other<00:04:22.949> hand<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.520> you'll<00:04:23.910> do<00:04:24.090> something<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
the other hand and you'll do something a

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.760 
the other hand and you'll do something a
bit<00:04:24.600> different<00:04:24.660> than<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.229> claw<00:04:25.440> he'll

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
bit different than the claw he'll

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.379 
bit different than the claw he'll
actually<00:04:25.949> create<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> few<00:04:26.669> digits<00:04:26.850> here<00:04:27.210> and

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
actually create a few digits here and

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.080 
actually create a few digits here and
create<00:04:28.350> kind<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.680> tentacle<00:04:29.250> looking<00:04:29.789> hand

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
create kind of a tentacle looking hand

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.779 
create kind of a tentacle looking hand

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
for his character now as you're working

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.159 
for his character now as you're working
on<00:04:32.850> Z<00:04:33.090> spheres<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.509> want<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.840> keep<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.139> mind

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
on Z spheres I want you to keep in mind

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.719 
on Z spheres I want you to keep in mind
that<00:04:34.560> these<00:04:34.800> fears<00:04:35.070> are<00:04:35.220> kind<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.550> like

that these fears are kind of like

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.420 
that these fears are kind of like
working<00:04:36.270> on<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.810> wire<00:04:37.410> armature<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:38.340> you

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
working on a wire armature that you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.850 
working on a wire armature that you
would<00:04:38.550> use<00:04:38.759> maybe<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.240> clay<00:04:39.599> figure<00:04:40.259> sculpt<00:04:40.680> and

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
would use maybe a clay figure sculpt and

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
would use maybe a clay figure sculpt and
what<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.639> want<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.849> do<00:04:42.000> is<00:04:42.120> basically<00:04:42.389> create

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
what you want to do is basically create

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.409 
what you want to do is basically create
your<00:04:43.139> base<00:04:43.530> structure<00:04:44.310> you're<00:04:44.910> not<00:04:45.030> trying<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
your base structure you're not trying to

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.930 
your base structure you're not trying to
create<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.259> exact<00:04:46.710> form<00:04:47.130> in<00:04:47.370> shape<00:04:47.639> at<00:04:47.789> this

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
create the exact form in shape at this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.670 
create the exact form in shape at this
point<00:04:48.270> that's<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.720> we'll<00:04:48.900> use<00:04:49.110> all<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.470> more

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
point that's what we'll use all the more

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.499 
point that's what we'll use all the more
advanced<00:04:49.949> sculpting<00:04:50.460> tools<00:04:50.669> inside<00:04:51.060> zbrush<00:04:51.479> 4

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
advanced sculpting tools inside zbrush 4

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.290 
advanced sculpting tools inside zbrush 4
but<00:04:52.229> here<00:04:52.500> we'll<00:04:52.650> use<00:04:52.889> Z<00:04:53.340> spheres<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.880> quickly

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
but here we'll use Z spheres to quickly

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.360 
but here we'll use Z spheres to quickly
and<00:04:54.509> cleanly<00:04:54.840> create<00:04:55.500> kind<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.099> shape

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
and cleanly create kind of the shape

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.189 
and cleanly create kind of the shape
that<00:04:56.400> we're<00:04:56.669> going<00:04:56.759> to<00:04:56.849> be<00:04:56.940> sculpting<00:04:57.389> on<00:04:57.509> so

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
that we're going to be sculpting on so

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.930 
that we're going to be sculpting on so
you'll<00:04:58.380> notice<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.680> Simon<00:04:59.190> creates<00:04:59.490> couple

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
you'll notice that Simon creates couple

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.580 
you'll notice that Simon creates couple
z's<00:05:00.150> fears<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.750> hands<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.259> then<00:05:01.410> you'll

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
z's fears for the hands and then you'll

to<00:05:42.330> be<00:05:42.449> doing<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.810> exact<00:05:43.320> same<00:05:43.440> techniques

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
to be doing the exact same techniques

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.129 
to be doing the exact same techniques
that<00:05:44.280> we've<00:05:44.430> done<00:05:44.669> up<00:05:44.880> until<00:05:45.090> now<00:05:45.300> which<00:05:46.110> is

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
that we've done up until now which is

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.620 
that we've done up until now which is
drawing<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:46.949> Z<00:05:47.190> spheres<00:05:47.550> adjusting<00:05:48.509> their

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
drawing in Z spheres adjusting their

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.360 
drawing in Z spheres adjusting their
position<00:05:49.080> with<00:05:49.259> move<00:05:49.500> maybe<00:05:49.919> doing<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:50.340> little

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
position with move maybe doing a little

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.249 
position with move maybe doing a little
bit<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.639> scaling<00:05:51.150> so<00:05:51.630> we'll<00:05:51.900> go<00:05:52.020> ahead<00:05:52.139> and

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
bit of scaling so we'll go ahead and

00:05:52.259 --> 00:06:01.519 
bit of scaling so we'll go ahead and
speed<00:05:52.620> things<00:05:52.860> up<00:05:53.009> a<00:05:53.130> little<00:05:53.280> bit<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.669> move<00:05:53.909> on

basically<00:06:08.340> all<00:06:08.520> Simon's<00:06:08.970> doing<00:06:09.300> is<00:06:09.420> using

basically all Simon's doing is using

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.050 
basically all Simon's doing is using
move<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.350> adjust<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.830> tentacles<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.670> fit<00:06:11.880> them

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
move to adjust the tentacles to fit them

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.270 
move to adjust the tentacles to fit them
more<00:06:12.270> around<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.630> body<00:06:13.130> occasionally<00:06:14.130> who

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
more around the body occasionally who

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.250 
more around the body occasionally who
use<00:06:14.580> draw<00:06:14.910> to<00:06:14.970> grow<00:06:15.300> in<00:06:15.480> another<00:06:15.750> Z<00:06:15.990> sphere

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
use draw to grow in another Z sphere

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.200 
use draw to grow in another Z sphere
somewhere<00:06:16.710> along<00:06:16.890> the<00:06:17.070> chain<00:06:17.100> so<00:06:17.880> that<00:06:17.910> he<00:06:18.060> can

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
somewhere along the chain so that he can

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.640 
somewhere along the chain so that he can
get<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.360> little<00:06:18.510> bit<00:06:18.690> more<00:06:18.870> Bend<00:06:19.170> along<00:06:19.470> that

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
get a little bit more Bend along that

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.750 
get a little bit more Bend along that
tentacle<00:06:21.950> here<00:06:22.950> in<00:06:23.070> the<00:06:23.160> back<00:06:23.280> of<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.580> head

he'll<00:06:24.000> draw<00:06:24.210> in<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.450> few<00:06:24.630> more<00:06:24.750> z's<00:06:24.810> fears<00:06:25.290> and

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
he'll draw in a few more z's fears and

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.810 
he'll draw in a few more z's fears and
position<00:06:25.920> them<00:06:26.100> so<00:06:26.250> that<00:06:26.280> we<00:06:26.490> can<00:06:26.640> get<00:06:26.790> a

couple more tentacles other than our
original<00:06:28.770> eight<00:06:29.280> of<00:06:29.490> course<00:06:30.150> you'll<00:06:30.360> pose

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
original eight of course you'll pose

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.480 
original eight of course you'll pose
them<00:06:31.200> just<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.500> same<00:06:31.530> way<00:06:31.860> he<00:06:32.010> did<00:06:32.160> with<00:06:32.310> other

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
them just the same way he did with other

them just the same way he did with other
ones
