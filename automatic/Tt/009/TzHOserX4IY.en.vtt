00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 fired and now is the moral on the ground 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 ok it may seem so but that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.009
 layoff was the best thing 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.170

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:21.110
 exciting but it's a little wait 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.910
