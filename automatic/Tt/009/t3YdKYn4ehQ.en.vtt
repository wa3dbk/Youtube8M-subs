the<00:02:43.080> best<00:02:43.230> way<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.470> describe<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.910> once<00:02:45.090> you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
the best way to describe it but once you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.490 
the best way to describe it but once you
feel<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.510> blend<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:45.960> your<00:02:46.080> finger

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
and let it kind of settle it looks

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.270 
and let it kind of settle it looks
really<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:49.080> pretty<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:49.680> i<00:02:49.710> got<00:02:49.890> one<00:02:50.160> of
