would have to use all the items in your
inventory<00:01:47.849> that<00:01:48.209> actually<00:01:48.539> can<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.780> damage

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
such as the brick as well as the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.929 
such as the brick as well as the
crowbars<00:01:51.390> however<00:01:52.379> another<00:01:53.069> strategy<00:01:53.489> is<00:01:53.849> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
crowbars however another strategy is to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.740 
crowbars however another strategy is to
use<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.629> punch<00:01:55.079> combo<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.789> Judas<00:01:57.119> punch<00:01:57.360> combo

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
use a punch combo the Judas punch combo

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
use a punch combo the Judas punch combo
you<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> press<00:01:58.349> the<00:01:58.560> punch<00:01:58.799> button<00:01:59.129> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you have to press the punch button in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
you have to press the punch button in
the<00:01:59.459> right<00:01:59.670> rhythm<00:01:59.879> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.539> you<00:02:00.750> charge<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the right rhythm so that you charge it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.399 
the right rhythm so that you charge it
while<00:02:01.770> also<00:02:02.039> continuing<00:02:02.849> the<00:02:03.000> punch<00:02:03.409> getting

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
while also continuing the punch getting

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.020 
while also continuing the punch getting
this<00:02:04.500> rhythm<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.759> bit

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this rhythm down can take a little bit

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.669 
this rhythm down can take a little bit
and<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.539> may<00:02:06.659> end<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.899> taking<00:02:07.110> some<00:02:07.439> damage

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
and you may end up taking some damage

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.710 
and you may end up taking some damage
from<00:02:08.009> judge<00:02:08.220> doom<00:02:08.459> anyway<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
from judge doom anyway but this is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
from judge doom anyway but this is
probably<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.140> best<00:02:10.410> strategy<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.039> order<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
probably the best strategy in order to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:26.040 
probably the best strategy in order to
actually<00:02:11.549> be<00:02:11.819> able<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.239> defeat<00:02:12.569> him

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.480 

mastering<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.170> little<00:02:27.440> trick<00:02:27.710> makes<00:02:28.340> us

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
mastering this little trick makes us

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.550 
mastering this little trick makes us
battle<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.880> heck<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.330> lot<00:02:29.450> easier<00:02:29.560> because

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
battle a heck of a lot easier because

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.810 
battle a heck of a lot easier because
normally<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.160> battle<00:02:31.430> ends<00:02:31.550> up<00:02:31.670> being

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
normally this battle ends up being

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:45.570 
normally this battle ends up being
really<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.570> tough<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.930> get<00:02:33.050> past

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.460 

once<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.730> deliver<00:02:47.060> enough<00:02:47.600> damage<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.110> judge

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
once you deliver enough damage to judge

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.590 
once you deliver enough damage to judge
zoom<00:02:48.770> he<00:02:49.190> will<00:02:49.430> fall<00:02:49.700> off<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.000> platform<00:02:50.270> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
zoom he will fall off the platform that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.460 
zoom he will fall off the platform that
you're<00:02:50.720> fighting<00:02:50.930> him<00:02:51.170> on<00:02:52.870> once<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.080> happens

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
you're fighting him on once this happens

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.160 
you're fighting him on once this happens
the<00:02:54.650> dip<00:02:54.860> caning<00:02:55.280> starts<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.730> shoot<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.020> what

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
said though the game can be very very

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.670 
said though the game can be very very
frustrating<00:04:07.480> because<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.870> how<00:04:07.989> random<00:04:08.590> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
frustrating because of how random the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.850 
frustrating because of how random the
item<00:04:09.010> placement<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.640> be<00:04:09.849> so<00:04:10.810> if<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.530> play<00:04:11.739> the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
item placement can be so if you play the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.470 
item placement can be so if you play the
game<00:04:11.890> enough<00:04:12.220> times<00:04:12.489> you'll<00:04:13.030> get<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.329> word

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480
