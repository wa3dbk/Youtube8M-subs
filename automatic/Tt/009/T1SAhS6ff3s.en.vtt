overworld now you can also craft a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.780 
overworld now you can also craft a
couple<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.780> cool<00:02:29.200> things<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.770> had<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.220> set

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
up but unfortunately crashed and that is

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.300 
up but unfortunately crashed and that is
called<00:02:34.300> an<00:02:34.570> air<00:02:34.900> scrubber<00:02:35.380> now<00:02:35.800> I'd<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.250> to

time now if you take a look at this if I
try<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.220> place<00:02:42.400> grass<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.480> moon<00:02:43.870> it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
try and place grass on this moon it

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.890 
try and place grass on this moon it
doesn't<00:02:45.100> work<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:45.940> pops<00:02:46.150> off<00:02:46.360> bamberg

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
doesn't work you just pops off bamberg

this is the kind of cool effect but they

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.340 
this is the kind of cool effect but they
can<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.239> pick<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.959> doesn't<00:02:50.200> work

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
can just pick it up and it doesn't work

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.050 
can just pick it up and it doesn't work
but<00:02:50.590> there<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.070> place<00:02:51.280> glowstone<00:02:51.820> you

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
machinery which you've learned how to do

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.850 
machinery which you've learned how to do
that<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.209> iron<00:03:25.630> ingots<00:03:26.019> iron<00:03:26.350> ingots<00:03:26.709> and

also redstone to create that now what

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.080 
also redstone to create that now what
you<00:03:29.830> need<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.489> kind<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.850> nice

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you need to do this is kind of a nice

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.060 
you need to do this is kind of a nice
nifty<00:03:31.510> trick<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.290> can<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.560> go<00:03:32.709> through<00:03:32.980> in

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
nifty trick you can just go through in

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.330 
nifty trick you can just go through in
here<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.489> here<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.750> air<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.500> can<00:03:35.860> press<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
here and here is the air I can press I

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.670 
here and here is the air I can press I
can<00:03:36.610> just<00:03:36.730> break<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.810> use<00:03:38.140> one<00:03:38.440> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
can just break that you can use one and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.670 
can just break that you can use one and
you<00:03:39.610> can<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.910> go<00:03:40.090> here<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.110> enter<00:03:41.560> in

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you can just go here and you enter in

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.070 
you can just go here and you enter in
through<00:03:41.709> here<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.310> voila<00:03:42.910> we<00:03:43.239> have<00:03:43.510> grass

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
through here and voila we have grass

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.680 
through here and voila we have grass
over<00:03:44.560> here<00:03:44.890> now<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:45.610> this<00:03:45.730> grass<00:03:46.060> does<00:03:46.420> is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
over here now what this grass does is

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.130 
over here now what this grass does is
actually<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.610> air<00:03:48.850> scrubber<00:03:49.269> scrubs<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
actually the air scrubber scrubs out and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.410 
actually the air scrubber scrubs out and
actually<00:03:50.410> changes<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.090> can<00:03:52.209> actually

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
actually changes it so you can actually

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.229 
actually changes it so you can actually
live<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.260> overworld<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.100> moon<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.700> it

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
live in the overworld in the moon and it

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.650 
live in the overworld in the moon and it
gets<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.170> air<00:03:56.350> sort<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.890> converted<00:03:57.640> back<00:03:57.940> but

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
gets the air sort of converted back but

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.500 
gets the air sort of converted back but
if<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.110> have<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> hole<00:03:59.890> here<00:04:00.340> for<00:04:00.820> example<00:04:01.000> if<00:04:01.420> a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
if I have a hole here for example if a

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.420 
if I have a hole here for example if a
punch<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.930> wall<00:04:01.959> all<00:04:02.320> this<00:04:02.530> will<00:04:02.769> break<00:04:03.040> ready

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
punch a wall all this will break ready

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.600 
punch a wall all this will break ready
who<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:03.880> BAM<00:04:04.390> all<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.530> broke<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:06.160> air<00:04:06.340> has

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
who this BAM all of it broke the air has

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.340 
who this BAM all of it broke the air has
been<00:04:06.820> leaked<00:04:07.060> doubts<00:04:07.329> who<00:04:07.480> needs<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.989> be<00:04:08.140> a

been leaked doubts who needs to be a
confined<00:04:08.980> space<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:10.090> if<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.239> go<00:04:10.269> block<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.780> off

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
confined space so if I go block it off

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.470 
confined space so if I go block it off
with<00:04:11.049> dirt<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.410> save<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.430> up<00:04:12.549> now<00:04:12.790> i<00:04:12.820> can<00:04:13.060> place

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
with dirt and save it up now i can place

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.409 
with dirt and save it up now i can place
up<00:04:13.980> place<00:04:14.980> my<00:04:15.160> grass<00:04:15.459> back<00:04:15.820> again<00:04:16.120> because<00:04:16.299> the

up place my grass back again because the

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.260 
up place my grass back again because the
air<00:04:16.600> has<00:04:16.780> been<00:04:16.810> converted<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.060> you've<00:04:19.060> got<00:04:19.180> to

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
air has been converted and you've got to

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.479 
air has been converted and you've got to
watch<00:04:19.359> out<00:04:19.539> for<00:04:19.599> those<00:04:19.870> nasty<00:04:20.530> spills<00:04:20.919> now

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
watch out for those nasty spills now

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.250 
this is why you have to have a safety
room<00:04:23.860> so

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
room so

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.470

is<00:04:24.380> sort<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.710> like<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.950> safety<00:04:25.370> hallway<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
is sort of like the safety hallway you

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.170 
is sort of like the safety hallway you
enter<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.110> in<00:04:27.260> you<00:04:27.860> go<00:04:28.400> through<00:04:28.640> here<00:04:28.850> once<00:04:29.090> you

cool it's kind of cool one thing that

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.080 
cool it's kind of cool one thing that
I'd<00:05:06.740> like<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.980> say<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.640> it<00:05:07.730> needs<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.000> be

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
I'd like to say that it needs to be

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.450 
I'd like to say that it needs to be
implemented<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:09.020> actual<00:05:09.260> earth<00:05:09.560> they<00:05:10.160> can

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
implemented is the actual earth they can

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.820 
implemented is the actual earth they can
see<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:10.760> maybe<00:05:11.030> some<00:05:11.330> more<00:05:11.650> Martians<00:05:12.650> or

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830

see and maybe some more Martians or
something<00:05:13.190> along<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.580> lines<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.970> that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
something along the lines of that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.030 
something along the lines of that
because<00:05:14.390> it<00:05:14.540> looks<00:05:14.720> kind<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.020> plane<00:05:15.470> just

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040
