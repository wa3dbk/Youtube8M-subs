00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
what makes our liquor system a little

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830 
what makes our liquor system a little
bit<00:04:55.710> different<00:04:56.190> than<00:04:56.460> other<00:04:56.630> pull<00:04:57.630> down

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
bit different than other pull down

bit different than other pull down
camper<00:04:58.290> manufacturers<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.940> we<00:05:00.090> actually

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
camper manufacturers is that we actually

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.440 
camper manufacturers is that we actually
have<00:05:00.780> no<00:05:01.440> cables<00:05:02.010> inside<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.850> liquor<00:05:03.060> post
