right<00:00:02.040> here's<00:00:02.250> an<00:00:02.370> update<00:00:02.669> on<00:00:02.700> my<00:00:03.589> half<00:00:04.589> 932

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
right here's an update on my half 932

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
right here's an update on my half 932
some<00:00:06.450> people<00:00:06.690> want<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.230> see<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:09.980> I'll<00:00:10.980> have

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
some people want to see this I'll have

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.669 
some people want to see this I'll have
these<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:12.120> hooked<00:00:12.360> up<00:00:12.450> yet<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.200> all

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
these all hooked up yet but you know all

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.129 
these all hooked up yet but you know all
I<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.160> super<00:00:14.340> glue<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:14.969> CPU<00:00:15.660> for

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
I have this super glue to the CPU for

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.290 
I have this super glue to the CPU for
actual<00:00:16.440> temperature<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.970> hooked<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
actual temperature this is hooked up to

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.590 
actual temperature this is hooked up to
my<00:00:18.570> own<00:00:18.720> water<00:00:19.619> cooling<00:00:19.949> pump<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:21.000> two<00:00:21.240> fans

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
my own water cooling pump these two fans

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.349 
my own water cooling pump these two fans
are<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.619> radiator<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
are my radiator this one is just on the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
are my radiator this one is just on the
back<00:00:24.570> back<00:00:25.260> side<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:27.859> now<00:00:28.859> these<00:00:28.980> are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
back back side for now now these are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
back back side for now now these are
just<00:00:29.220> ambient<00:00:29.699> temperatures<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:30.449> that's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just ambient temperatures which that's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.860 
just ambient temperatures which that's
called<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.769> damien<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.279> meters<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.700> now

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
called see damien two meters for now

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.150 
called see damien two meters for now
we're<00:00:33.870> at<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> 30<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.430> 32<00:00:35.760> volts<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:37.160> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
we're at like 30 to 32 volts or so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
we're at like 30 to 32 volts or so
that's<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.640> range<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> ambient

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that's the range of the ambient

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.950 
that's the range of the ambient
temperatures<00:00:39.899> after<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:41.090> ordering<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.360> cpu

gigahertz this what it looks like that
the<00:00:53.699> fans<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.480> figure<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> better

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the fans I actually figure out a better

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.740 
the fans I actually figure out a better
way<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> fans<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.789> four<00:00:57.390> LEDs

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
way to do the fans there are four LEDs

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
way to do the fans there are four LEDs
to<00:00:57.780> come<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> Sigma<00:00:58.559> tech<00:00:58.710> fans<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to come on the Sigma tech fans and I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.810 
to come on the Sigma tech fans and I
just<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.210> remove<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> LEDs<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.699> i

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just like remove the LEDs because i

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
just like remove the LEDs because i
installed<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:05.070> cold<00:01:05.700> cathode<00:01:06.150> UV<00:01:06.600> active<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
installed to cold cathode UV active so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
installed to cold cathode UV active so
it<00:01:09.060> lights<00:01:09.270> them<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> better<00:01:10.080> effect

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it lights them up with a better effect

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.240 
it lights them up with a better effect
and<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.700> white<00:01:11.909> LEDs<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> end<00:01:12.780> themselves<00:01:14.030> and

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
and the white LEDs on end themselves and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.810 
and the white LEDs on end themselves and
it's<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.520> too<00:01:17.670> bright<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.920> my<00:01:19.920> cpu<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it's probably too bright but my cpu is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's probably too bright but my cpu is
that<00:01:21.380> 70<00:01:22.380> 73<00:01:23.100> degrees<00:01:23.520> celsius<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.360> 72<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that 70 73 degrees celsius to 72 and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
that 70 73 degrees celsius to 72 and
this<00:01:25.680> has<00:01:25.830> been<00:01:25.950> running<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.549> hour

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this has been running for about an hour

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.359 
this has been running for about an hour
now<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.590> course<00:01:28.740> i'll<00:01:29.009> never

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
now so you know of course i'll never

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.569 
now so you know of course i'll never
like<00:01:30.210> during<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.600> actual<00:01:30.869> application<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.860> will

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
like during an actual application i will

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190 
like during an actual application i will
never<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.210> max<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.170> how

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
never you know max it out you know how

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.420 
never you know max it out you know how
two<00:01:34.350> percent<00:01:34.740> cpu<00:01:35.250> usage<00:01:35.689> for<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> long<00:01:37.020> but

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
two percent cpu usage for that long but

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.850 
two percent cpu usage for that long but
you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.520> whatever<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> test<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
you know whatever that's the test and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.639 
you know whatever that's the test and
that's<00:01:41.479> awesome<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:42.659> monitor<00:01:43.790> 24<00:01:44.790> inches
