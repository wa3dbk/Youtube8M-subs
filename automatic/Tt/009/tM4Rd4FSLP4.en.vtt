00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.430
 for such a hairstyle will need a bezel on 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.299
 elastic band 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.299
 collect hair 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.199
 [music] 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.180
 and the ends of the hair will fix the usual 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.180
 rubber band 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:30.460
 [music] 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.840
 rim in place gum wrap 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 the resulting tail 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.090
 [music] 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.900
 and strengthen the invisible 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 [music] 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.040
 Now our task is to wind the hair on 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.580
 the bezel is turning our design behind 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.580
 head 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.170
 and try to curl your hair 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.170
 as tight as possible 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.120
 [music] 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:22.940
 [music] 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.470
 a tubule of hair we press the head and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:34.220
 put the bezel on the forehead 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:39.780
 [music] 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.860
 stretch the tube a little and lay it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:56.909
 hair remaining under the gum 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:59.590
 [music] 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.960
 the opposite side of the bezel can 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.240
 put it on the mind or a little 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.679
 lift the hair as you like 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.789
