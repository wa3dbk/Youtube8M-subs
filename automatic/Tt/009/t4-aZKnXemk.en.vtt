00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
really nice explain and the main feature

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.340 
really nice explain and the main feature
of<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.270> is<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:56.600> let<00:03:57.600> me<00:03:57.630> put<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:57.990> brightness

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
of this is the let me put the brightness

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:06.080 
of this is the let me put the brightness
down<00:03:59.390> so<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.630> show<00:04:00.840> you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.790 

the<00:04:06.569> main<00:04:06.750> feature<00:04:07.050> though<00:04:07.290> saying<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:08.310> 3G

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
the main feature though saying is the 3G

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.520 
the main feature though saying is the 3G
so<00:04:10.800> basically<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.870> button<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.200> get<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
so basically this button and you get the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.110 
so basically this button and you get the
internet<00:04:14.780> never<00:04:15.780> had<00:04:15.990> a<00:04:16.019> 3G<00:04:16.410> phone<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:17.280> don't

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
internet never had a 3G phone so don't

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.449 
internet never had a 3G phone so don't
know<00:04:18.209> how<00:04:18.329> fast<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.900> actually<00:04:18.959> goes<00:04:19.459> guess

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
know how fast it actually goes guess

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.600 
know how fast it actually goes guess
we'll<00:04:20.700> see<00:04:20.880> now<00:04:21.060> that's<00:04:22.490> pretty<00:04:23.490> fast<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.940> guess

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
we'll see now that's pretty fast I guess

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.240 
we'll see now that's pretty fast I guess
already<00:04:26.610> all<00:04:26.730> loaded<00:04:30.770> actually<00:04:31.770> shows<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
already all loaded actually shows the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
time and status outside on the closing

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.390 
time and status outside on the closing
it's<00:04:36.240> pretty<00:04:36.450> cool<00:04:36.800> we<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.919> 2<00:04:38.160> megapixel
