up<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> side<00:00:43.739> panels<00:00:44.160> it'd<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> small

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
up the side panels it'd be a small

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
up the side panels it'd be a small
plastic<00:00:45.480> fastener<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> remove<00:00:46.559> we'll<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
plastic fastener to remove we'll do this

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.040 
plastic fastener to remove we'll do this
on<00:00:47.700> both<00:00:47.850> sides

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.340 

and<00:00:50.680> also<00:00:50.890> there'll<00:00:51.520> be<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.700> tie-down<00:00:52.390> point

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
and also there'll be a tie-down point

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.450 
and also there'll be a tie-down point
that<00:00:53.470> we<00:00:53.530> have<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.710> remove<00:00:53.890> as<00:00:54.070> well<00:00:54.100> on<00:00:54.340> the

that we have to remove as well on the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.200 
that we have to remove as well on the
inside<00:00:54.580> edge<00:00:56.670> we'll<00:00:57.670> do<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:58.090> both<00:00:58.240> sides

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
inside edge we'll do this on both sides

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.510 
inside edge we'll do this on both sides
and<00:01:01.210> now<00:01:01.390> there's<00:01:01.600> actual<00:01:01.960> small<00:01:02.380> panel<00:01:02.980> right

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
and now there's actual small panel right

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.760 
and now there's actual small panel right
behind<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:04.600> tail<00:01:04.809> light<00:01:04.989> set<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.290> remove<00:01:05.590> as

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
behind the tail light set to remove as

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.410 
behind the tail light set to remove as
well<00:01:05.820> we'll<00:01:06.820> do<00:01:06.940> this<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.240> both<00:01:07.360> sides<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:10.240> our

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
well we'll do this on both sides now our

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.210 
well we'll do this on both sides now our
interior<00:01:10.630> side<00:01:10.990> panels<00:01:11.410> we<00:01:11.770> want<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.010> pull

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
interior side panels we want to pull

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.620 
interior side panels we want to pull
them<00:01:12.280> out<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.880> far<00:01:13.150> enough<00:01:13.240> where<00:01:13.479> we<00:01:13.510> can

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
them out just far enough where we can

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.120 
them out just far enough where we can
work<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.990> get<00:01:14.110> our<00:01:14.140> hands<00:01:14.410> through<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
work to get our hands through to the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.760 
work to get our hands through to the
other<00:01:15.250> side<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.640> work<00:01:15.760> with<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.030> opening

wire harness grommet that's on the
driver's<00:02:36.550> side<00:02:36.930> we'll<00:02:37.930> make<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.080> cut<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.410> it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
driver's side we'll make a cut in it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.910 
driver's side we'll make a cut in it
with<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.709> knife<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.880> poke<00:02:40.120> our<00:02:40.270> wire<00:02:40.420> through

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
with a knife then poke our wire through

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.900 
with a knife then poke our wire through
we'll<00:02:41.920> go<00:02:42.069> ahead<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.310> pull<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.790> and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
we'll go ahead and pull it up and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.670 
we'll go ahead and pull it up and
through<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.780> then<00:02:43.900> it'll<00:02:44.020> go<00:02:44.140> back<00:02:44.170> behind<00:02:44.440> a

our buck connector we'll go ahead and
crimp<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.880> two<00:02:49.030> together<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:50.020> then<00:02:50.860> we'll

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
crimp the two together and then we'll

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.650 
crimp the two together and then we'll
attach<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.459> some<00:02:51.640> sheet<00:02:51.819> metal<00:02:52.030> that's
