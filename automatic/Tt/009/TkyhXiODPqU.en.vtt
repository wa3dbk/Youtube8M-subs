00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.800
 we came to lake baikal in order 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 to break the speed record on ice on 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.230
 ordinary serial car nissan gt-r 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.520
 for us these races are possible for now 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.100
 thinking symbolic character and we would 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 really wanted to be associated 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840
 with this russian 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.100
 Russian history but baikal seems to me 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.100
 beautiful symbol of Russia 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 military have to adjust the wheel 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.380
 the slightest pair of wind and machine literally 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 thrusts all seven 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.870
 kilometers of trails and you fight with 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.870
 element 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.840
 seemingly 540 horsepower on ice 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.410
 this is absolutely excess power but 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.350
 down they are jeeter we have a very important one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.510
 weighing this all -wheel drive that's it and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.819
 allows you to implement and huge 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.819
 torque and big powerful 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.670
 in the summer I thought 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.670
 on this occasion 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.690
 and then this
