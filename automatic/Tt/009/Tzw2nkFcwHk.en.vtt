the<00:01:50.560> stitches<00:01:51.039> very<00:01:51.310> flat<00:01:51.759> if<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.570> didn't

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
the stitches very flat if you didn't

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.290 
the stitches very flat if you didn't
have<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.229> paper<00:01:53.560> your<00:01:54.399> stitches<00:01:54.880> would<00:01:55.030> want

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
have the paper your stitches would want

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.719 
have the paper your stitches would want
to<00:01:55.570> pull<00:01:56.050> together<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.740> little<00:01:56.979> bit<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.280> you'd

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
to pull together a little bit and you'd

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.639 
to pull together a little bit and you'd
have<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> little<00:01:58.179> bit<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.509> buckling<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.500> the

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
have a little bit of buckling so the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.279 
have a little bit of buckling so the
paper<00:01:59.920> keeps<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.460> nice<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.670> flat<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.539> the

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
paper keeps it nice and flat and the

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.700 
paper keeps it nice and flat and the
extra<00:02:02.740> fabric<00:02:03.300> gives<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.509> strength<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.530> we'll

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
extra fabric gives it strength so we'll

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.050 
extra fabric gives it strength so we'll
just<00:02:05.950> trim<00:02:06.310> away<00:02:06.460> some<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.390> extra<00:02:07.780> fabric

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
just trim away some of the extra fabric

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:22.380 
just trim away some of the extra fabric
like<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.829> that's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.340> repair

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.450
