00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
 at 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 hey hi to all and zombie yoda 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.060
 factory today I'm in company 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.430
 of lady 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 we continue so its is a video a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.640
 little bit special because we're going 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.259
 just show you all the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 possible interactions with the decor 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.919
 in your different maps of call of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 Duty multiplayer so kid so for 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.520
 the first map the ten we will 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.019
 find on prison break that then there 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 we are surprised zone should at home 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.110
 already I am there is a marble that we 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 can destroy and that is then on 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.650
 this mafia 2 possible interactions by 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.820
 but here we do not know all the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.769
 interactions either we have not yet 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.019
 do it all the way 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.400
 really gaming and that's the first 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.540
 you can also shot from saf and we 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.839
 guard that lets you cross the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.309
 river 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.650
 me I almost fell while m 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.930
 the balanced chirac is the second 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.000
 interactions go here at the level of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.119
 logs is not bad in 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 research 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.950
 I think you just have to run a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 pomegranate on the pile of wooden logs 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.790
 to collapse this one sees 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 amateurism dre quite so we 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.060
 find next strike so we get 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 found on the map 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 octane and again new 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.400
 interactions with the decor then we're going 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 show you it's happening to him from the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 gas station 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.030
 So that's it's farting here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.340
 you can get through and the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.290
 second year here the syrups so here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.570
 ensures campers here is actually at 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.850
 level of the hamlet of pomegranate 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.430
 so that's the spot the stop decanter 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 actually here is at the level of at 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.470
 you can destroy the wall 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.030
 we will go to the next map and 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 so we end up on the marten is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.940
 dead so here is only two small 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 interactions it's the same stories 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.590
 different rights so the first 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.640
 it's here at the trash level you 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 I said I let you push the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.810
 trash to show it's the woman who 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
 do everything 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.620
 so it's a market at wells that grows 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.360
 the trash one to a second here just 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.370
 there and suddenly you can go up by 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.230
 scale 1 is okay that's it allows 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 to scale up and the second 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.470
 trash cans is right here in fact one 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 sees a kind of yellow logo that we get 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.980
 fed up with it and it allows the push 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.500
 this is not very very very useful 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.730
 but ok me ok first as much I 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.650
 see the interest the second I sell it 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.970
 a little less six years that yeah maybe 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 for the point of view with respect to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.700
 the enemy would not leave well then we 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.930
 found on the freight map and I 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.620
 listening for the interactions I 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.780
 did not want everything 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.430
 so here to a lot of interaction this 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.320
 map has it so the first one is going to be here 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.840
 in fact it's a pretty familiar rush in 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.760
 so search a tunnel so from 2.1 to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.810
 time is back to lady in fact on one side 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.680
 on the other side of the tunnel you can 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.500
 close the door 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.720
 by pressing square on this case here 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 here is the close the door and it will place 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.400
 and may be put on both sides 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840
 the age of the room and team and we 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 can do that on that side on this 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.440
 casing which here next which otherwise 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.880
 it's an alba stop in my opinion not bad 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.170
 of the world knows it but we can open 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 this grid has it by pulling on it 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.620
 by stabbing or 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.560
 former Lyon far away by launching a 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.410
 grenade altogether then the others 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.660
 interests are at this point it will go 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.200
 there are doors actually offering like that 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.330
 seems all the time small 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 housings actually makes you square and that 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.269
 will open and close doors then he 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 are a lot of doors on this map there in 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.510
 to another here I think that's me 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.760
 united if there is the same behind there of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.709
 the other side of the farmhouse he goes here too he 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 I think it's bad to go 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.230
 in fact it's all the doors of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.530
 buildings you can all closed in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.880
 made 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.310
 in fact to simply keep the 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.920
 doors we can shift a choice ya 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.720
 a lot of doors and you more so to 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.959
 this level there pull on the scale for the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.959
 knock down 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.090
 and here he gives himself access to the top of the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.450
 building this door the door one can 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.890
 not see her 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.150
 ok okay good then system features 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.360
 drawn but that we think we did the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.850
 turn for this map there we find ourselves 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.140
 on the map stands will make a map enough 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.180
 big is not the building 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.269
 here we spotted a room 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.390
 interactions with ziona's decor 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.310
 others we do not know too much at this level 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.269
 in fact that's in search they stay 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.050
 good in the face if you can run 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.820
 for auch and use the elevator me 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.690
 it's long enough to go up but then they 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.380
 we did not put any small music 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.430
 mood 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.420
 I am a little disappointed and here we climbed 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.130
 a wow level 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.960
 this is the only attraction we have 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.020
 may have noticed for the moment in this 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.580
 map la and mac following the map 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.050
 overlord then apparently there would be 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.820
 closed on this map 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.740
 I will follow you I do not know them 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.780
 also then yielded big the big ones 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.920
 doors like that makes it sliding 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:58.390
 inside there are small housings 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.470
 do here go support for it 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.810
 close the central doors 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.810
 ok same thing for the other side i think 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.460
 same thing for the other side quite 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.690
 and that's to leave the two alone 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.360
 doors that can be opened and closed in 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.770
 done in this map there is not much 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.300
 a lot of interactions but it's nice 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.300
 especially looking to block a little 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.830
 the enemy for the whole and we continue 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.680
 with the amap chasm apparently there 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.900
 would have an elevator car to do 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.490
 fall quite so at level 2b 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.990
 for those who play in search of a 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.900
 small cabin that is here because 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.510
 here is actually pulling so we 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.130
 can get through and anti-Roma on 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.330
 the impeccable said i will test on a 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.970
 cable is telling his sister will come down 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.130
 of a level and we hear it a centex 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:50.320
 in gold exploits in life you go 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:58.810
 die then the elevator falls while 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:06:00.720
 down with the 10 here we go we're going 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.700
 find yourself on the last map 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.240
 and finally the last matt so that's the 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.460
 map stop stop not so good 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.170
 means ford castle like that just 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.880
 not too much in fact there is only one 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.400
 attraction it's at the level of the grid 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.870
 of the castle 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.200
 I leave my feature to Lady in account and 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.090
 to make it fall like these what 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.830
 can be quite practical in 1st wise 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.900
 for example Saturday that the bomb b is 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.250
 right here you put the shot 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.850
 the enemy can not go through that is 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.030
 pretty interesting 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.070
 finally it's a brake a brake rather 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.050
 inefficient since a simple scene 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.180
 text on the door and you can fart 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.060
 opening on condition of not you 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.700
 do of course 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.960
 alas die get through so see 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.150
 we really hope that this video will 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.230
 pleased for this fight call of duty ghost 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.910
 we recall that there is a small competition 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.290
 that we launched today and who you 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.020
 allows to win call of duty cause so 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.090
 on pc and ps3 or xbox do not hesitate to 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.080
 try your luck and then not you 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.560
 do big kisses we tell you to 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.790
 very soon 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.790
 soon everyone
