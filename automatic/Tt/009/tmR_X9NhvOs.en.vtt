00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.549
 Magdeburg 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 the fight went and especially around the stadiums is getting more and more brutal 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.190
 Denise definitely set a new dimension at de 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.349
 work now we have not diminished 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.589
 popular technology last week 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.980
 Tense mood before the Ostderby Union Berlin against Hansa Rostock 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 more than a thousand police are waiting at the station for the hansa fans 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 the fan-groups are enemies one reckons with the worst 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.530
 but for many hours is to cancel for a failure 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.080
 Thousands of 200 hansa fans the difference march the so-called problem fans 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.050
 through the Berlin suburb 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.930
 d 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 4 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.760
 then suddenly the margin died 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.070
 the Rostock fans got their tickets at a roadblock 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 do not show 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.060
 the situation escalates 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 Stones flying water cannons were in front 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 it arrives 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 This time the police managed to control the enemy situation 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.420
 hold 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.210
 January 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 January 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.370
 that does not always work 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.300
 especially when playing in minor leagues like here in hall riots take 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 to 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.840
 private 20 years member of the notorious Borussia 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.610
 one of the most brutal Berlin peaceful groups 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.330
 then he got out 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 But he still has contact with the scene 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 Bürki beautiful described 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.830
 everyone just wants from 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.670
 in addition to martial artists and praised sports injuries and competitors 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.880
 and therefore they can keep solving them we would consider if we were afraid 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699
 we do not work anymore 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.309
 and fourth 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.309
 a hole still burning tons would be recalled 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.339
 Harald Hauswald has known the hooligan scene for 25 years 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.639
 he photographed in football stadiums even at ddr times 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.159
 Over the years, he has to make contacts as to left-wing violent offenders 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.379
 built up 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.549
 the "open brutality about football matches still terrifies him 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.959
 bitter for biological strength tests and so do not change in age still so expensive 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 so can be reliable 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.969
 and its image the East go in gusts and at first 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.669
 Berlin "They are organized so that they know exactly 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.879
 Before I am just unusually unsure it has to work and keep coming back 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.379
 rain 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.009
 which neglected 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.399
 it's election campaign hanging everywhere npd posters 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.019
 and an explosive arrest is pending 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.899
 15 again Saxony has left Lokomotiv Leipzig against right 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.969
 then fly from Ernst h 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.789
 Defense go on each other 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.879
 Several hundreds of police are on duty The derby is about to be demolished 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.559
 after ten minutes the game continues 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.679
 The stadium prepares for the riots after the final whistle 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.089
 he is one always there 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.209
 the locomotive trailer has lifelong stadium ban Elazig 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.969
 some criminal charges for assault run against him 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.699
 that is another reason why he wants to remain unrecognized 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.060
 the adrenalin level around the rising 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.040
 what makes you happy is a beautiful hot and on trial 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.020
 Show everything clearly that he then affirmed that again this time 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.719
 create 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.520
 After the game it gets down to business 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.079
 our camera gets a punch missed 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.059
 We still continued 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.099
 Supporters of both sides engage in street battles with the police 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.019
 Unbelievable on the verge of riots, we see a npd campaign bus 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.609
 we follow his route 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.859
 the NPD is placarding and trying to attract followers of the rock 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.690
 Mark Cuban the quiet is also npd-functional and campaigner 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.440
 Of course there are one or the other 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.310
 about strategy 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.020
 The football field in Leipzig is of course very suitable for that 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.810
 Malheur exactly knows where to place the poster 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.639
 and that can appeal to people, and of course it will 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.700
 exploited we have found that was in the football field miracles hope 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.979
 in the area of ​​infotainment there is no polarization between left and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:38.960
 right 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.050
 and therefore very targeted attacks but then also 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.169
 Any violence within limits Bush's weapons will be used and and and so will Bush 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.990
 such a dispute exists 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.030
 to the very interesting aspect that you can then recognize again 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.410
 When police enters the two play enemies in a temporary 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.410
 Combat combat against the police 2 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.889
 Violence among so-called football fans 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.430
 SID not only in the lower leagues a problem in the second Bundesliga 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.699
 violence is omnipresent 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.979
 like here in the game of FC St Pauli against Rostock 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.830
 what can be done about it 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.370
 The DFB has been supporting many projects for many years to prevent violent excesses 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.110
 how does the DFB explain the violence? 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.000
 It is blessed with Victory to become certain youth culture only with us 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.600
 Of course all the brands Barum are visited a bit and so on 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.680
 Authority to drive percent if you realize I'm successful 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.199
 get a certain backlash of course it also makes a piece 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.059
 is much more fun and and that's what I wanted to paper 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.520
 bring the numbers have really been pronounced 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.699
 For the DFB as well as for many clubs, football is one 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.309
 million deal 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.389
 the cost of the expensive police operations is borne by the taxpayer 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.910
 Rondé declared a man who demanded all-right citizen of Gabon Lebanon 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.860
 Footballer days will be eleven days and Bernau 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.460
 but that is far from that 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.020
 the right-wing extremist violence and football 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.629
 a highly explosive mixture
