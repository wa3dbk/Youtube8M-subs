00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.150
 so that is neat 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.680
 yes friends friends we have 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.410
 test a new car in nature 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 garage and volkswagen passat variant one 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 point 6 tdi 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 this is really such a car that by jan 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 and everyone is hailed he is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 named car of the year and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 everywhere you read that this is pretty much the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.830
 choice in the segment should be and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 so I am a little bad against that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.430
 because I bet we are real too 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 what to complain about this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.550
 and precisely because everywhere is so lyrical 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.929
 is being written 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
 We will throw one for this first 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.010
 as a report directly into the deep 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.910
 or frankly in the high because there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.680
 sit so true and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.719
 altimeter in this car that gives now 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.140
 min 4 meters I am curious where we 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.140
 are going to come true 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.130
 and hop okay before you know it we drive in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 Austria , those things go so fast 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.410
 nowadays 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.270
 we are on our way to the grossglockner 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.400
 hochalpenstrasse 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 that grossglockner is a very famous and 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.910
 important name 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 to car enthusiasts and car manufacturers 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 because it is the highest with car too 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 prepare only in austria and thereby 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 it is a hugely popular road for that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 car manufacturers for their new models 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 to develop 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 just look at this trade mark for example 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 have already seen several variants 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.010
 test drive on this hochalpenstrasse 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.130
 and also this car this specific passat 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.740
 has its development work here 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.509
 so in theory would be ours 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 endurance tests must be flawless here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.660
 achieve 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.450
 well we are rising considerably 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.890
 altimeter is currently at 1080 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.600
 meter 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.770
 so we still have a lot of climbing work 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 go see what actually 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 those highs and lows of this car 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530
 to be 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.330
 the first highlight for me 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.970
 the comfort of this trade because there 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.910
 one is this car really very good we 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 now have 1083 from the Netherlands 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.840
 kilometers traveled and every kilometer 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 convinced this car with such a rest 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.050
 board 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.819
 at least of the chassis than the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.800
 suspension and damping is very nice balance 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.460
 has a lot 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.470
 yes a kind of peace of mind 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.890
 which makes the long-distance journey whole 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 pleasant and although the 17 inch 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.520
 wheels are under this car 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.140
 there is no trace of unrest and that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 is very nice 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.280
 and I can imagine that you care about that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.080
 would like to have this car 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.049
 However, contrasting with instant 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.140
 low point and that is the engine 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.319
 we have a point 6 tdi with 120hp like 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.549
 I said and yes that does not hold for a while 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.900
 about how i am just not among the 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.480
 impression of that engine 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.890
 so let a four-cylinder slide say 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440
 as long as it is in the Netherlands 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.269
 quiet and flat surface is then goes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.110
 fine but as soon as it needs a bit 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.269
 go to work 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.269
 yes it's just not good 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.299
 yes what is not good then well 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.569
 pulling power at the bottom is actually there 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.209
 just not at all if you are slow 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.340
 but certainly the speed had risen to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.560
 about 19 in the duration then that fits 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.079
 at the 1900 loose 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 then switch it down again 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.829
 and then he needs time to get up again 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.500
 rinse and it really isn't alone on it 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.129
 this steep mountain pass it's just every 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.359
 raschel 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.280
 for example, at a roundabout 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.450
 distracted and you're just off your grass 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.010
 in 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.720
 anticipates the other traffic and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.750
 then goes on your gas again that gives 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.440
 motorcycle not at home and in a car anyway 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.250
 44 45,000 euros pier I really mean that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.250
 back to two 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.510
 and there is that only yes you know that see 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.040
 we with other engines from others 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.720
 manufacturers really do better and that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.720
 is really a downside to this achievement 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.199
 on the other hand , a highlight is the 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.329
 space on board this car 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.389
 This is really a Busan family car 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.709
 you can tell by everything here in the front I have 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.079
 even I have enough space 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.000
 I can also sit behind myself 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.730
 headroom legroom fine 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 and the luggage space is also very spacious 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.129
 can not say otherwise he is now 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.349
 completely full of 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.569
 report stuff and the can just still 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.319
 more when it really is a car and drive 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.639
 with a family of four and five people 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.199
 excellent with it 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.659
 small depth dots is still it 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.489
 lack of storage space for this in the 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.500
 interior although you have large 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.239
 porter compartments and cup holders here 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.889
 the middle but otherwise there is none 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.900
 space to live away from your phone 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.310
 what little stuff that is in earlier 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.840
 passage has been better and from one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.719
 car in the d-segment, I think 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.979
 that you can expect better 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.209
 but well let's end we are 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.599
 almost at the top of the grossglockner 

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:39.179
 you highlight with a positive note 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.459
 to this car and that is the good thing 

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:44.159
 feeling that this volkswagen gives you it 

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:45.479
 interior is very very neat 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.239
 all terribly well put together 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.099
 and for forty-four thousand and seven 

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:52.499
 a hundred euros you have a car with whole 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.809
 what nice and modern stuff you have 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.949
 a digital dashboard with very beautiful 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:57.330
 graphics 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.339
 you have all kinds of systems that you 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.110
 help on the road to keep it safe 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:04.249
 the active cruise control that pieces 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.249
 works better on a few years ago 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.800
 your foot so well a all of these fibers 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.719
 car that it is a pleasant modern thing 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.619
 is for that matter Volkswagen has the 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.619
 exists well for each other 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:34.009
 those are just gifts guys we are 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.469
 There is 2579 meters in height he has it 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.599
 made his first major expedition 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.489
 the brakes in the first intermediate conclusion 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.949
 smell the link touches but the passat 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:44.629
 has survived and is and extremely 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.149
 complete and versatile car 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.099
 he is not perfect but i think this 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:50.779
 very very nice it takes months to go 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.759
 be and therefore you do naturally 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.889
 immediately get your help again because you want it 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.659
 Participate in this endurance test than you 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.969
 idea for a story or a video 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.110
 with this car to car week it 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.459
 autoweek.nl 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.449
 and who knows, maybe I'll come and visit you 

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.449
 we have a nice bars together
