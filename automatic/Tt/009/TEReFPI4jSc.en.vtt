back to him for relatively low purchase
price<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.460> we<00:00:34.180> decided<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.840> essentially

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
price and we decided to essentially

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.770 
components do not exist anywhere else so
we<00:02:25.200> need<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> lot<00:02:26.040> more<00:02:26.069> than<00:02:26.849> any<00:02:27.330> other

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
we need to do a lot more than any other

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
we need to do a lot more than any other
factories<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:28.980> been<00:02:29.129> add<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.790> terms

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
factories that I have been add in terms

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.869 
factories that I have been add in terms
of<00:02:30.420> sub<00:02:30.930> processes<00:02:31.500> inside<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.129> factory<00:02:32.489> we

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
of sub processes inside the factory we

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.449 
of sub processes inside the factory we
do<00:02:33.030> about<00:02:33.299> 95%<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.500> our<00:02:34.650> time<00:02:34.920> cleaning<00:02:35.190> house

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
do about 95% of our time cleaning house

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.420 
do about 95% of our time cleaning house
we<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.330> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.750> machining<00:02:37.260> in-house<00:02:37.590> we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
we do a lot of the machining in-house we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.520 
we do a lot of the machining in-house we
do<00:02:38.579> some<00:02:39.030> coding<00:02:39.390> in-house<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:40.170> do<00:02:40.230> painting

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
do some coding in-house we do painting

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.319 
do some coding in-house we do painting
in-house<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.610> center<00:02:42.000> display

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
in-house we do the center display

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.650 
in-house we do the center display
in-house<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.519> level<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.940> integration<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
in-house so the level of integration is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780 
in-house so the level of integration is
very<00:02:45.870> very<00:02:46.079> high<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:47.160> everything<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
very very high and because everything is

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270 
very very high and because everything is
here<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.510> speeds<00:02:48.930> things<00:02:49.049> up<00:02:49.410> greatly<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
here it speeds things up greatly and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.119 
here it speeds things up greatly and
that<00:02:50.879> speed<00:02:51.299> has<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.660> lot<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.049> intrinsic<00:02:52.739> value

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
that speed has a lot of intrinsic value

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.660 
that speed has a lot of intrinsic value
in<00:02:53.760> terms<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.090> innovation<00:02:54.470> adaptability

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
in terms of innovation adaptability

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.300 
in terms of innovation adaptability
flexibility<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.390> them<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> future<00:02:58.709> we
