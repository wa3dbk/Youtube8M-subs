00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
out of it started tinkering with my

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
out of it started tinkering with my
pedals<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.129> decided<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> build<00:00:53.399> my<00:00:53.579> own<00:00:54.559> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
pedals and decided to build my own you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
pedals and decided to build my own you
know<00:00:55.680> Warwick's<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.670> okay<00:00:57.180> tone<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
know Warwick's got an okay tone to it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:13.039 
know Warwick's got an okay tone to it
people<00:00:58.140> seem<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.770> it<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> fine<00:01:12.630> but

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
people seem to like it which is fine but

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.730 
people seem to like it which is fine but
it's<00:01:13.200> not<00:01:13.260> Chancellor<00:01:13.860> uh<00:01:15.320> here<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> don't<00:01:16.590> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's not Chancellor uh here I don't know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's not Chancellor uh here I don't know
exactly<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> play<00:01:17.430> his<00:01:17.909> songs<00:01:18.240> never

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
exactly how to play his songs never

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
exactly how to play his songs never
really<00:01:18.900> studied<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.909> I'm<00:01:20.909> assuming

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really studied them but I'm assuming

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.280 
really studied them but I'm assuming
this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> goes

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this is how it goes

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:38.330 
this is how it goes
here<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> knot<00:01:23.460> tool<00:01:23.820> tone

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.410 

like<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:39.430> said<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.640> don't<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:40.060> don't<00:01:40.150> know<00:01:40.330> if

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
like I said I don't I don't know if

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.660 
like I said I don't I don't know if
that's<00:01:40.570> how<00:01:40.659> he<00:01:40.690> really<00:01:40.930> plays<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.549> I've

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
that's how he really plays it so I've

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.800 
that's how he really plays it so I've
been<00:01:42.729> messing<00:01:43.000> with<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:43.210> pedal<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.659> think

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
been messing with this pedal I think

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.600 
been messing with this pedal I think
I've<00:01:43.900> got<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.110> pretty<00:01:44.380> close<00:01:44.619> tone<00:01:44.979> obviously

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
I've got a pretty close tone obviously

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.600 
I've got a pretty close tone obviously
it's<00:01:45.729> not<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.909> $7,000<00:01:46.720> wall<00:01:47.020> bass<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:48.520> not

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it's not a $7,000 wall bass so it's not

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.760 
it's not a $7,000 wall bass so it's not
going<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.850> be<00:01:48.940> perfect<00:01:49.360> he's<00:01:49.570> got<00:01:49.810> some<00:01:50.590> more

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
going to be perfect he's got some more

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.190 
going to be perfect he's got some more
tweaking<00:01:51.070> than<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.430> have<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.750> all<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.080> his

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
tweaking than I have it's all in his

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.830 
tweaking than I have it's all in his
preamp<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.360> here's<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> tone<00:01:55.659> I'm

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
preamp and so here's the tone I'm

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.210 
preamp and so here's the tone I'm
getting<00:01:56.200> out<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.710> pedal<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.100> I've

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
getting out of the pedal that I've

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:15.660 
getting out of the pedal that I've
created<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:58.270> if<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.420> guys<00:01:58.540> think<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:58.869> close

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:26.610 

I<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:24.370> I'm<00:02:24.489> getting<00:02:24.760> somewhere<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.620> within

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
I think I'm getting somewhere I'm within

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.350 
I think I'm getting somewhere I'm within
the<00:02:26.890> range<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.280> most<00:02:27.520> normal<00:02:27.730> ears<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
the range of most normal ears that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.430 
the range of most normal ears that
sounded<00:02:28.720> pretty<00:02:28.810> close

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
sounded pretty close

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.530 
sounded pretty close
some<00:02:30.280> guys<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.640> course<00:02:30.670> will<00:02:30.940> call<00:02:31.090> me<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.300> say

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
some guys of course will call me on say

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.150 
some guys of course will call me on say
new<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.750> doesn't<00:02:32.110> sound<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.440> will<00:02:32.739> kiss

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
new it doesn't sound like that will kiss

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:45.259 
new it doesn't sound like that will kiss
off<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.610> didn't<00:02:33.819> make<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> pedal<00:02:34.300> I<00:02:34.390> did

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.520 

so<00:02:46.269> I'm<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.629> ballpark<00:02:46.750> there<00:02:47.230> with<00:02:47.409> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
so I'm in the ballpark there with that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.630 
so I'm in the ballpark there with that
