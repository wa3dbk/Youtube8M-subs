to practice those random acts of

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.509 
to practice those random acts of
kindness<00:03:42.450> when<00:03:43.290> people<00:03:43.590> talk<00:03:43.769> about<00:03:43.799> right

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
talking about that and we think of two

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.770 
talking about that and we think of two
pieces<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.840> research<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.920> came<00:04:02.100> from<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
pieces of research that came from the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.770 
pieces of research that came from the
pen<00:04:03.780> program<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.620> resilience<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.690> one<00:04:06.690> of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
pen program in the resilience and one of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.930 
pen program in the resilience and one of
them<00:04:06.900> was<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.260> challenge<00:04:07.860> your<00:04:08.250> thoughts

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
them was to challenge your thoughts

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.020 
them was to challenge your thoughts
right<00:04:09.390> away<00:04:09.660> like<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:11.310> really

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
right away like if you have a really

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.000 
right away like if you have a really
negative<00:04:12.269> thought<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:13.140> something<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:13.830> not

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
negative thought or something that's not

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.640 
negative thought or something that's not
you<00:04:14.850> know<00:04:14.880> feeling<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.840> all<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.320> means

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
you know feeling right of all this means

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.070 
you know feeling right of all this means
I'm<00:04:17.040> not<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.549> get<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.910> or<00:04:18.120> very<00:04:18.750> first

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
I'm not going to get this or very first

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.780 
I'm not going to get this or very first
thing<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.590> would<00:04:19.709> be<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.890> challenge<00:04:20.340> your

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
thing to do would be to challenge your

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.240 
thing to do would be to challenge your
thought<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.440> that<00:04:22.650> negative<00:04:22.860> thought

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
thought so that that negative thought

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.510 
thought so that that negative thought
doesn't<00:04:23.729> really<00:04:23.910> get<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.180> toehold<00:04:25.070> well<00:04:26.070> if<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
doesn't really get a toehold well if I

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.480 
doesn't really get a toehold well if I
think

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
think

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.200 
think
Yeah<00:04:27.970> right<00:04:29.160> right<00:04:30.160> everything's<00:04:30.970> going

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
going to get to work they're gonna fire

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.879 
going to get to work they're gonna fire
me<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.389> other<00:04:37.599> words<00:04:37.840> when<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:38.740> have<00:04:38.860> a

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
me like in other words when we have a

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.680 
me like in other words when we have a
negative<00:04:39.069> thought<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.699> sort<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:40.030> pulls<00:04:40.360> all

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
negative thought it sort of pulls all

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.900 
negative thought it sort of pulls all
the<00:04:40.810> other<00:04:40.960> negative<00:04:41.440> thoughts<00:04:41.650> on<00:04:41.889> it<00:04:42.729> would

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the other negative thoughts on it would

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.969 
the other negative thoughts on it would
be<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.090> way<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.360> challenge<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.500> negativity

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
be a way to challenge that negativity

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.770 
be a way to challenge that negativity
right<00:04:45.340> up<00:04:45.550> front<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.120> challenge<00:04:46.539> it<00:04:46.630> by

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
right up front and you challenge it by

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.439 
right up front and you challenge it by
saying<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:48.250> there<00:04:48.639> another<00:04:48.849> way<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.090> look<00:04:49.330> at

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
saying is there another way to look at

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.629 
saying is there another way to look at
this<00:04:51.660> yes<00:04:52.660> I'm<00:04:53.259> gonna<00:04:53.440> be<00:04:53.530> 15<00:04:54.099> minutes<00:04:54.280> late

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
but I'll be able to explain what

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.510 
but I'll be able to explain what
happened<00:04:58.020> or<00:04:59.020> even<00:04:59.440> better

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
happened or even better

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.760 
happened or even better
is<00:05:00.729> there<00:05:01.000> something<00:05:01.449> positive<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.409> might

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
is there something positive that might

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.980 
is there something positive that might
be<00:05:03.009> happening<00:05:03.550> here<00:05:04.030> maybe<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.479> other<00:05:04.539> bus

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
be happening here maybe that other bus

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.890 
be happening here maybe that other bus
gets<00:05:05.349> stuck<00:05:05.740> in<00:05:05.889> traffic<00:05:06.099> and<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:07.539> know<00:05:07.659> isn't

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
gets stuck in traffic and you know isn't

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.689 
gets stuck in traffic and you know isn't
going<00:05:08.169> to<00:05:08.259> get<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.500> work<00:05:08.680> on<00:05:08.889> time<00:05:09.099> but<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.490> just

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
going to get to work on time but to just

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.879 
going to get to work on time but to just
challenge<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.330> negative<00:05:10.930> thought<00:05:11.169> right<00:05:11.710> at

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
challenge the negative thought right at

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.830 
challenge the negative thought right at
its<00:05:12.099> base<00:05:12.340> because<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:12.880> think<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.630> four

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
its base because I think that the four

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.320 
its base because I think that the four
things<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.169> said<00:05:14.470> are<00:05:14.650> exactly<00:05:15.310> right

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
things you said are exactly right

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
things you said are exactly right
but<00:05:16.599> sometimes<00:05:17.050> when<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.560> negative<00:05:18.069> stuff

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
but sometimes when the negative stuff

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.999 
but sometimes when the negative stuff
gets<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.819> toehold<00:05:19.240> on<00:05:19.479> us<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.960> keeps<00:05:20.530> us<00:05:20.770> from

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
gets a toehold on us it keeps us from

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.279 
gets a toehold on us it keeps us from
even<00:05:21.340> doing<00:05:21.789> these<00:05:22.000> things<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:22.659> challenging

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
even doing these things so challenging

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.559 
even doing these things so challenging
the<00:05:23.409> negativity<00:05:24.069> might<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.819> one<00:05:25.330> way<00:05:25.360> to

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
the negativity might be one way to

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.140 
the negativity might be one way to
loosen<00:05:26.349> that<00:05:26.680> up<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.099> let<00:05:27.490> these<00:05:27.639> four<00:05:27.970> things

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
loosen that up and let these four things

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.690 
loosen that up and let these four things
flourish
