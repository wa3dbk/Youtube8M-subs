00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that's it and for the ipod I like it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.730 
that's it and for the ipod I like it
better<00:02:08.190> cause<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.879> lie<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> much

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
better cause the lie out here is much

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.670 
better cause the lie out here is much
more<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:12.890> map<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:15.680> you're

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
more like map and it's all like you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.710 
more like map and it's all like you're
the<00:02:16.800> command<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> nestle<00:02:17.880> toll<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.450> can

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the command of nestle toll on you can

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.880 
the command of nestle toll on you can
yes<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.220> what<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.400> mean<00:02:20.550> yeah<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.770> if<00:02:22.770> you
