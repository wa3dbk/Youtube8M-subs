alright guys on this one 2002 Nissan

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.010 
alright guys on this one 2002 Nissan
Pathfinder<00:00:20.090> transmission<00:00:21.470> re4<00:00:22.640> ro1<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.020> the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
Pathfinder transmission re4 ro1 a the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.870 
Pathfinder transmission re4 ro1 a the
problem<00:00:25.290> with<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.800> he<00:00:25.920> came<00:00:26.100> in<00:00:26.369> had<00:00:26.849> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
problem with this as he came in had a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.650 
problem with this as he came in had a
hard<00:00:27.390> coat<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.020> PL<00:00:28.290> 740<00:00:29.040> which<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> TCC

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
hard coat of a PL 740 which is the TCC

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.860 
hard coat of a PL 740 which is the TCC
circuit<00:00:31.310> this<00:00:32.310> is<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.730> electrical<00:00:33.300> code<00:00:33.570> for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
circuit this is an electrical code for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.710 
circuit this is an electrical code for
the<00:00:33.989> Nissan<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> could<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
the Nissan so as you could see I got the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.940 
the Nissan so as you could see I got the
pan<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.440> solenoid

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
pan down I have the solenoid

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
pan down I have the solenoid
disconnected<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:39.690> lock<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.050> solenoid

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
disconnected the lock up solenoid

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
disconnected the lock up solenoid
disconnected<00:00:41.160> which<00:00:41.310> one<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> good

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
disconnected which one thing is a good

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.009 
disconnected which one thing is a good
thing<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.480> solenoid<00:00:45.480> pack<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
thing because the solenoid pack is on

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.599 
thing because the solenoid pack is on
the<00:00:46.140> other<00:00:46.320> side<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.920> buddy<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> drop

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
the other side of our buddy have to drop

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.660 
the other side of our buddy have to drop
the<00:00:47.730> valve<00:00:47.910> body<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.680> lockup

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the valve body for that and the lockup

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.930 
the valve body for that and the lockup
salon<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.239> by<00:00:51.390> itself<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.820> we're

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
salon is all by itself so what we're

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.009 
salon is all by itself so what we're
going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.359> we're<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
going to do is we're going to take the

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.020 
going to do is we're going to take the
celluloid<00:00:55.769> down<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.870> omit

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
celluloid down and we are going to omit

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.829 
celluloid down and we are going to omit
against<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> new<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:02.449> what's<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.719> on

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
against a new one to see what's going on

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.570 
against a new one to see what's going on
with<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> let<00:01:04.320> me<00:01:04.410> give<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.710> shot<00:01:04.980> of<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
with that let me give you a shot of the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
with that let me give you a shot of the
solenoid<00:01:06.500> real<00:01:07.500> quick

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.890 

that's<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.590> right<00:01:17.770> there<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:19.570> we're<00:01:19.720> going<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
that's it right there now we're going to

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.969 
that's it right there now we're going to
back<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.350> out

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770 

and<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.580> we'll<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> we'll<00:01:27.240> take<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and what we'll do is we'll take that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.880 
and what we'll do is we'll take that
cell<00:01:28.200> anoi<00:01:28.439> down<00:01:33.080> pretty<00:01:34.080> much<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.470> held<00:01:34.710> in

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
cell anoi down pretty much is held in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.740 
cell anoi down pretty much is held in
with<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> couple<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> ten<00:01:35.700> millimeter<00:01:36.119> bolts

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.820 

now<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.080> other<00:01:43.229> side<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:45.830> other

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
now on the other side of this the other

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.090 
now on the other side of this the other
side<00:01:47.039> of<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.340> solenoid<00:01:47.789> there<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:49.070> like<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
side of this solenoid there is a like a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.840 
side of this solenoid there is a like a
plate<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.590> plate<00:01:52.920> hopefully<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
plate and that plate hopefully is not

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.630 
plate and that plate hopefully is not
going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.330> move<00:01:57.679> when<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.830> solenoid<00:01:59.130> comes

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going to move when the solenoid comes

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
going to move when the solenoid comes
down<00:02:02.509> otherwise<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.720> have<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> drop<00:02:04.319> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
down otherwise you have to drop the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.570 
down otherwise you have to drop the
valve<00:02:04.740> body

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:20.170 

to<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.150> plate<00:02:12.420> back<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.870> place

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.470 

okay<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.019> let's<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.489> see<00:02:22.640> if<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:23.000> loosen

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
okay so let's just see if we can loosen

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:34.130 
okay so let's just see if we can loosen
this<00:02:23.720> bracket<00:02:28.989> okay

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110 

alright<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.070> now<00:02:35.160> I'm<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.670> was<00:02:35.880> set

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
alright so now I'm just going to was set

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.620 
alright so now I'm just going to was set
up<00:02:36.150> over<00:02:36.810> by<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.020> bench<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.240> back<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
up over by the bench and be back in a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.400 
up over by the bench and be back in a
minute<00:02:44.750> alright<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.130> we've<00:02:47.130> got<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> voltmeter

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
minute alright so we've got a voltmeter

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.100 
minute alright so we've got a voltmeter
set<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.530> ohms<00:02:49.770> scale<00:02:50.450> here<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> new

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
set on ohms scale here is the new

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.260 
set on ohms scale here is the new
solenoid<00:02:52.650> which<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.340> stuck<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> widely

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
solenoid which I just stuck a widely

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.270 
solenoid which I just stuck a widely
through<00:02:54.510> easier<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.020> check<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.710> here<00:02:56.190> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
through easier to check it and here is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.949 
through easier to check it and here is
the<00:02:56.400> old<00:02:56.580> solenoid<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> let's<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.610> Ohm's

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the old solenoid so let's do this Ohm's

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.850 
the old solenoid so let's do this Ohm's
comparison<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.110> see<00:03:01.200> what<00:03:01.320> we<00:03:01.440> got

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
comparison and see what we got

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.080 
comparison and see what we got
so<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.030> hook<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.390> negative<00:03:03.930> lead

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so I'm going to hook the negative lead

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.600 
so I'm going to hook the negative lead
up<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.390> body<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> solenoid<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.610> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
up to the body of the solenoid and a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.930 
up to the body of the solenoid and a
positive<00:03:09.120> lead<00:03:09.360> here<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.400> new

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
positive lead here and with this new

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.250 
positive lead here and with this new
solenoid<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:16.550> about<00:03:17.550> 16<00:03:18.120> ohms<00:03:18.800> 15.9

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
solenoid we have about 16 ohms 15.9

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.350 
solenoid we have about 16 ohms 15.9
already<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> let's<00:03:23.130> see<00:03:23.310> what<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.610> got<00:03:23.820> switch

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
already and let's see what we got switch

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:47.160 
already and let's see what we got switch
everything<00:03:24.660> over

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.710 

as<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.440> can<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:50.080> solenoid<00:03:51.080> reads<00:03:51.650> open

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
as you can see this solenoid reads open

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.300 
as you can see this solenoid reads open
so<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.349> reason<00:03:54.709> for<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:55.690> p0

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so this is the reason for the p0

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.750 
so this is the reason for the p0
seven-four-zero<00:03:58.310> code<00:04:00.760> okay<00:04:03.400> I'll<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.549> go

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
seven-four-zero code okay I'll just go

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.059 
seven-four-zero code okay I'll just go
back<00:04:04.970> one<00:04:05.150> more<00:04:05.329> time<00:04:05.599> here<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:09.110> then<00:04:09.920> what

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
back one more time here and then what

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.449 
back one more time here and then what
we'll<00:04:10.220> do<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.519> we'll<00:04:10.670> install<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.420> solenoid

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
we'll do is we'll install the solenoid

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.300 
we'll do is we'll install the solenoid
back<00:04:13.459> up<00:04:13.640> in<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.879> car<00:04:14.120> okay<00:04:15.040> all<00:04:16.040> right<00:04:16.160> so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
back up in the car okay all right so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.439 
back up in the car okay all right so
that's<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.579> definite<00:04:16.970> problem

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
that's a definite problem

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.229 
that's a definite problem
we<00:04:17.840> got<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.079> open<00:04:18.410> solenoid<00:04:18.889> we've<00:04:19.220> got<00:04:19.370> 15.9

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
we got the open solenoid we've got 15.9

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.250 
we got the open solenoid we've got 15.9
16<00:04:20.780> ohms<00:04:20.959> okay<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.600> solenoid<00:04:26.960> is

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
16 ohms okay so this solenoid is

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.969 
16 ohms okay so this solenoid is
probably<00:04:27.560> internally<00:04:28.160> shorted<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.710> we're

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
probably internally shorted so we're

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.590 
probably internally shorted so we're
going<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.160> go<00:04:31.280> back<00:04:31.460> over<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.940> car<00:04:32.150> and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
going to go back over to the car and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.090 
going to go back over to the car and
we'll<00:04:32.720> get<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.930> sold<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.229> solenoid<00:04:33.710> plug<00:04:34.010> it

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
we'll get it sold that solenoid plug it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.250 
we'll get it sold that solenoid plug it
in<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.400> button<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.030> trans<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.539> I'll<00:04:36.169> be

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
in and button this trans up I'll be

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.189 
in and button this trans up I'll be
right<00:04:36.500> back

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
right back

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.550 
right back
already<00:04:39.199> got<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.190> new<00:04:40.370> solenoid<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:42.410> going

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
already got the new solenoid I'm going

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:55.720 
already got the new solenoid I'm going
to<00:04:42.650> put<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:42.949> back<00:04:43.010> up<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.610> car

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.439 

okay

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:10.750 

get<00:05:03.050> these<00:05:03.259> boats

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.290 

all<00:05:11.750> right<00:05:11.900> we<00:05:12.020> got<00:05:12.170> lucky<00:05:12.350> that<00:05:12.650> plate<00:05:13.300> didn't

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
all right we got lucky that plate didn't

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.430 
all right we got lucky that plate didn't
move<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:16.300> this<00:05:17.300> will<00:05:17.450> go<00:05:17.600> right<00:05:17.840> in<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:20.480> last

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
move so this will go right in and last

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:47.070 
move so this will go right in and last
one<00:05:22.960> or<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.110> bracket<00:05:24.590> too

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.910 

okay<00:05:48.080> now<00:05:48.230> we're<00:05:48.350> going<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:48.500> plug<00:05:48.710> the

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
okay now we're going to plug the

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:57.160 
okay now we're going to plug the
solenoid<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:55.120> this<00:05:56.120> is<00:05:56.270> going<00:05:56.450> to<00:05:56.510> sit<00:05:56.780> here<00:05:57.110> I

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
solenoid in this is going to sit here I

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.400 
solenoid in this is going to sit here I
just<00:05:57.380> have<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.860> get<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.660> hold<00:05:59.660> down<00:05:59.840> bracket

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
just have to get the hold down bracket

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:20.280 
just have to get the hold down bracket
have<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.460> over<00:06:01.700> by<00:06:01.820> the<00:06:01.880> bench

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:39.150 

okay<00:06:22.200> I'll<00:06:23.200> put<00:06:23.500> this<00:06:23.740> on

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.760 

okaythat's<00:06:40.160> snapped<00:06:40.430> in<00:06:40.610> place<00:06:40.640> and<00:06:41.180> that's<00:06:41.270> a

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
okaythat's snapped in place and that's a

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.190 
okaythat's snapped in place and that's a
really<00:06:42.770> about<00:06:43.130> it<00:06:43.310> this<00:06:44.240> is<00:06:44.480> the<00:06:44.690> pans<00:06:44.960> ready

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
really about it this is the pans ready

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.940 
really about it this is the pans ready
to<00:06:45.320> go<00:06:45.440> back<00:06:45.650> on<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:47.050> put<00:06:48.050> some<00:06:48.230> fresh<00:06:48.410> oil<00:06:48.800> in

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
to go back on and put some fresh oil in

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.390 
to go back on and put some fresh oil in
it<00:06:49.070> and<00:06:50.080> give<00:06:51.080> it<00:06:51.110> a<00:06:51.200> road<00:06:51.380> test<00:06:51.620> and<00:06:52.010> clear<00:06:52.250> the

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
it and give it a road test and clear the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.210 
it and give it a road test and clear the
codes<00:06:52.610> all<00:06:53.540> right<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:53.900> once<00:06:54.110> again<00:06:54.230> 2002

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
codes all right so once again 2002

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.530 
codes all right so once again 2002
