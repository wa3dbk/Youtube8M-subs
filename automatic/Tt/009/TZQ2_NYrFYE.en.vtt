then beta pc games if I slide down here
you'll<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.460> not<00:00:32.669> connected<00:00:33.120> yet

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
you'll see that we are not connected yet

you'll see that we are not connected yet
this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> I've<00:00:34.440> disconnected<00:00:34.770> everything

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
this is a I've disconnected everything

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.740 
this is a I've disconnected everything
just<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> show<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> process<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:36.570> start

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
just to show you the process from start

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380 
just to show you the process from start
to<00:00:36.960> finish<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.800> fast<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.280> goes<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.730> can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to finish and see how fast it goes I can

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
to finish and see how fast it goes I can
tap<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.290> could<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.649> tap<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
tap in here I could just tap it with a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
tap in here I could just tap it with a
as<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.700> by<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> way<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> back

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
as well by the way you see in the back

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.619 
as well by the way you see in the back
on<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> appeared<00:00:44.250> instantaneously<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
on that appeared instantaneously this is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.100 
on that appeared instantaneously this is
connecting<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.379> device<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:48.110> take

connecting one device to the other take

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
connecting one device to the other take
just<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> moment<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.770> connect<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:51.120> we

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just a moment to connect there then we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.610 
just a moment to connect there then we

PC connected with metro last light just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.310 
PC connected with metro last light just
to<00:01:06.180> show<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> there's<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.260> a

to show you that there's just with a
couple<00:01:07.350> examples<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
couple examples I go in with a and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.550 
couple examples I go in with a and
launch<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> pc<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.060> here

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
launch it on the pc as well as here

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.429 
launch it on the pc as well as here
streaming<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:15.689> shows<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.229> little

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
streaming and it shows me this little

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
streaming and it shows me this little
cross<00:01:17.189> section<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.450> i

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
cross section of thing is just because i

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.940 
cross section of thing is just because i
didn't<00:01:18.900> haven't<00:01:19.140> gotten<00:01:19.290> rid<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.619> yet<00:01:19.740> i'll

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
didn't haven't gotten rid of it yet i'll

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
didn't haven't gotten rid of it yet i'll
go<00:01:20.070> ahead<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> tap<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:21.090> rid<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.600> i

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
go ahead and tap get rid of that so i

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
go ahead and tap get rid of that so i
don't<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> ever<00:01:22.350> again<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
don't have to see it ever again and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.880 
don't have to see it ever again and
you'll<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.119> has<00:01:24.150> launched

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you'll see that it has launched

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
you'll see that it has launched
essentially<00:01:25.890> instantaneously<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> now

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
essentially instantaneously and now

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.460 
essentially instantaneously and now
that's<00:01:27.060> connecting<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.600> device<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> pc

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
that's connecting this device to the pc

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.399 
that's connecting this device to the pc

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.510 

whether<00:01:45.940> this<00:01:46.090> audio<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.660> coming<00:01:46.720> through

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
whether this audio is coming through

up<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.610> facing<00:01:51.790> speakers<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.420> guess<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.690> could

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
up to facing speakers I guess you could

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.860 
up to facing speakers I guess you could
say<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:59.020> go<00:01:59.110> in<00:01:59.260> here<00:02:00.360> real<00:02:01.360> quick<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.780> can

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
say I can go in here real quick you can
