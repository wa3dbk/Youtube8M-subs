dehydrator<00:05:20.390> let's<00:05:21.390> just<00:05:21.690> take<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.110> leaves

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
dehydrator let's just take the leaves

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.720 
dehydrator let's just take the leaves
off<00:05:22.760> put<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.090> dehydrator<00:05:24.780> rack<00:05:25.730> make

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
off put it on the dehydrator rack make

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.600 
off put it on the dehydrator rack make
sure<00:05:26.970> they're<00:05:27.210> well<00:05:28.010> apart<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.220> they<00:05:29.340> dry

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
sure they're well apart so they dry

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.990 
sure they're well apart so they dry
evenly<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:31.040> then<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.430> put<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:33.090> dehydrator<00:05:33.990> on

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
evenly and then I put the dehydrator on

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.180 
evenly and then I put the dehydrator on
about<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.030> hundred<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.630> five<00:05:36.870> for<00:05:37.680> maybe<00:05:38.010> an

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
about a hundred and five for maybe an

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.600 
about a hundred and five for maybe an

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
hour and it's totally dry and then I can

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.410 
hour and it's totally dry and then I can
put<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:42.000> right<00:05:42.450> into<00:05:42.780> my<00:05:43.170> jar<00:05:44.090> but<00:05:45.090> when<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.270> was

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
put it right into my jar but when I was

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.700 
put it right into my jar but when I was
a<00:05:45.450> little<00:05:45.750> girl<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:47.150> didn't<00:05:48.150> have<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.360> dehydrator

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
a little girl I didn't have a dehydrator

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.090 
a little girl I didn't have a dehydrator
so<00:05:49.710> we<00:05:50.400> just<00:05:50.640> had<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:50.970> rack<00:05:51.419> in<00:05:51.900> our<00:05:52.140> basement

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
so we just had a rack in our basement

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.600 
so we just had a rack in our basement
like<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.520> like<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> shelf<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:55.320> I<00:05:55.770> put<00:05:56.070> newspaper

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
like a like a shelf and I put newspaper

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.909 
like a like a shelf and I put newspaper
down<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.450> put<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:58.050> mint<00:05:58.290> leaves<00:05:58.530> on<00:05:58.770> the

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
down and I put the mint leaves on the

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.700 
down and I put the mint leaves on the
newspaper<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.700> dried<00:05:59.940> that<00:06:00.210> way<00:06:00.450> or<00:06:01.200> if

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
newspaper and it dried that way or if

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.920 
newspaper and it dried that way or if
you<00:06:01.860> live<00:06:02.100> in<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.310> very<00:06:02.520> humid<00:06:03.030> climate<00:06:03.660> you

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
you live in a very humid climate you

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.740 
you live in a very humid climate you
could<00:06:04.140> put<00:06:04.350> it<00:06:04.440> on<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.590> very<00:06:04.980> low<00:06:05.190> setting<00:06:05.970> in

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
could put it on a very low setting in

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.840 
could put it on a very low setting in
your<00:06:07.290> oven<00:06:08.010> and<00:06:08.480> dry<00:06:09.480> it<00:06:09.540> that<00:06:09.930> way<00:06:10.140> as<00:06:10.410> well

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
your oven and dry it that way as well

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.909 
your oven and dry it that way as well
and<00:06:11.850> then<00:06:12.090> you<00:06:12.270> would<00:06:12.450> just<00:06:12.690> dry<00:06:13.410> these<00:06:13.620> out

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
and then you would just dry these out

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.950 
and then you would just dry these out
and<00:06:14.600> voila<00:06:15.650> you<00:06:16.650> get<00:06:16.770> peppermint<00:06:17.310> tea<00:06:17.960> so

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960
