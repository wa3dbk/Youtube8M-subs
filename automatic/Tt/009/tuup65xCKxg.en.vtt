00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.109
 good 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.390
 good when they are playing multiplayer 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.430
 when a song ends in one or more 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.080
 long notes and give them eggs to be 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.540
 pressing until the end of the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.369
 song just leave pressed the 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.230
 corresponding keys and with the other 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.689
 hand click on the outside of the screen 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.939
 of the flash guitar to one side and it only 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.710
 they press the keys and so they can 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.890
 do with the songs that in the end 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.020
 have long notes recommendation I think 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.630
 what can not be done when you play alone 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 if it will not pause or maybe if it comes out 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.040
 one day it came out 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.480
 this is the first thing that maybe he does 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.550
 lay the foundations playing when 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.800
 soon gives you the guide you shit the game 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.430
 and you start to press all the buttons and 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.430
 you are worth it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 near 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.160
 well this is another one of my 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.010
 discoveries good I do not know if you guys 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.810
 know but it's like getting 0 points already 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.170
 the time you listen to the song on guitar 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.870
 flash without playing it is weird to get 0 points 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.120
 without failing any but good do what 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.640
 that I wrote to you when the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.440
 song they open another tab and that's how 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.440
 you get the trick or as you say 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.140
 when the song ends you 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 only return to the other tab 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 where is the flash guitar and already attention 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 is when the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.390
 song if you will not get the few notes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.390
 end 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.090
 this is the second thing to do when 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.190
 have time playing guitar flash web and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.010
 today as many others leave oppressed 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.420
 the keys when you enter more notes I do not know 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.420
 if you understand me but good 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.420
 these 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.360
 there are many more things that I had planned 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.810
 for this video but I forgot 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.030
 hahaha good I've seen that many guys 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.569
 they leave them oppressed as I think it is 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.569
 habit 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.000
 this I just put it to see if more 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.160
 people gave them sleep this song haha 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.670
 When I finished it, it was already in my bed 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 hahaha XD 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.240
 do not 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.590
 this is your reaction when after 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.750
 so many attempts you beat your record 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.000
 and I tell you that one day I was 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.410
 playing guitar with several batos when 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.410
 suddenly my belly hurt 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.569
 and I lost and they told me I was a fucking 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.260
 novice and they left that's bad luck 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:55.970
 but if I reached the bathroom xd good 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.970
 greetings to my facebook friends
