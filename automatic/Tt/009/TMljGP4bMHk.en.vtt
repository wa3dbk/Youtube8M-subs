00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.750
 in the offers where I grew up with 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.219
 played a lot 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.320
 helia by when i found one of them 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.480
 the fields in the neighborhood 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.670
 I look up to the older boys and 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.720
 except that they do the sports for me again 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.529
 this is especially a lot to me 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.779
 swear words beloved quarrel and bullied 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.519
 how nice would it be if the filters were in 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.080
 the Netherlands would change into places 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.519
 where young people would hear them 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.410
 being appreciated 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.240
 that they may be who they are that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.520
 honesty counts and that they grow up in 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.680
 true relationships and friendship 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.510
 in recent years we have something with it 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.300
 in action seen that when young 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.520
 people through sport is to connect with 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.860
 the people around them and that for a long time 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.530
 and then came back here time and again 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.820
 that lives are actually changing 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.680
 we see life there in the church and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600
 arise where peace and the inside 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.400
 walk in but didn't sneak in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.260
 and where so 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.570
 Christians are able to live their lives 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.910
 share and share some of the love 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.320
 from jesus they received themselves 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.780
 they do that in confusion and they do it in 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.150
 acts they do in their sports 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.159
 and that's how we see that living church 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.390
 sport can entertain a difference in it 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.399
 The Netherlands 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 we want that concept in the coming years 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.450
 just continue to expand and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.659
 go through thinking and make it deeper 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.280
 so that the church in the Netherlands actually 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.039
 can make a difference because we 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.740
 believe they are called to that and do sports 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.179
 To me, community is it 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.039
 Church volunteer team along with 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.539
 the youngsters from the neighborhood and community 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.189
 and that the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.899
 what the community is where jesus 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.359
 is central and where we all have more 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.900
 move towards jesus and so together 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.150
 pull up to god 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 because we are active in the neighborhood every week 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.140
 they know what is going on in the neighborhoods 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.430
 know what goes on in millions of children 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.380
 should 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.530
 and what particularly changed in this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.570
 municipality is that we are very small with 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.400
 my few children in the beginning are now 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.590
 become the sport ministry in 2 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 neighborhoods is active and also with young people 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.400
 and program and with girls 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.780
 we see people changing towards jesus 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.910
 we see people who live on jesus 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.280
 and therefore also on part of us 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.510
 team therefore also become other people 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.460
 about jesus' we will tell see 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 people being baptized and on that 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.959
 jesus' way so that we follow 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 actually see that happen is the the 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.610
 church the threshold to the church that is gone 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
 And people feel free to go to this one 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.760
 church 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.250
 my intention is that many churches 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.050
 will be relevant in their area by 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.270
 means of sport ministry 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 and thus lower the threshold 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.300
 to see the church and jesus with it 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.260
 the place where God put them here all 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.569
 change in the power of it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.099
 Gospel is meant to speed things up 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.730
 it does not have its exime on the churches 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.739
 the netherlands to build sport minutes 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.409
 that's why we are looking for a younger one 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.959
 one dedicate it as Paul and the teenagers 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.420
 and young people in their neighborhood 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.580
 not to exercise for an afternoon at my 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.610
 to share live so gospel visible 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.819
 and you will feel gas kingdoms 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.819
 neighborhood
