00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.270
 hello very good friends in the video of 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.089
 Today I'm going to show you where we can 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.829
 find the fat the firm and also 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.919
 where to find the delivery guy 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.990
 experience well first thing we're going to 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:22.789
 see where to find the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.539
 the firm arm or serious male 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:30.410
 what it does is give us twice as many 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.440
 points of eps when we are forming 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.630
 these points is to say that if it's lou 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.620
 brock gives us a hp point 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.970
 with the firm arm you will give us two points 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.310
 this is a very important tool 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.520
 since it allows us to climb in a way 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.620
 faster the points of eps well what 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.420
 first thing we're going to do is direct 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 directly towards 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.730
 vermilion city 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.260
 a vermilion city version we should go 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.799
 towards a square that is towards 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.979
 the right of the dílar cave 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.979
 we went through here 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 this box here 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.810
 We walked up the stairs and once 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.799
 the staircase we will find the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.220
 teacher assistant and we talk to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.259
 him and he will not ask for an amount of 30 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.509
 pokemon to give us the search engine 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.860
 objects the object finder is this 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.860
 that I have this item here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 so once with him we can already 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 get what is the macho grace hours 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.300
 at last 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 all right 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.220
 now we are heading towards 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.869
 meridian city 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.580
 once in see ians and pti we go 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.400
 directly to the pokemon gym 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.790
 in this gym is where yoani is 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.119
 once he has been defeated he will continue 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.119
 this place 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.950
 and there we have to take advantage of us and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.790
 get the object that is here 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.670
 all right 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.280
 once where they were and we have 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.849
 in the same place in the exact place 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.790
 Where was it and we will use the search engine 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.630
 of objects well me if I use it not to do 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.630
 nothing because I already have it 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 but here is the arm to the firm 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.070
 is a very important tool to the 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.070
 time to upload the points from eps 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 so well once with arms firm 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 we would need to find the delivery guy 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.150
 experience for the delivery guy 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.460
 experience what we should do is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.550
 direct us to 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.930
 the fuchsia city where he is 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.379
 the safari once here 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.290
 we go to the right and enter 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.000
 a box identical to the one we entered 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.400
 We previously climbed the stairs 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.790
 and we will find another assistant of the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.000
 teachers we talk to him and he's going to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.430
 order a total of 50 pokemon to give us 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.430
 the experience dealer 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.690
 once we have this amount of 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.770
 pokemon experience forgiveness we can already 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.840
 get elite 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.780
 well this item is one of the most 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.760
 important when training the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.640
 eb points and upload experience already 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.060
 that as the name says the pokemon 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.930
 who has it equipped 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.090
 and will win half the experience 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.470
 of combat so it's a very 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.990
 quick to upload a low level Pokémon 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.270
 and another particularity that it has is that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.990
 also allows us to raise the points of 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.390
 eps ie I in this case I have the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.190
 I'm in to enter to fight first 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.010
 therefore if we wanted 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.170
 against one here 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.240
 and here is going to give us a point to play 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.160
 two points in attack 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.160
 the eps then 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.280
 As our brightness has experience it 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.529
 has shared experience what does not 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.289
 only share the experience but give it 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:51.279
 a point on the 'stand' that we are 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.700
 going up in this case attack well I would 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.400
 I'm going to show 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.880
 to believe me 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.230
 I for example if I put a good one in this 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.890
 case 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.890
 It's me 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.490
 no bully exit 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.120
 now let's do the example with the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.910
 pse king 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.510
 if I get another pokemon 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.280
 a slow pot is what gives us a point in 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:25.190
 hp therefore and if we kill a slow pop 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:31.370
 we would have to give a point d 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.590
 April and as you see has risen from 3 to 4 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.140
 so shared experience is a 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.810
 very important milestone when it comes to forming 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.810
 these points since it allows us 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.950
 upload two pokemons at once good 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.010
 friends I hope you have been a lot 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.310

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.290
