00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.309
 we have gone ahead so that you see the 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.460
 complete process from start to finish 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.280
 we have the piloncillo honey ready for 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.210
 be used in a way that I change this 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.850
 for here and I'm going to give it a low fire for 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.920
 that goes cooking also here is 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 the piloncillo honey and here I make my 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 final preparation I'm going to do 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.890
 I'm just going to put vegetable shortening 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.699
 I find it impressive in some 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.880
 countries do not know the shortening well 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:44.200
 that I present to you 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.020
 this is something like a hydrogenated oil 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.080
 has water then becomes not 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.630
 butter but vegetable shortening will 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.970
 I say because there are some questions between 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.220
 on the internet in relation to what is a 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.220
 vegetable shortening and is that they speak of 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.150
 other countries who do not know so 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.280
 here we have it we are going to be processing 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 somehow true giving it volume 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.340
 to this shortening that we use it 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.340
 in empanaditas we use them 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.130
 institute of cookies in any type 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.509
 of desserts then I also find 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.170
 what for to expand is very 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.170
 used 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.810
 until 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.460
 I'm going to lay the eggs 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.720
 and I will incorporate 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.740
 I'm going to prepare half 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.450
 the ingredients for something so 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.030
 traditional I'll put a pinch of salt 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.030
 keep beating but at the same time I'm going 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.030
 gradually integrate cornmeal 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.439
 I will alternate from then 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.710
 and here I will incorporate 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.710
 the ingredients 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.800
 again I will put 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.500
 the bus live in commercial fiber 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.750
 look at how we are left with a 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.750
 very good consistency 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.930
 about half a kilogram I'm going to 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.930
 put my kilograms 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.400
 so I hope not to disappoint channel knows 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.280
 that my husband's family told him 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:49.300
 but he has mobility to be doing 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.850
 a beauty based on this mine that were 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.880
 incredible in all the risks of 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.420
 our sinaloa are without cookies like this 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.200
 is that I'm going to remove it 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.810
 and the cookie is ready to be formed 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:11.650
 and I'm going to take this and I have to 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.750
 stay like this I 'm not going to oil the mold 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.420
 I'm just going to 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.010
 to mix the flour perfectly 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.550
 I have to stay 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:29.320
 this way I'll make balls 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.910
 well we say the size of the nut is 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:38.530
 truth every person has the size 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.840
 we want to oppress you remember not 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.050
 We greased the tray because this 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.940
 already has a lot of fat we go to the oven 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.910
 we open the oven that is preheated 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.120
 previously and we're going to put in a part 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.940
 from the middle look how they are separated 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.419
 because they are still going to expand a little 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.569
 we leave them there at 200 degrees centigrade 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:07.280
 about 12 to 15 minutes that 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.280
 you had golden brown take out the
