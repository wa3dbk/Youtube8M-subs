00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.620
 my friends how are they taking advantage of this 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.930
 moment to share with you a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 tip about a disease that is well 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.860
 catastrophic as cancer and we have 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 knowledge of the usual handling by 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.460
 part of us doctors who have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.199
 what to do with chemotherapy the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.030
 radiotherapy surgery and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.980
 mixed treatments between these 3 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.710
 in the type of medical treatments 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 we want to share something very interesting 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.580
 today at the nutritional level the science in 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.840
 general and nutritional has developed 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.850
 very high quality elements like this 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.270
 that we are seeing here the use that 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.670
 they allow to generate interesting things 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.370
 its soybean content of oat corn 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.340
 niacin rice zinc mine 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.590
 antioxidant vitamins and so on 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 etcetera of the same selenium make the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.710
 product reinforce in such a way the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.079
 immune system 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.940
 cell doctor who performed 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.340
 remain in cells here that is in the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.110
 lymphocyte of phagocytotic t lymphocytes 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.110
 neutrophil macrophages et cetera etcetera 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.750
 which are elements within the area 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.600
 defensive of the high impact organism 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.930
 and what we are generating are two things 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800
 one prevention improvements that would be what 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.170
 most important and very powerful effects 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.330
 in therapeutic management or be the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.119
 results regarding the disease the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.470
 use is a product that based on all 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.840
 your elements that I commented to you now 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.520
 that allows the body to reinforce 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.979
 immensely your immune system in 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.679
 all the areas that I shared now 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.929
 with shocking results from the 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.649
 point of view from a point of view 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.080
 doctor an important thing do not exist in 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.210
 no type of communication in the use 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.409
 immensely reinforces the system 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.539
 immunological reinforces 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.579
 or better avoid the side effects of 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.969
 the other therapies that are not seen 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.259
 suspend initially and the other thing is 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.850
 that makes the chemistry of the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 radiotherapy can suffer an effect 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 much more valuable in the sense also 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.869
 therapeutic in the sense of healing of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.869
 the disease we have a product that goes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.849
 to strengthen the body's defenses and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.160
 that will change the quality outright 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.690
 of the patient and his longevity is 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040
 basically what I can share 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.220
 Quickly regarding the product 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.349
 because what would be the difference more 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.209
 important between this product and 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.610
 any other nutrient on the market 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.129
 but there is no market 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.410
 nutrient with this type of design that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.750
 allow to generate for example messengers 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.860
 that make the prosthesis effective 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.450
 the place that cell death 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.950
 programmed then that all the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.019
 cells are programmed to live 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.599
 determined time from a week to 120 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.010
 days 200 days et cetera etcetera but for 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.109
 poor nutrition and excess 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.239
 toxicity that in the environment is not 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.150
 they can form these genetic messengers 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.690
 just like the other cells the cell 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.360
 salical interferon in the sacs and cough 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.910
 etcetera etcetera and the product if 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.950
 ago been remember if it helps generate 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.290
 this type of type elements of 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 defensive-type substances that are going 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.260
 to allow as I said now 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.600
 radically change the history of 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 sick patient not only in the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.560
 prevention but also the process 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.840
 healing in the therapeutic process 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.170
 thank you very much because it is something much 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 same
