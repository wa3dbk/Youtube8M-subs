basically the same idea you got to start
with<00:00:21.329> some<00:00:21.829> alcohol<00:00:22.829> that's<00:00:23.699> been<00:00:24.439> distilled

with some alcohol that's been distilled

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.630 
with some alcohol that's been distilled
filtered<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.820> watered<00:00:27.419> down<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:28.159> 40<00:00:29.159> probably

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
filtered and watered down to 40 probably

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.579 
filtered and watered down to 40 probably
forty<00:00:29.939> five<00:00:30.179> percent<00:00:30.210> after<00:00:31.079> all<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
forty five percent after all the

forty five percent after all the
filtering<00:00:33.050> first<00:00:34.050> off<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:34.890> some

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
filtering first off you got to get some

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.390 
filtering first off you got to get some
oak<00:00:35.700> chips<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.590> your<00:00:37.740> chips<00:00:38.190> from
