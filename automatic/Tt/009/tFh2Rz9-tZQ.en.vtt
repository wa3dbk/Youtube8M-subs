00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.480
 okay with you today to come here 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.490
 make a tutorial super cool for you 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.219
 one of the most fun tutorials I 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.530
 I've done one of the most time - consuming the most 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.810
 but also one of the 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.640
 the most beautiful in the world is what I most 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.590
 I loved the result of everything I've ever done 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.830
 This is for you, that's what I'm more or less. 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.740
 result that was this beautiful wall that 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.870
 hq people comic book one 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.910
 guy you want to talk to then 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.510
 If you want to learn well with me 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 I teach you step by step to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.769
 to start you will need the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.649
 comic books and white glue 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.170
 then you will dilute the white glue and 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.210
 in a pot with water 12 copies of glue 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.449
 for each glass of water I made in the base 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.100
 of the olhÃ´metro itself and just do not let 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.050
 very liquid because it makes a lot of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.479
 mess but getting liquid worries us 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.760
 because it works the same way 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.370
 Before we started, I got the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.260
 some pages of magazines you had 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.990
 I glued it with a tape even on the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.940
 wall just to visualize how it would look 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.740
 so make the student see you 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.670
 if it will look cool on the wall you 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.380
 to choose 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.259
 So people, we're going to start now. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 then pass misturinha glue and water 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.409
 on the wall it goes like this to koffke 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 They know how I have wooden face I 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.479
 I had to get through screaming too 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.850
 he then just choose the side of the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.119
 sheet you want and pasting the list 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.759
 well, she looks so cute and does 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.520
 be careful not to get ugly 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.520
 so just go in the glue and paste it 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.930
 for who has a wooden house only to do 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.820
 there, the way I do it 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.259
 making pretty good guarantees 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.259
 It will look good and done too. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 and now after you've put you go 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 pass the glue mixer again and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 over water because this will help to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 fix the leaves better and will also 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.640
 help the mother telma and permeabilized 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.620
 better in them 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 so it's just going to do on the whole wall 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.370
 now be careful it makes a little bit 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 small at a time will not pass glue 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.990
 across the wall then make one with 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.750
 careful let's make a little bit 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.400
 step a little glue sticks some and goes 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.320
 doing so because it will be okay 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.050
 You better work will be fine 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.150
 more handsome also tries and fit the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 leaves some of my magazines 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.290
 had much larger leaves than the others 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.030
 so my tip you try 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
 buy all the same 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.650
 size I did not see it just this after 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.480
 that I was sticking then my tip 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.150
 It's up to you to choose and magazines that have 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.800
 the same size but mine worked out 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.050
 neither do we, only you know 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.540
 fit them and do not forget to 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.760
 glue over again now a 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.470
 The tip that I'm going to give you is home. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.820
 It seems that you have chosen to have taken 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.820
 Something like that 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.730
 so you go there medina more 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.180
 or less like I did and cut the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.650
 little piece that will be left over and there it is 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.450
 just collar fit 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.580
 It's very easy, we do not have a secret. 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.470
 none to do the other side there I 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.200
 I took the little paper I had cut from 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.110
 another cached on the sheet and cut out for 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.110
 stay right then just paste the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.070
 another also to make the bottom part 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:43.440
 same mean thing and scratches with ap 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.440
 if you find it easier and reap 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.830
 done it so it 's right it goes 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.040
 To be very handsome there, just pass the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.540
 ball over again and then people already 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.540
 I was with half the wall made 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.140
 So, it's always going to be a little bit 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.360
 going to spend a little more time 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.160
 and puts the other 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:20.180
 It's a lot easier, we made it demanding. 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:23.300
 It was much more practical and there is something 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.670
 we are when you pass the glue and by 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.890
 up the leaves they give an excited 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.480
 she made herself transparent 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.670
 looks like the drawing on the other side 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.770
 of the leaf but after it dries them 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.690
 I'm serious, I thought. 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.580
 it would be wrinkled and then dried 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.920
 they look good durinha cells with 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 neighbors and it does not look like the 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.360
 on the other side so do not despair 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.430
 when you're making her 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.040
 She's going to get ready. She's going to be fine, yes. 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.870
 that I scored a lot in that match 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.050
 for you to see right for the piece 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.570
 king on the body and on the wall did not 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.850
 after it dried it looked pretty good and 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.470
 so do not be desperate for her 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.850
 in one place and this is the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.340
 end result, we got very 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.460
 Gorgeous, it worked hard but really. 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.480
 It was really worth it because it was beautiful 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.370
 too much 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.740
 So have patience is a little 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.630
 a little time consuming but this one 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.070
 end result is worth it 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.070
 because he looks very beautiful 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.090
 Shooting how simple it is Easy you just go 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.669
 They need the comics and that charge here 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.800
 only this does not need anything else i think 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.540
 that the long yes in 13 people because it was 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.270
 very cheap the things I bought 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.449
 and a comic book it yields a lot if 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.000
 You know and fixing it yields 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.710
 quite and what I liked most about this 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.690
 tutorial people I have been for a long time 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.020
 wanted to bring things down to 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.340
 all the audiences you watch here 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.610
 that I know there are some boys who 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.639
 follow me and I end up doing tutorials 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.139
 for girls and he 's quite upset 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.120
 with that I wanted to do more things than 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.830
 in this period all audiences 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.770

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.550
 For the child, give it to a girl. Give it to me. 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.949
 You can give it to everyone and I love it. 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.110
 other people like me, I want to 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.210

 I just loved it and I liked it a lot 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.150
 of the result with the last video that I 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.250
 I recorded it at the front and did not go back to 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.849
 to record in the videos I think 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.800
 I'm going to record, but I really hope that 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.440
 You liked it if you did. 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.539

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.580
 I wish I chose not to heat it or because 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.099
 has a meaning for me is one thing 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.990
 which I like when I was younger 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.330
 When I entered 5th grade I did two 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.130
 White specks on hair and a friend 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.410
 my cozy of madness because of the 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.900
 Vampira , I do not even think so. 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:57.770
 falling in love but at the time I 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.270
 just watched drawing everything else and then 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.340
 choose things that you really 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.430
 They have to put up with the moniker. 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.780
 Yesterday,
