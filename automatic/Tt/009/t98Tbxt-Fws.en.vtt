00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.840
 basic movement of rise and fall of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.639
 hip with the feet parallel to the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.490
 height of the hips and from my 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.400
 basic position the loose knee now 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.070
 what I do is work from the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.460
 movement of the knees alternating 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.050
 one shorter than the other doing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.680
 force against the ground so that the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.820
 hip rise and fall alternately 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.650
 it is a movement that after giving it 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 speed we get 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.870
 the movement of chi minh 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.000
 so characteristic of oriental dance 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.760
 first very important to keep your 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.449
 corrected pelvis do not work back and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 from there being more comfortable closed 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.590
 maximum at the height of the hips 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.470
 we alternate the movement of the knees 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.750
 sometimes it's hard to work it 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.990
 little bit quicker so you 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 I recommend that you use slow music 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.420
 or that you concentrate on taking it 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.500
 slowly but with the same rhythm before 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.840
 of wanting to give the speed once 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 I have well worked the movement 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.860
 to take a little faster is 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.159
 produces a small vibration in the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 hip 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:36.200
 when I have worked the sim and the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 Next step would be to try to move 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 the weight change only one leg 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 the other to the tip of the foot and to the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.700
 Heel and centered always know where 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 I have the weight of the body once 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.270
 I have worked the weight changes the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.759
 next step would be this same 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 vibration transferred with movements 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.610
 basic 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 with the pendulum 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.800
 with the twist 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.240
 then you can draw you can walk
