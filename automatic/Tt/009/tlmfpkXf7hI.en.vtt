and I would think that if I could get a

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.310 
and I would think that if I could get a
group<00:06:09.240> of<00:06:09.330> friends<00:06:09.390> in<00:06:09.780> there<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.960> group<00:06:10.230> of

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
subscribers in there because during bow

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.920 
subscribers in there because during bow
before<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:12.030> would<00:06:12.180> play<00:06:12.300> with<00:06:12.330> subs<00:06:12.690> all<00:06:12.840> the
