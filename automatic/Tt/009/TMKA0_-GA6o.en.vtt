nubira just a double check with these
top<00:00:17.970> mounting<00:00:18.960> pins<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.310> see

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
top mounting pins here as you can see

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
top mounting pins here as you can see
these<00:00:20.640> ones<00:00:20.880> around<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.260> another

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
these ones around and there is another

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
these ones around and there is another
type<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.130> fits<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> new<00:00:23.789> beer<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
has square type mounts on the top so

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.279 
has square type mounts on the top so
that<00:00:27.179> would<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.599> first<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.109> just

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that would just be the first thing just

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.419 
that would just be the first thing just
to<00:00:28.349> quickly<00:00:28.560> check<00:00:28.859> whether<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.160> has<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to quickly check whether it has the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.700 
to quickly check whether it has the
round<00:00:29.580> or<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> square<00:00:30.300> type<00:00:30.539> mounts<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.589> we

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
round or the square type mounts but we

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.330 
round or the square type mounts but we
do<00:00:31.830> carry<00:00:32.130> both<00:00:33.440> okay<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> front<00:00:35.160> here

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
do carry both okay from the front here

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
do carry both okay from the front here

into the engine you would see on the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.809 
into the engine you would see on the
right<00:01:40.259> hand<00:01:40.469> side<00:01:40.649> you've<00:01:41.249> got<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.549> small
