00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.409
 after a gestation period of almost four years that finally arrived on 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.859
 European shelves will make fantasy crystal chronicles the crystal bay 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.289
 the exclusive Nintendo Wii title will be available starting February 5th 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.769
 unfortunately good 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.790
 the store line of the crystal bearers take is 100 years between them 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 among the old and new episodes of crystal chronicles in which technology 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.170
 placed permanently abandoned in favor of magic 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.510
 the rather tense lara of which the title is placed is placed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.110
 bhe advent of the so-called crystal bearers 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.860
 human beings with special magic gifts given gross odds 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.190
 crystals present in their body 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.450
 considered outcasts many crystal bearers including protagonist are 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.290
 forced to work as mercenaries to make a living developing in this way 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.600
 no attachment to money that a refuge for human beings is Tuscan 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.110
 the story initially rather vaporous 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 we will begin with the passing of hours by meeting new characters who 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.230
 especially with the changing character of the protagonist ibisevic was finally ai 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.030
 classical canons of the bonis marco 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.620
 ditto for crystal bearers like that of the other episodes belonging to the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.150
 crystal chronicles series is completely different from the classic turn-based rpg 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 this episode in particular introduces a new system of controls almost 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.090
 totally entrusted to him or it will serve primarily as a pointer for 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 harness the power of line 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.500
 from a structural point of view, the adventure can be divided 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.950
 substantially three sections 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.330
 the first of the three phases are the minigames 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.030
 small section with very different time frames in which we will have to solve 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.370
 an unexpected using the peculiarities of the uimo 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.900
 among the first we mention for example a chase on the back of the chocolate boh 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.310
 during which break down trees and piles of narrow stones say 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.569
 the tracker to reach us 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.900
 these phases in most cases almost completely guided police headquarters 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.569
 leaving the player very minimal role 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.610
 sophisticated scallops of fun at a value very next year zero 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.779
 the second section 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:25.569
 and the exploratory ones during which we will come across some sections from 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.370
 platforms studied in a rather intelligent way if porn involved 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.929
 almost never the player's viability 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.630
 especially in the presence of enough openness 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.660
 the lack of the classic compass of a recent mini-ivy any 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.450
 screen indication that I let the player know which one is next 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.099
 goal takes exploration sometimes frustrating 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.219
 to this is added a reviewable management of the camera 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.739
 that goes hand in hand with inaccuracy of the controls during the collection phase e 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.429
 the use of objects 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:57.979
 in the last instance let us remember sporadic fighting entirely carried by the 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.099
 already mentioned aiming system by ulmo 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.519
 the possibilities in these cases are mainly two 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.250
 puntarelle micol raise them throw earth until his death 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.030
 or pick up items from the ground catch the pine dream catchers 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.379
 from military 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.290
 an exception the only one able to put our life to the test and to make ourselves 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.489
 to exploit all the powers of lainate constituted by the capable boxes fortunately 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.489
 to commit ourselves as we fight in bad a true rpg 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.909
 the technical department of fara fantasy crystal chronicles the crystal bearers 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.879
 it exults comparing the most recent panorama more than discreet 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.300
 the polygonal models of the characters appear well made as well as the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.949
 animations that characterize the movement 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.600
 also convincing interior modeling 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.619
 thanks to a particular structure and architecturally pleasing 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:50.839
 the situation regarding very bare and non-bare exteriors is decidedly different 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.089
 equally characterized 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:57.050
 painful notes also with regard to the texturing of the elements 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.090
 which seems far too neglected and unconvincing in every aspect of the game 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.949
 fortunately a good chromatic choice 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.709
 some fragmented effects in the media intelligent management of effects 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.689
 lighting 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.199
 fish will soon forget free access at a glance of much 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.149
 of external arenas 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.709
 absolutely in the media the environmental samples accompanied by 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.759
 a very respectable soundtrack is from a very nice English dubbing to 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 which was accompanied by equally good Italian translation 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.430
 a pretty intriguing story and the good characterization of the characters 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.410
 of some interesting ideas in the game mechanics 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.120
 they are not enough to make people close their eyes about flaws 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.780
 in the implementation of the commands 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.639
 and above all concerning a dimple that remains without discounts 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.759
 and key bossi patto the party never fails to really capture attention of the 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.060
 player on balance that of the crystal bearers is not a rejection 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.560
 malnate station of mediocrity creams of the last effort square-enix 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.460
