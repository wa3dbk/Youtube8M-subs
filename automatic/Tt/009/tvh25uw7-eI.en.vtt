00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.060
 Hello dear and welcome here 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 to a new series on ranking 107 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.810
 You may already have that in intro 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.119
 seen or read now in the title 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.960
 we will take care of this new one now 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.789
 tutorial row everything around redstone 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 Implementation We will design machines 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.050
 if you are with those tutorial row then 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.579
 all learning so what first one 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.350
 Begin to know business structure 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 how to get redstone you see 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 example in this video and later 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.440
 videos then we show right again 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.539
 Complex machines with bridgestone will 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.660
 and it is also here very eager 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.640
 is that again that's how we are going to be 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 Do not head your head first 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.969
 show how to death rats at all 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.710
 get and then it will be later 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.870
 difficult we will be using a lift 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.269
 Rice and beans are enough for what we do 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.630
 First, have fun with the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.909
 first part two redstone 's rescue 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 now you can find it at a height of 1 to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 9 10 lay over the bed 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.829
 it usually comes close to laverton 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.380
 in front 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.390
 but it is also quite common elsewhere 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.939
 distributed in the world and could that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.600
 best with an iron bar or 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.060
 even higher if you get that off 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 her four to five redstone doing that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 get out later you block or 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.210
 Just sink to the bottom and do it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 exciting circuits bonn cologne and now 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.320
 we look first make something of it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 can 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 Salvation can be found in many different ways 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 variants process, for example, one 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.119
 redstone torch what that redstone 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.409
 torch is and how is the strength see 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 you just what that redstone torch 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.399
 you will learn this later 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.380
 You can then turn redstone torches again 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.840
 further processing to redstone repeater 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.079
 the forces are as below 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.090
 stone then a redstone and here still 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.399
 two redstone color already gets one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 unit to the chapter of this delayed 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.289
 a signal but as I said more 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.940
 information with another tutorials 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.740
 a switch you can like the name 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.260
 already says switching on or off 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.080
 you use the following brands 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.670
 cobblestone and open a stick too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.099
 A dispens has something to do with tradition 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.080
 Do this dispenser crafted one 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.550
 dÃ¼rftet follows her as was 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.769
 know but as I said a beginner 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.690
 tutorial and therefore cited so does 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.220
 you ski these slopes or no runs 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.230
 home slopes but that's what you do 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 this dispenser and from this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 dispenser could if there in Retzow 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.349
 Signal on it, so to speak, conducts something 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.950
 have to spit out quite handy for 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.989
 to dye 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.120
 Now we come to another very 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.069
 Redstone important component namely the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.190
 the slopes of this force itself 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.620
 Here below, two cables 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.409
 stone were here again redstone 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.450
 and above all, wood 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.159
 logical 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.610
 amazon just lays with one 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.780
 right-click on the earth 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.030
 we can actually do that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 only do that if there before you 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.780
 switch sits on her 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.790
 company parties and him too 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.129
 he has right-click again 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.480
 only a range of about 15 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.040
 blogs after that must be a repeater 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.590
 when used as an extension 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.349
 is a bet and always serves torches 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 as a permanent change from evil you can 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.129
 on almost all blocks set up 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.690
 glass and plust a redstone signal 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.239
 can also be through the super 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.430
 new tripwire wuxi in version 1.3 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.659
 were added trigger 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.580
 Here it looks if it is for me now 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.409
 it will run for a moment 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.239
 redstone automatically activated when 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.430
 behind a blog behind so behind 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.349
 this 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.299
 whatever that means here and there 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.790
 then have a headline solves that 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.079
 redstone also on page 19 version 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.239
 you can also do a repeater with one 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.069
 Block drive from the side 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.560
 as you can see here chips is 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.269
 another small lever in front of it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.760
 the effects of redstone torches 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.829
 With the latter factors, you can do a lot 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.780
 a lot of things are just here 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.250
 couple of small plug tips and that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.810
 you can for one if you this 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.340
 switch flips and the doctor torch 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.750
 a block is also set up 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.030
 one of the ten times the clear and 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.510
 commander rex is indeed true 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.680
 So you see activated disabled yet 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.449
 Now I show you what they are made of 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.160
 this combination of activated and 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.229
 can do disabled and that way 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.539
 you do not have a tower you build 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.590
 by just chats and blogs and blogs 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.020
 then as I said a disaster 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.030
 his blog and his raps again 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 expires and so on and so forth 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.389
 this rescue tray religion the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.330
 Objectified this becomes the torch and 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.710
 Komarek continues the whole drama and 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.810
 we build that as well as until 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.539
 To type we have so here 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.370
 and bake it out here if we can 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.900
 now press the button once 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 Fantasy is activated and for that 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.680
 disables these puzzles 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.449
 at the end you can then nor any 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.460
 nice light on it we put it 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.659
 command erection made above and then 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.150
 you already have that right now 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.800
 first application example where to puzzle 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.050
 how nice to use can seen 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.240
 that's how it all looks and activates 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.070
 the whole time now with the button 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.610
 because it shines so it takes short in 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.440
 refeldfeld hesitate the whole and how they 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.080
 That's why we recommend you when 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.480
 we'll explain the system to you 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.320
 the same as the lower works already seem 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.960
 in front of our little pilot you 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.980
 See this is the ticket system it 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.310
 sounds a bit strange 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.480
 the system will draw the delay 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.530
 the duo similar maybe you have 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.690
 ever in physics and this 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.580
 Resistance learned in the circuit Yes 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.530
 minecraft is quite in this respect 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.650
 similarly , there are these 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.530
 sticks system of this text tmn arises 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.760
 by the repeater a tick is one 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.860
 Very short delay worth 2 34 ticks 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.050
 even more so 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.080
 a normal tenant just like that 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.510
 a peter here, so to speak 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880
 kick if you trigger it now 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.370
 Here's a tick delay why we do that 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.940
 have someone off again so now 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.670
 Let's try a tick you see blog blog 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.730
 delay so, then stays charged 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.560
 the light is very nice, it goes 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.060
 really fast so a tick is still 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.520
 not much now we come 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.860
 for two ex ex is me here, yes 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.630
 it takes a bit longer 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.150
 So 2 ticks are more 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.430
 and these ticks created a respective 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:28.170
 set rapider and then early 30 40 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.100
 I would not tick tick like that 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.880
 tick so why is it correct and at 3 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.490
 Ticks see commander shepard so be it 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.860
 is already slowly disappearing again 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.289
 and here's 46 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.139
 you see it takes the longest 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:47.310
 a longer tick combination is possible 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.520
 really only get out of nowhere 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.370
 more wolf-peter stringing together dongo 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.159
 can one multiply this text and 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.259
 whoever is capable of computing belongs to her 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.729
 already recognized how many texts 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.620
 I have since just once not counted 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:06.689
 he was not so sure about that himself 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.069
 but I put a switch and now 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.490
 a delay really right 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.860
 seen 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.259
 You can tell it's extremely sketchy now 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.419
 we'll go torch after his rescue if 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:19.250
 That's why it makes a small 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:24.490
 Delay and within one 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:26.110
 ticket times here and you see disposal 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.169
 so that 's it too 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.410
 Thick system like that and it should 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:34.530
 have been losing for the first time 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:36.669
 bridgestone tutorials it will be natural 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.250
 demanding work that only in the 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.470
 next we live here komarek 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.199
 has eagerly worked with during the 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.870
 rescue spits and tonic and rekorde 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.240
 not so bad I'm happy 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.460
 I follow me to the next one 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.050
 also saying goodbye hope of then 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.240
 we will already be difficult winds 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.949
 Quick referrals again 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.659
 turn to redstone I thank that 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:03.030
 He watched taxis and until the next 

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:03.030
 video from 10 07
