00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.270
 ideapad's gratons were seriously injured thomas knows 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.350
 that she played on the phone on her hospital bed in australia listen to the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 its the impressive testimony 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.839
 when he listens to the netherlands and finland we learn that in the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.839
 airports elsewhere in the region have approved by parliament 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.030
 I absolutely remember everyone 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 as soon as the camera embarked on the battle 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.020
 and I'm going for the current europe the relay unfortunately has unfortunately 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.390
 or at night when I'm in the dark and will count 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.160
 by the fed will wait the shutter the engine and the gearbox that was and 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.180
 is detached from the car that was driving next to mandating a bit a picture 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.810
 hp is real 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 the authors of the attacked by the parliament we can currently find 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.930
 a week later it's true that some progress may have happened 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.410
 first five days to prepare quietly because of big fat 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.560
 headache 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.940
 constant dweller all their democrats absolutely no lack of 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.370
 remember the dangers of the economy including the calendar 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.800
 It's a shame 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.840
 briefcase 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 the cafe theater right foot there I have a little after 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.750
 the head duo who grinds four trials part of the hip 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 also the left shoulder that is elected 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.800
 bill them 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.960
 and the greens so he can touch he has a lot of calls that really has me 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 confronted himself and visitors when other years 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.510
 a lot of pilots hill with the club 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.610
 elias richard bank who passed 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.580
 for a lot of pilots a lot of their team the water with the guys the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.460
 good contacts are not made 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 but I think to find my family is ok 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.730
 it's going to help me a member about novel was not telling to be that 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.230
 everyone's points 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.230
 he did not like her at all show them the fangs 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.570
 this is a moment when you have to remember that nintendo had already 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.580
 been excellent and in the same place last year he is right now 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 even back in France so he went home in the Vosges and he has 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.730
 decided 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.490
 to stop the competition then according to their team two choreographers 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.710
 and the amount cashed a deceleration of 80 8% 10 thousandths 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.700
 second when the mitsubishi struck weapons at 160 km 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.280
 and yet the car resisted how the crews 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.380
 can they survive such shocks what are the security elements 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.410
 on the wrc these modern rally cars the answer with thomas smet 4 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.009
 8:18 pm at the road exit 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.519
 there is so much to do for your opinion 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.269
 the pilot in France 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.939
 in the last step towards the vast ensemble 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.309
 the parties at fault 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.849
 outright 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.069
 no data analysis so as to continue as if nothing had happened with 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.289
 a fortune that is changing 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.959
 they are young and didier françois duval to finish his race in the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.119
 trees 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.599
 the act forty-eight hours after daniel gratalon the Belgian was at his 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.159
 ride leads to the hospital 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.849
 without serious injury 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.380
 which saved two match points to play the others but this hoop of 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.370
 security 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 iran wrc twice as resistant a normal car 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.679
 you also have what's left of the celine car to create a team 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.779
 cyclist after their accident at rally britain last year thanks 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.580
 at the speed of more than 160 km by car has killed four 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 it is obviously very heavy fallout but on that sidi moussa to 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.459
 the outside is completely destroyed 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.459
 not 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.139
 action side for the holiday season were almost intact that's 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.849
 not 100% Breton scene 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.680
 even if here at peugeot sport before anything 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.849
 the 206 wrc receives 50 meters of wire in the form of a cage with reinforcements 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.849
 very visible side here the series car 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.809
 that of course 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.899
 the strength of all servers based on begging coralie 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.809
 new violence 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.469
 English and his co-pilot they came out unscathed after the shock the 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.999
 second danger in case of accidents make fire 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.709
 here the strong of my next week but in world a fire remain 

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:29.180
 quite rare here is why 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.729
 yes highways greenways was difficult we took out the tank 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.490
 health are aluminum not its tram preview of safety standards in 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.060
 force that was announced 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.419
 short in fact this tank and deformable especially in the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 perspective of an accident 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.120
 In recent years, WRCs have also made progress in terms of 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.009
 safety but the rally is a particularly dangerous discipline 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:00.569
 most often fortunately only the bodywork suffer from the effects of 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:00.909
 pilots
