00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the threshold we're at so rather than

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.120 
the threshold we're at so rather than
going<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> traditional<00:02:49.050> route<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.650> simply

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
going the traditional route of simply

handing out flyers they wanted to try
something<00:02:52.080> different<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.250> jumped

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
something different and so they jumped

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.120 
something different and so they jumped
