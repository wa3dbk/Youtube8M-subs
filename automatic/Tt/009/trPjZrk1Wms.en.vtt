00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello to all and the body block we get 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.760
 found for a new episode of 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.960
 visits to the public flask and 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.650
 today we are going to visit a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.830
 house that I made live on the 12th 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.810
 July and in a new style 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.420
 in a style a little pyromania 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.990
 mix a little bit with areq y du 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 stop style that lives is also 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.670
 inspired by a real project all that 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.650
 mixed 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.250
 finally a lot inspired by a real project 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.370
 and after there was style at lapiro 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.670
 undeniably 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.450
 finally a little futuristic side 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.079
 futuristic house bone concept web and i 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.370
 I tested myself in this new style 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.810
 I liked by cons I do not control 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.460
 not enough yet 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.600
 at the level of inspiration I miss him 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.810
 still not bad that's why I have 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.580
 used real projects a lot of 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.260
 real projects for now for alizÃ©e 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.780
 this thing but it's not really bad it's 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 like that we learn and I am 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.440
 really happy with the result 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 what it changes and I thought it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.910
 was going to be a little psychorigid 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.680
 finally the fact that they really 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.740
 a lot of diagonal stuff like that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 I thought it was going to be a little 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.580
 rough way into a bit boring but 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.500
 eventually no I find they render 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.500
 it does not hurt this house 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.780
 it's a little boat in the spirit 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.090
 little bit I'm really nice it's 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.009
 that she is all along and there are two 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.740
 three types of breads of different 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.729
 from a 45 degrees it there it looks like the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.670
 from 60 60 to 70 degrees and the slope to 30 degrees to 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.859
 mouth and play with the three pints 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.079
 something long enough paved 1 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.530
 can shake diagonally and with 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.420
 a lot of pilings here that was in 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.170
 the actual project from which I am inspired the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.890
 runway from outside hallway also this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.789
 are three big big inspirations 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.190
 almost breeding but I moan 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.250
 would test but I'll have to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.170
 find other projects also for mixing 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.170
 the ideas need finally brief I 'll see 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.350
 I think it can be nice 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.350
 inevitably stuck on this style will 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.130
 find a mix between what I was doing 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.080
 I regret you will see very little 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.810
 the best thing is to pass 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.720
 directly the so-called visit then speak 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 the main entrance is at the level 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.990
 from the road where there is not really any 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.050
 parking makes it an outdoor parking that 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.239
 I schematize here with the little 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.470
 dotted one can also park at 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.570
 the outside like that passed directly 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.070
 here or so what are we going to do for 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.370
 start taking the gravellard driveway 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.140
 sorry I'm lying street hand as usual 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.880
 the go in gravel is directly 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.709
 we have here actually it's not 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 really a garage but we are protected 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.170
 it's under the house and you can read it 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.070
 larrouture here that's the idea we're going 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.020
 start with the exteriors 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.360
 so in the station the car there we can 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.890
 go here for example are accepted 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.700
 if he sat down classic access 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.110
 pistoles and with here on that side a 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.110
 small relaxation area 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.700
 unique arbor nothing of price take 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.230
 well transcendent with having a little 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.360
 little hustle and bustle here for 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.970
 separate the two squares spaces from 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.890
 parking and pool and we have a 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.500
 little barback isolated here and there 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 ridiculous besides a small barbecue 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.980
 isolated here and we can go around 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.040
 the house pass on this second 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.620
 terrace a little transition the second 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.540
 because the first is this one the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.620
 terrace with little transition I do not know 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.190
 how to call it and we come here from 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.440
 shot at the highway entrance with the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.239
 first terrace where you can have lunch 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.120
 above we saw little on the road is 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:19.489
 not terrible terrible but good then 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.870
 so we can go 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.900
 we can go from everywhere in 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.260
 imagining that we parked his car 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:31.820
 the first access houses here by cons 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.990
 at the pool bill is here at this level 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.400
 there are a lot of levels in this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.440
 house that's nice very good level 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.090
 second level that is passing for 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.840
 therefore access to the 2nd terrace barbecue 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.360
 up the first terrace of this side is 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:53.389
 can say that like that so clearance 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:56.650
 clearance a passage is here we have 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.000
 yet another level with the living room 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.530
 living room so no tv nothing just us 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.750
 we typed arguing not messing around 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.190
 we are in semi mezzanine here compared 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.530
 at that level that's it after I have 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.720
 raises the differences of two levels 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.180
 it's pretty nice this house perrier 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.470
 a little hoof- shaped like that to 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.070
 outside anyway a lot of 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.180
 levels with a big chandelier 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.650
 new styles of mab the cause had 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.820
 already seen but let's say it's a bug there by 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.700
 against yeah it was not like that I 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.960
 repairs and his memories 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.780
 I have full 0.18 2.6 the meaning I have 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.280
 do something like that I do not necessarily 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.010
 friends of the placards everywhere we see these 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.300
 games it's more furniture a little bit more 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.190
 snow film design that I had 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:49.160
 already said in an episode but is 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.420
 that between short living room small wall design of 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.830
 separation we still see through 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:06:00.790
 dining room classic dining room 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.790
 special another storage cabinet 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.699
 cooking and crawling with great 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.740
 table then that can we can use it 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.189
 work plan 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.539
 bach friendly place I like the 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:21.610
 kitchen of this simple home purified 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:26.589
 design the minimum union stairs that 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:30.270
 brings us to the small single room 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:34.719
 corner game agree to our furniture 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.219
 simple rooms also design this and with 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:39.249
 the interior was not my hobby 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.749
 we have access here ben 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:46.839
 I did not do any toilet again 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:48.099
 once it's not bad that he bath 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.469
 always missing something I had 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:53.729
 do not look and we have a so 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:07:01.119
 to third balconies terraces earlier 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:03.189
 I have a gold side dairy products here I know 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:04.809
 not what to say on this balcony there is nothing 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.809
 to say he dreams to say specially and 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:10.809
 after a classic work of you a 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:12.029
 classical classic what was 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.800
 interesting in this house it was 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:15.959
 it was to make my hand with 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.180
 its real project ditches 

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:21.519
 it's this big inspiration almost 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.379
 reproduction to test me on this style 

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:25.419
 a little concept has also futuristic a 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:29.259
 little bit to lapiro a little art and who 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.909
 lives sometimes and well anyway I am 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.110
