at the end of the 19th century Robert
cock<00:00:10.880> defined<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.720> we<00:00:12.780> would<00:00:13.110> recognize<00:00:13.500> if<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
cock defined how we would recognize if a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.600 
cock defined how we would recognize if a
disease<00:00:14.550> was<00:00:14.760> infectious<00:00:15.200> or<00:00:16.200> not<00:00:16.830> whether<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
disease was infectious or not whether it

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.990 
disease was infectious or not whether it
was<00:00:17.700> a<00:00:17.760> communicable<00:00:18.510> disease<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:20.070> so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
was a communicable disease or not so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.749 
was a communicable disease or not so
obviously<00:00:21.599> people<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:22.230> sick<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.310> thing<00:00:23.579> to

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
obviously people get sick the thing to

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.780 
obviously people get sick the thing to
know<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.230> sickness<00:00:25.829> caused<00:00:26.099> by<00:00:26.400> an

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
know is is this sickness caused by an

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.229 
know is is this sickness caused by an
infectious<00:00:28.070> microorganism<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> caused

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
infectious microorganism or is it caused

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.749 
infectious microorganism or is it caused
by<00:00:30.270> something<00:00:30.750> else<00:00:31.489> Robert<00:00:32.489> cough

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
by something else Robert cough

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
by something else Robert cough
brilliantly<00:00:33.450> generated<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.739> he<00:00:34.920> called

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
brilliantly generated what he called

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610 
brilliantly generated what he called
what<00:00:35.610> are<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:35.880> called<00:00:36.149> Koch's<00:00:36.620> postulates

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
what are now called Koch's postulates

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.270 
what are now called Koch's postulates
Robert<00:00:38.460> Koch's<00:00:38.730> postulates<00:00:39.859> so<00:00:40.859> how<00:00:41.039> do<00:00:41.100> we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
Robert Koch's postulates so how do we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.639 
Robert Koch's postulates so how do we
define<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.390> disease<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> infectious

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
define if a disease is infectious

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.419 
define if a disease is infectious
well<00:00:44.460> first<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.480> causative<00:00:46.109> agent

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
well first of all the causative agent

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.310 
well first of all the causative agent
must<00:00:47.429> be<00:00:47.609> found<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.239> every<00:00:48.690> lesion<00:00:49.109> of<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
must be found in every lesion of the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.520 
must be found in every lesion of the
case<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.579> someone's<00:00:51.089> sick<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:52.109> should<00:00:52.140> be

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
case so if someone's sick you should be

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.009 
case so if someone's sick you should be
able<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.800> detect<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.629> somewhere<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.839> their

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
able to detect that somewhere in their

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.950 
able to detect that somewhere in their
body<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.429> is<00:00:56.489> why<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.999> do<00:00:57.179> culture<00:00:57.839> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
body and this is why we do culture and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.099 
body and this is why we do culture and
sensitivity<00:00:58.620> tests<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.690> someone<00:01:00.960> has<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
sensitivity tests so if someone has a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.619 
sensitivity tests so if someone has a
wound<00:01:01.410> infection<00:01:01.620> we'll<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> swab<00:01:03.269> of<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
wound infection we'll take a swab of the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.040 
wound infection we'll take a swab of the
wound<00:01:03.960> AG<00:01:04.350> date<00:01:04.559> send<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
wound AG date send that to the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.480 
wound AG date send that to the
microbiologists<00:01:07.050> they'll<00:01:07.620> culture<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
microbiologists they'll culture it up

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.520 
microbiologists they'll culture it up
and<00:01:08.730> tell<00:01:09.300> us<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.540> antibiotics<00:01:09.840> it's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and tell us what antibiotics it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.460 
and tell us what antibiotics it's
sensitive<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.330> or<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.660> someone<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> chest

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
sensitive to or if someone has a chest

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
sensitive to or if someone has a chest
infection<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.310> they're<00:01:14.880> coughing<00:01:15.270> up

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
infection and they're coughing up

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
infection and they're coughing up
infected<00:01:16.050> sputum<00:01:16.530> again<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> take<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
infected sputum again we can take a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
infected sputum again we can take a
sample<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.660> that<00:01:18.720> sputum<00:01:19.380> send<00:01:20.190> it<00:01:20.340> for

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
sample of that sputum send it for

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.000 
sample of that sputum send it for
culture<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> sensitivity<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.050> if<00:01:22.770> there's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
culture and sensitivity and if there's

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.700 
culture and sensitivity and if there's
an<00:01:23.130> etiological<00:01:24.020> pathogenic<00:01:25.020> microorganisms

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
an etiological pathogenic microorganisms

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.330 
an etiological pathogenic microorganisms
in<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.630> will<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.080> detectable<00:01:28.620> because

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in there that will be detectable because

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.820 
in there that will be detectable because
coughs<00:01:29.850> postulates<00:01:30.600> say<00:01:30.870> that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.620> specific

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
coughs postulates say that the specific

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.390 
coughs postulates say that the specific
causative<00:01:32.790> agent<00:01:33.240> must<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> found<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.830> every

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
causative agent must be found in every

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
causative agent must be found in every
case<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:36.060> disease<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.260> might<00:01:37.530> not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
case of the disease now you might not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
case of the disease now you might not
find<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> straight<00:01:38.280> away<00:01:38.580> but<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.910> will<00:01:39.060> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
find it straight away but it will be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.540 
find it straight away but it will be
there<00:01:39.450> somewhere<00:01:39.870> well<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> other<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.400> do

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
there somewhere well the other one we do

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.190 
there somewhere well the other one we do
in<00:01:41.790> hospital<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.360> someone<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.720> developing

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in hospital if someone is developing

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.310 
in hospital if someone is developing
severe<00:01:43.530> sepsis<00:01:44.180> is<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.600> blood<00:01:45.870> cultures

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
severe sepsis is will do blood cultures

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.890 
severe sepsis is will do blood cultures
so<00:01:47.160> we'll<00:01:47.370> take<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.730> blood<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.750> if

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
so we'll take the blood and see if

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.350 
so we'll take the blood and see if
there's<00:01:49.050> bacteria<00:01:49.290> growing<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.120> blood

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
there's bacteria growing in the blood

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
there's bacteria growing in the blood
and<00:01:51.690> these<00:01:52.440> days<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.010> also<00:01:53.160> do<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> same

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and these days we can also do the same

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.970 
and these days we can also do the same
with<00:01:53.880> viruses<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.870> harder<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.320> viruses<00:01:55.800> to

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
with viruses it's harder with viruses to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.250 
with viruses it's harder with viruses to
culture<00:01:56.310> viruses<00:01:56.760> Brittany<00:01:57.060> camera<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
culture viruses Brittany camera so the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.010 
culture viruses Brittany camera so the
first<00:01:58.470> postulate<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.310> if<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.420> disease<00:02:00.750> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
first postulate is if this disease is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.960 
first postulate is if this disease is
genuinely<00:02:01.620> caused<00:02:01.980> by<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.430> infectious

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
genuinely caused by this infectious

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.320 
genuinely caused by this infectious
organism<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.530> an<00:02:04.620> infectious

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
organism if it is actually an infectious

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.180 
organism if it is actually an infectious
communicable<00:02:06.330> disease<00:02:06.720> then<00:02:07.560> first<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.039> all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
communicable disease then first of all

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.430 
communicable disease then first of all
we<00:02:08.250> should<00:02:08.399> better<00:02:08.819> identify<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.720> bacteria

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
we should better identify the bacteria

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.870 
we should better identify the bacteria
in<00:02:10.979> lesions<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.790> case<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:14.280> next<00:02:14.580> thing<00:02:14.730> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
in lesions of the case the next thing is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.390 
in lesions of the case the next thing is
having<00:02:15.150> got<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.720> bacteria<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.950> should<00:02:17.250> be

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
having got this bacteria it should be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220 
having got this bacteria it should be

grow them up they'll grow many millions
or<00:02:28.470> billions<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> bacteria<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
or billions of the bacteria so it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.680 
or billions of the bacteria so it
becomes<00:02:30.690> very<00:02:30.930> easy<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.800> identify<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.690> and

becomes very easy to identify it and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.590 
becomes very easy to identify it and
then<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> healthy<00:02:35.550> subject<00:02:35.940> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
then if you take a healthy subject and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.470 
then if you take a healthy subject and
give<00:02:37.140> then<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.650> bacteria<00:02:37.830> or<00:02:38.730> give<00:02:39.030> them<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
virus that healthy subjects will then

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.110 
virus that healthy subjects will then
develop<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.080> disease<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.550> thankfully<00:02:44.880> we

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
develop the disease now thankfully we

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
develop the disease now thankfully we
don't<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.690> everytime<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.319> clinical

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
don't do this everytime in clinical

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't do this everytime in clinical
practice<00:02:46.709> but<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.620> science

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
practice but this is this is the science

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.190 
practice but this is this is the science
behind<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:50.970> grow<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.540> bacteria

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
behind it so you grow up the bacteria

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.770 
behind it so you grow up the bacteria
you<00:02:52.500> give<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.580> bacteria<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> healthy

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you give the bacteria to a healthy

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.110 
you give the bacteria to a healthy
subject<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:56.130> healthy<00:02:56.489> subject<00:02:56.970> will

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
subject and that healthy subject will

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.960 
subject and that healthy subject will
get<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.450> same<00:02:57.750> disease<00:02:58.680> as<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.730> first

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
get the same disease as the first

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.090 
get the same disease as the first
patient<00:03:00.450> had<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.319> communicable<00:03:01.980> it

patient had because it's communicable it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.190 
patient had because it's communicable it
shows<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.110> be

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
shows that and then if you want to be

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.280 
shows that and then if you want to be
pedantic<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:05.010> fourth<00:03:05.250> criteria<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.930> again

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
pedantic the fourth criteria is is again

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.289 
pedantic the fourth criteria is is again
that<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.920> should<00:03:08.130> be<00:03:08.190> able<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.489> recover<00:03:08.910> the

organism from the person that you've
deliberately<00:03:12.150> infected<00:03:13.549> so<00:03:14.549> let's<00:03:14.700> take<00:03:14.880> an

deliberately infected so let's take an

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.949 
deliberately infected so let's take an
example<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> 1990s<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.450> young<00:03:18.630> Australian

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
example in the 1990s a young Australian

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.050 
example in the 1990s a young Australian
doctor<00:03:19.500> called<00:03:19.709> Barry<00:03:19.950> Marshall<00:03:20.310> said<00:03:20.819> that

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
doctor called Barry Marshall said that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.840 
doctor called Barry Marshall said that
stomach<00:03:21.510> ulcers<00:03:22.340> judean<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.519> also

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
stomach ulcers judean and also

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.030 
stomach ulcers judean and also
spectacles<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.720> anyway<00:03:25.019> said<00:03:25.290> peptic<00:03:25.680> ulcers

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
spectacles as anyway said peptic ulcers

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.220 
spectacles as anyway said peptic ulcers
were<00:03:26.670> caused<00:03:26.880> by<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> bacteria<00:03:27.959> called

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
were caused by a bacteria called

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.979 
were caused by a bacteria called
Helicobacter<00:03:28.489> pylori<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.820> at<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.540> time<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
Helicobacter pylori and at the time this

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.050 
Helicobacter pylori and at the time this
seemed<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.739> new<00:03:31.859> Dukas<00:03:32.190> idea<00:03:32.579> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
seemed to be as the new Dukas idea the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.330 
seemed to be as the new Dukas idea the
idea<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.600> peptic<00:03:34.019> ulcers<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.530> caused<00:03:34.739> by<00:03:35.010> an

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
idea that peptic ulcers was caused by an

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.780 
idea that peptic ulcers was caused by an
impact<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:36.120> bacteria<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.549> what<00:03:38.549> Barry

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
impact of bacteria so what Barry

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
impact of bacteria so what Barry
Marshall<00:03:39.060> did<00:03:39.420> was<00:03:39.660> he<00:03:39.959> got<00:03:40.170> some

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
Marshall did was he got some

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.750 
Marshall did was he got some
Helicobacter<00:03:41.370> he<00:03:42.180> cultured<00:03:42.720> them<00:03:43.220> he<00:03:44.220> got<00:03:44.430> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
Helicobacter he cultured them he got a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.000 
Helicobacter he cultured them he got a
nice<00:03:45.329> big<00:03:45.600> vial<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.109> these<00:03:46.290> Helicobacter

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
nice big vial of these Helicobacter

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.250 
nice big vial of these Helicobacter
pylori<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.820> then<00:03:48.570> he<00:03:48.660> took<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> healthy

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
pylori and then he took a healthy

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.670 
pylori and then he took a healthy
subject<00:03:49.440> he<00:03:50.310> took<00:03:50.489> himself<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.989> he<00:03:52.140> drank<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
subject he took himself and he drank a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.199 
subject he took himself and he drank a
heavy<00:03:52.890> draft<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.489> they<00:03:53.609> can't<00:03:53.790> go<00:03:53.940> back<00:03:54.090> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
heavy draft if they can't go back to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.780 
heavy draft if they can't go back to
pylori<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.959> as<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.799> result<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.340> getting<00:03:56.459> that

pylori and as a result of getting that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.710 
pylori and as a result of getting that
he<00:03:56.940> got<00:03:57.120> severe<00:03:57.540> gastric<00:03:58.230> inflammation<00:03:59.130> and

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
he got severe gastric inflammation and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.050 
he got severe gastric inflammation and
ulceration<00:04:01.160> demonstrating<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.819> was<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
ulceration demonstrating that it was the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.830 
ulceration demonstrating that it was the
Helicobacter<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.230> caused<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.840> gastric

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.990 
ulcers and during losses and gastritis
in<00:04:09.900> his<00:04:10.049> case<00:04:10.290> then<00:04:11.069> fortunately<00:04:11.549> he<00:04:11.730> was<00:04:11.850> able

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
in his case then fortunately he was able

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.289 
in his case then fortunately he was able
to<00:04:12.180> treat<00:04:12.450> himself<00:04:12.630> by<00:04:13.049> eradicating<00:04:13.319> the

to treat himself by eradicating the

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.060 
to treat himself by eradicating the
Helicobacter<00:04:15.299> that's<00:04:15.959> why<00:04:16.169> now<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.650> someone's

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
Helicobacter that's why now if someone's

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
Helicobacter that's why now if someone's
complaining<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.729> peptic<00:04:18.120> ulcers<00:04:18.510> we<00:04:18.690> give

complaining of peptic ulcers we give

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.400 
complaining of peptic ulcers we give
them<00:04:19.820> Helicobacter<00:04:20.820> pylori<00:04:21.239> eradication

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.830 
therapy to get rid of the bacteria and
that<00:04:24.810> cures<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.350> vast<00:04:25.560> majority<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:26.370> patients

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
that cures the vast majority of patients

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.510 
that cures the vast majority of patients
so<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:28.320> what<00:04:28.530> Barry<00:04:28.740> Marshall<00:04:29.039> did<00:04:29.370> was

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
so really what Barry Marshall did was

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.999 
so really what Barry Marshall did was
used

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009

Pop's postulates to prove that it was
actually<00:04:33.159> infectious<00:04:33.789> condition<00:04:34.240> so

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
actually infectious condition so

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.140 
actually infectious condition so
