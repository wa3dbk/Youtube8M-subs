difference<00:03:11.900> between<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.410> colibri<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.310> super

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
difference between the colibri and super

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.839 
difference between the colibri and super
colibri<00:03:14.329> compared<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.560> regular<00:03:15.680> 22<00:03:16.579> caliber

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
colibri compared to a regular 22 caliber

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.720 
colibri compared to a regular 22 caliber
long<00:03:17.359> rifle<00:03:17.870> as<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.829> can<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.549> bullet

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
long rifle as you can see the bullet

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.870 
long rifle as you can see the bullet
itself<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.510> significantly<00:03:21.319> smaller<00:03:21.880> clearing

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
itself is significantly smaller clearing

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.300 
itself is significantly smaller clearing
again<00:03:23.180> uses<00:03:23.599> a<00:03:23.630> 20<00:03:24.019> grain<00:03:24.230> whereas<00:03:25.069> your

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
again uses a 20 grain whereas your

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.110 
again uses a 20 grain whereas your
normal<00:03:25.669> 22<00:03:26.209> long<00:03:26.480> rifle<00:03:26.510> uses<00:03:27.349> a<00:03:27.500> 40<00:03:27.919> grain<00:03:28.190> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
normal 22 long rifle uses a 40 grain the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.390 
normal 22 long rifle uses a 40 grain the
shell<00:03:29.959> itself<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.579> bullet<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.750> is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
shell itself that the bullet is in is

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:50.110 
shell itself that the bullet is in is
the<00:03:34.400> same<00:03:34.609> size

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.120 

so<00:03:51.120> what<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.300> did<00:03:51.420> was<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:52.200> went<00:03:52.230> ahead<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.710> shot

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
so what I did was I went ahead and shot

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.740 
so what I did was I went ahead and shot
it<00:03:53.250> toward<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:53.730> edge<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.390> could<00:03:54.570> get<00:03:54.720> a

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
it toward this edge so I could get a

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.700 
it toward this edge so I could get a
better<00:03:55.020> shot<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:57.260> slow-motion<00:03:58.260> camera

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
better shot with the slow-motion camera

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.130 
better shot with the slow-motion camera
so<00:03:59.520> I<00:03:59.550> wanted<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.910> bring<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.270> toward<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.840> edge

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
so I wanted to bring it toward this edge

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.140 
so I wanted to bring it toward this edge
and<00:04:01.190> bring<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.370> high<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.580> leave<00:04:02.850> space<00:04:03.120> for

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
and bring it up high to leave space for

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.270 
and bring it up high to leave space for
some<00:04:03.630> other<00:04:03.810> shot<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.710> was<00:04:04.860> intentional

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
some other shot so that was intentional

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.810 
some other shot so that was intentional
shoot<00:04:05.940> up<00:04:06.060> here<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:07.590> let's<00:04:07.650> take<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.250> look<00:04:08.520> at

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
shoot up here and let's take a look at

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.930 
shoot up here and let's take a look at
the<00:04:09.510> side<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.880> see<00:04:11.880> how<00:04:12.210> many<00:04:13.100> pieces<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.580> went

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the side and see how many pieces it went

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.870 
the side and see how many pieces it went
through<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:17.010> what<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:18.900> want<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.170> do<00:04:19.820> show<00:04:20.820> you

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
through and what I want to do show you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.340 
through and what I want to do show you
the<00:04:21.090> back<00:04:21.300> here<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> went<00:04:22.140> through<00:04:22.290> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
the back here so I went through the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.710 
the back here so I went through the
first<00:04:22.650> really<00:04:23.550> blew<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:24.150> pretty<00:04:24.450> good

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
first really blew it out pretty good

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.540 
first really blew it out pretty good
there<00:04:25.050> went<00:04:25.440> through<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> second<00:04:26.100> one<00:04:26.250> went

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
there went through the second one went

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.510 
there went through the second one went
through<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.790> third<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.390> stopped<00:04:28.140> at<00:04:28.520> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
through the third one and stopped at the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.130 
through the third one and stopped at the
fort<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.600> round<00:04:31.880> even<00:04:32.880> though<00:04:33.000> it's<00:04:33.300> low

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
fort so this round even though it's low

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
fort so this round even though it's low
power<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.570> you<00:04:36.570> know<00:04:36.690> only<00:04:36.840> traveling<00:04:37.350> at<00:04:37.500> 500

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
power and you know only traveling at 500

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.790 
power and you know only traveling at 500
feet<00:04:38.760> per<00:04:39.030> second<00:04:39.540> still<00:04:40.080> managed<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.500> get

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
feet per second still managed to get

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.970 
feet per second still managed to get
through<00:04:42.710> one<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.490> half<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.110> let's<00:04:46.800> go<00:04:46.950> ahead

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
through one and a half so let's go ahead

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.960 
through one and a half so let's go ahead
and<00:04:47.280> take<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.550> look<00:04:47.640> here<00:04:48.120> oh<00:04:48.300> yeah<00:04:49.170> there<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.500> is

and take a look here oh yeah there it is

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.020 
and take a look here oh yeah there it is
see<00:04:50.970> if<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.180> could<00:04:51.240> get<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.630> out<00:04:55.730> let<00:04:56.730> me<00:04:56.760> show

there it is went through one and a half

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.850 
there it is went through one and a half
almost<00:05:28.240> through<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.590> complete<00:05:30.190> walls<00:05:31.860> I'm

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
almost through to complete walls I'm

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.010 
almost through to complete walls I'm

considering two pieces of plaster here a

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.480 
considering two pieces of plaster here a
wall<00:05:38.020> because<00:05:38.470> usually<00:05:38.650> have<00:05:38.980> a<00:05:39.040> front<00:05:39.340> in<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.250 
wall because usually have a front in the
back<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:40.360> would<00:05:40.840> have<00:05:40.960> made<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.230> through

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
back so it would have made it through

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.920 
back so it would have made it through
one<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:41.920> almost<00:05:42.820> threw<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.420> second<00:05:43.870> one<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:46.840> you

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
one and almost threw a second one so you

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.380 
one and almost threw a second one so you
still<00:05:47.140> have<00:05:47.290> to<00:05:47.410> be<00:05:47.500> careful<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.390> agila

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
still have to be careful with the agila

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.920
