00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
sensor and another one right here right

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.970 
sensor and another one right here right
to<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:38.200> where<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.350> radiator<00:02:39.769> fluid

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
to the right of where the radiator fluid

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
to the right of where the radiator fluid
enters<00:02:40.849> into<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.299> radiator<00:02:42.110> there<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.040> a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
enters into the radiator there is a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.300 
enters into the radiator there is a
number<00:02:44.810> 10<00:02:44.989> millimeter<00:02:45.380> bolt<00:02:45.709> on<00:02:45.980> both<00:02:46.130> these
