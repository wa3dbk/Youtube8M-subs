sometimes the drops under the skin start
in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> outer<00:01:27.240> corner<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.229> near<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
in the outer corner and just near the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.410 
in the outer corner and just near the
lash<00:01:29.340> line<00:01:29.780> slightly<00:01:31.729> start<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> add<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.390> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
lash line slightly start to add and just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.929 
lash line slightly start to add and just
move<00:01:34.020> along<00:01:34.170> slowly<00:01:34.650> pushing<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> color<00:01:35.520> into

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
move along slowly pushing the color into

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.810 
move along slowly pushing the color into
the<00:01:36.060> socket<00:01:36.450> almost<00:01:37.439> creating<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> round

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the socket almost creating a round

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.600 
the socket almost creating a round
motion<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> brush<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
motion with a brush because you can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580 
motion with a brush because you can
really<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> push<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> blends<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
really kind of push and it blends at the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
really kind of push and it blends at the
same<00:01:43.799> time<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:44.670> start<00:01:44.820> working<00:01:45.390> up

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
same time and then start working up

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.929 
same time and then start working up
through<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> socket<00:01:46.710> line<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> go

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
through the socket line you want to go

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.980 
through the socket line you want to go
from<00:01:48.210> dark<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.810> light<00:01:49.159> so<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.790> ends<00:01:51.329> dense

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
from dark to light so this ends dense

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
from dark to light so this ends dense
and<00:01:52.259> dark<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> socket<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> lash<00:01:53.670> line

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and dark in the socket and the lash line

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.590 
and dark in the socket and the lash line
and<00:01:54.180> then

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and then

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
and then
to<00:01:54.780> blend<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> keep<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> light<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to blend it out and keep it light up on

underneath the lash line at the bottom
this<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.239> create<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.600> more<00:03:15.840> dramatic<00:03:15.989> effect

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000

this end and it filters out in the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.680 
this end and it filters out in the
middle<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.609> you're<00:03:23.790> leaving<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.540> bit
