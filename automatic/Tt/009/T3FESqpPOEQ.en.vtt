are then renting them out is that still

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
are then renting them out is that still
good<00:00:45.750> news<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:47.250> argue<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
good news I think I would argue that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
good news I think I would argue that
that's<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.270> most<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> would<00:00:49.230> argue<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
that's not most of it I would argue that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
that's not most of it I would argue that
most<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> legitimate<00:00:51.270> real

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
most of it really is legitimate real

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
most of it really is legitimate real
natural<00:00:51.780> organic<00:00:52.530> growth<00:00:52.800> buyers<00:00:53.460> for

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
natural organic growth buyers for

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.020 
natural organic growth buyers for
housing<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.399> housing<00:00:56.910> will

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
housing and so I think housing will

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.430 
housing and so I think housing will
continue<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.539> strong<00:00:57.690> i<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.079> consumer

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
continue to be strong i think consumer

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
continue to be strong i think consumer
spending<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> continue<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.699> okay

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
spending is going to continue to be okay

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.740 
spending is going to continue to be okay
the<00:01:00.930> energy<00:01:01.320> industry<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> doing<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.750> autos

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the energy industry is doing well autos

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
the energy industry is doing well autos
are<00:01:03.989> doing<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.680> aircraft<00:01:05.489> spending<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970

are doing very well aircraft spending is
doing<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.270> well<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.200> lots<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
doing very well so there are lots of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
doing very well so there are lots of
things<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:07.979> working<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.790> economy

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
things that are working in this economy

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
things that are working in this economy
like<00:01:09.780> earnings<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.229> keeping<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.830> think

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
like earnings are keeping up I think

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.300 
like earnings are keeping up I think
earnings<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:12.530> challenged<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> quarter<00:01:14.130> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
earnings are challenged this quarter but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
earnings are challenged this quarter but
we<00:01:14.430> did<00:01:14.700> raise<00:01:14.939> taxes<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.409> cutting

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
we did raise taxes we are cutting

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.050 
we did raise taxes we are cutting
spending<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> talked<00:01:17.670> about<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
spending as you talked about in the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
spending as you talked about in the
previous<00:01:18.330> segment<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.170> lot<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.040> people<00:01:20.250> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
previous segment a lot of people just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.060 
previous segment a lot of people just
railed<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> big<00:01:21.030> capital<00:01:21.479> gains<00:01:21.630> tax<00:01:21.990> check<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
railed a big capital gains tax check to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
railed a big capital gains tax check to
the<00:01:23.100> government<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.909> within<00:01:24.210> recent<00:01:24.479> weeks

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the government right within recent weeks

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
the government right within recent weeks
so<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.799> some<00:01:26.220> headwind<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.509> fiscal

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so there is some headwind on the fiscal

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710 
so there is some headwind on the fiscal
side<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.820> said<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.150> done<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
side but when all is said and done I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
side but when all is said and done I
think<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> economy<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.890> continue<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
think the economy will continue to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
think the economy will continue to
muddle<00:01:32.549> through<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.079> further

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
muddle through and as we get further

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630 
muddle through and as we get further
into<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> year<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.130> confidence<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
into the year I think confidence is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
into the year I think confidence is
going<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> return<00:01:36.030> okay<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.689> muddling

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going to return okay if we're muddling

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
going to return okay if we're muddling
through<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> 1740<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
through how do we get to 1740 in the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
those legitimate good long-term and what

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.259 
those legitimate good long-term and what
I'm<00:03:21.680> also<00:03:21.859> hearing<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.370> say<00:03:22.549> if<00:03:22.730> you've<00:03:23.060> got

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
I'm also hearing you say if you've got

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.030 
I'm also hearing you say if you've got
to<00:03:23.389> go<00:03:23.450> stock<00:03:23.750> by<00:03:23.959> stuck<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.500> can't<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.859> pick

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
to go stock by stuck you can't just pick

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.470 
to go stock by stuck you can't just pick
a<00:03:25.069> sector<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.609> got<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.880> really<00:03:26.120> drill<00:03:26.450> down

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
a sector you got to really drill down

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
a sector you got to really drill down
and<00:03:26.630> know<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.109> company<00:03:27.440> yeah<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.650> think<00:03:27.859> that's

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and know the company yeah I think that's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.000 
and know the company yeah I think that's
particularly<00:03:28.849> true<00:03:29.319> today<00:03:30.319> more<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:30.829> than

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
particularly true today more so than

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.530 
particularly true today more so than
usual<00:03:31.340> because<00:03:31.819> there's<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.239> quite<00:03:32.510> a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
usual because there's a quite a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.720 
usual because there's a quite a
diversion<00:03:33.139> within<00:03:33.470> each<00:03:33.620> sector<00:03:34.069> as<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.639> how

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
diversion within each sector as to how

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.380 
diversion within each sector as to how
some<00:03:35.000> companies<00:03:35.359> are<00:03:35.510> doing<00:03:35.540> versus<00:03:36.049> others
