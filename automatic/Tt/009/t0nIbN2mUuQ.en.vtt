00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:07.220
 here we are again 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:10.269
 a round appendix 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.530
 as I had said 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 had a defective part 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.200
 and secondly they said that if you stay 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 taking a little parari will stop at the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.300
 its that in its fifth that there if not 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 think of effect like I did the previous video 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.910
 Then you saw that I took a thread 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 You cry butterfly here's the sensor. 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.400
 of the defective butterfly 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.400
 this is the original magneti marelli 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.190
 this is what was malfunctioning there 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.920
 I may have already 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 resistance that has damaged the unit 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.560
 was installed the new part 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560
 here is her box 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.690
 now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.390
 I installed the new part 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.010
 lost the movies 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.010
 and it's not a bad play either 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.890
 is the old part 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:32.810
 damaged 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:34.100
 and now there's the round car 100 paid 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.630
 without oscillation 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.630
 without excessive fuel consumption 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.620
 that's it folks flying here one more 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.500
 depending on the part you can 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.330
 identify thus by drawing wire 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.020
 This is the butterfly sensor. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.760
 there any because the piece you can 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.890
 take in the movie you can be 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.390
 identifying 5 as I said has a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.620
 no one has identified the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.940
 problem of my father 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.940
 and it 's that piece that right 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 was verified the existence sensor map 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.990
 map and is not defective 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.070
 so I went in this play here with you 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.970
 They are seen in another video that's it right 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.970
 thanks guys
