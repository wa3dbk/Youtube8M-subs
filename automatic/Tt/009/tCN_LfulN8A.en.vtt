00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.600
 Sometimes I come from her home 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.450
 understand what destiny all 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.290
 powerful reserves us with the Bible 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.820
 talking about death and writing to be 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.550
 honest it was not at all what 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:32.259
 I was expecting nobody to move 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:37.149
 will not go anywhere then competing in common 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.649
 I took things in hand I'm doing 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.780
 so that these people stay united is in 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.950
 life that's what you want to do what 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.940
 that it happens from the beginning was 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 never asked to be a chef 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.570
 I even kill my best friend for 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.570
 protect you 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 what I want is to leave from here 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.350
 the furthest if like you and take 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.580
 a new start 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580
 - from here 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 to start somewhere but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.830
 maybe I'm worried maybe 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.830
 it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 I'm not wearing my face 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.310
 to tell 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.940
 people according to this party 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 but let things be clear 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.469
 if you stay 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.590
 task democracy case has just 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.590
 die
