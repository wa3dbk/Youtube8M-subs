00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
know it's me to four times around but

when<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.570> comes<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.900> work<00:00:10.110> there<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.440> nobody

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
when it comes to work there is nobody

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.209 
when it comes to work there is nobody
who<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.730> exactly<00:00:12.179> between<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:13.230> half<00:00:13.530> care<00:00:13.860> at

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
who is exactly between one half care at

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420 
who is exactly between one half care at
a<00:00:14.250> time<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> simply<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.560> enough<00:00:16.949> for

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
a time and it is simply not enough for

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
a time and it is simply not enough for
the<00:00:17.490> worst<00:00:17.699> -<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.510> figure<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.350> proper

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the worst - to figure out the proper

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.130 
the worst - to figure out the proper
coordination<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.850> why<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.840> walks

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
coordination there so why not in walks

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.400 
coordination there so why not in walks
quitting<00:00:22.859> sometimes<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:25.050> bigger

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
quitting sometimes it's be for bigger

quitting sometimes it's be for bigger
food<00:00:26.070> carrots<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> horse<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.390> enough

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
food carrots that the horse has enough

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.859 
food carrots that the horse has enough
time<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.710> figure<00:00:28.949> out<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> proper<00:00:29.869> basis

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
time to figure out the proper basis

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.830 
time to figure out the proper basis
thanks<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.769> that's<00:00:32.640> sometimes<00:00:33.149> simply<00:00:33.660> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
thanks and that's sometimes simply all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.979 
thanks and that's sometimes simply all
it<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.550> participating<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> few<00:00:36.780> times

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it is participating can do a few times

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.560 
it is participating can do a few times
way<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> keep<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> center<00:00:38.700> over<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
way to keep the center over here and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
way to keep the center over here and
then<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.489> bit<00:00:41.879> bigger

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
then let's make that a little bit bigger

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
then let's make that a little bit bigger
and<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.680> few<00:00:43.829> times<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.610> instead

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and let's do it a few times now instead

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
and let's do it a few times now instead
of<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.090> doing<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.660> half<00:00:45.840> parrot

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of just doing a half parrot

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
of just doing a half parrot
we<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.190> keep<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.460> around<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.969> few<00:00:48.120> times

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we just keep going around a few times

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
we just keep going around a few times
and<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.840> he<00:00:48.989> needs<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> wake<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:50.460> were<00:00:50.579> no

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and if he needs to wake up there were no

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.810 
and if he needs to wake up there were no
need<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> too<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.750> yeah<00:00:52.110> that's<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.309> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
need to be too so yeah that's it but

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.350 
need to be too so yeah that's it but
it's<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.270> important<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.809> our<00:00:55.170> horses<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.360> -

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's so important for our horses to -

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
it's so important for our horses to -
that<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.410> simply<00:00:58.800> enough<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that they have simply enough time to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
that they have simply enough time to
figure<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.940> exactly<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> do

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
figure out exactly what we need to do

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.600 
figure out exactly what we need to do
comes<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.129> :<00:01:02.520> again<00:01:02.840> yeah<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.339> been

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
comes there : again yeah so that it been

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.789 
comes there : again yeah so that it been
the<00:01:05.760> school<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.290> tell<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the school is that we can you tell the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
the school is that we can you tell the
person<00:01:07.950> team<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> Hank<00:01:09.210> next

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
person team this is where you Hank next

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810 
person team this is where you Hank next
need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.290> stay<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> activity

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
need to be to stay this is the activity

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.230 
need to be to stay this is the activity
you<00:01:12.330> need<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> keep<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.460> then<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.880> home<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you need to keep and then this home that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
you need to keep and then this home that
he<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.450> six<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.590> yeah<00:01:17.460> but

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
he has six in a little bit more yeah but

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.710 
he has six in a little bit more yeah but
if<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:19.970> hundred<00:01:20.970> eighty<00:01:21.270> degrees

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
if we just do hundred eighty degrees

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
if we just do hundred eighty degrees
it's<00:01:22.020> um<00:01:22.170> sometimes<00:01:22.710> simply<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.220> enough<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it's um sometimes simply not enough so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's um sometimes simply not enough so
here<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.990> he<00:01:25.350> gets<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:25.920> low<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
here we see he gets a little bit low in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.580 
here we see he gets a little bit low in
coordination<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.150> course<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> pair<00:01:28.290> head<00:01:28.470> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
coordination of course the pair head is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.890 
coordination of course the pair head is
a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:29.009> bigger<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.630> even

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
a little bit bigger that we can even

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
a little bit bigger that we can even
make<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> sometimes<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:32.520> circle<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
make it sometimes a circle like this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.899 
make it sometimes a circle like this
five<00:01:33.900> metres<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.530> diameter<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.640> then

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
five metres in diameter and then

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.880 
five metres in diameter and then
bringing<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> large<00:01:36.840> live<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
bringing the large live in it and a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
bringing the large live in it and a
little<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.490> firmer<00:01:38.820> correction<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.509> your

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
little bit firmer correction in your

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.469 
little bit firmer correction in your
extensions<00:01:40.409> perfect

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
extensions perfect

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.219 
extensions perfect
so<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> horse

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.200 

put<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.439> forward<00:01:49.680> again<00:01:49.830> it's<00:01:50.430> been<00:01:50.580> stuck<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
put it forward again it's been stuck in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.590 
put it forward again it's been stuck in
this<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> safety<00:01:52.020> net<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.909> candidly<00:01:54.360> would

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
this to the safety net it candidly would

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
this to the safety net it candidly would
not<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.200> moment<00:01:55.920> over<00:01:56.220> again<00:01:56.490> hospital

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
not just do moment over again hospital

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
not just do moment over again hospital
right<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.450> horses<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.650> they<00:01:59.430> need<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
right now horses would they need to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
right now horses would they need to
learn<00:01:59.990> spiralling<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.470> introduced<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
learn spiralling that we introduced the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
learn spiralling that we introduced the
theorists<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.600> exact

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
theorists and that's the same exact

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
theorists and that's the same exact
thing<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.649> walk<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> keep<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
thing in walk that's it and keep it a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.110 
thing in walk that's it and keep it a
little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.690> different<00:02:10.110> isn't<00:02:10.550> that's<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
little bit different isn't that's it and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.600 
little bit different isn't that's it and
then<00:02:12.450> keep<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.200> bunch<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.950> it'll<00:02:14.100> make<00:02:14.370> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
then keep the bunch of it it'll make it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.040 
then keep the bunch of it it'll make it
a<00:02:14.640> little<00:02:14.760> bit<00:02:14.970> an<00:02:15.060> argument<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.660> simply

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
a little bit an argument you simply

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.800 
a little bit an argument you simply
think<00:02:16.260> about<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:17.190> I've<00:02:17.400> ever<00:02:17.700> served<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.480> a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
think about if I've ever served or is a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.870 
think about if I've ever served or is a
little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.230> try<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> idea<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.700> he

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
little bit if you try the idea if he

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.229 
little bit if you try the idea if he
needs<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:22.040> infeasible<00:02:23.040> folder<00:02:23.670> moment<00:02:24.060> get

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
needs to be infeasible folder moment get

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.940 
needs to be infeasible folder moment get
out<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:24.930> perfectly<00:02:25.410> fine<00:02:25.650> too

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
out of it that's perfectly fine too

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.729 
out of it that's perfectly fine too
yep<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.940> sometimes<00:02:27.620> anticipates<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
yep you can see sometimes anticipates a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.550 
yep you can see sometimes anticipates a
little<00:02:29.160> regains<00:02:29.519> economic<00:02:30.180> here<00:02:30.540> motor<00:02:31.319> fun

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
little regains economic here motor fun

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.949 
little regains economic here motor fun
that's<00:02:31.830> where<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.220> make<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.610> bigger<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:33.750> we

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
that's where we make it bigger here we

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.540 
that's where we make it bigger here we
should<00:02:34.019> also<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> option<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.310> writing

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
should also have the option of writing

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.110 
should also have the option of writing
couple<00:02:36.450> steps<00:02:36.630> shoulder<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.350> between<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.790> of

feel that she takes over let's bring
that<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.549> his<00:02:44.670> attention<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:46.170> let's<00:02:46.830> go<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
that to his attention and now let's go a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.900 
that to his attention and now let's go a
little<00:02:47.069> bit<00:02:47.370> shoulder<00:02:47.790> over<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.299> into<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
little bit shoulder over like into the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.670 
little bit shoulder over like into the
terminal<00:02:50.910> conscious<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.600> let's<00:02:51.989> make<00:02:52.620> sure

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
terminal conscious and let's make sure

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.880 
terminal conscious and let's make sure
that<00:02:52.860> our<00:02:53.220> inner<00:02:53.670> leg<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.590> effective

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
that our inner leg is just as effective

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.830 
that our inner leg is just as effective
as<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.579> outside<00:02:56.970> packet<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.600> not

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
as the outside packet this is not

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.789 
as the outside packet this is not
different<00:02:58.350> later<00:02:58.920> under<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.310> candle<00:03:03.650> if<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
different later under the candle if you

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.039 
different later under the candle if you
want<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> connect<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.600> immediately<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:06.959> now

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
want to connect this immediately but now

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.949 
want to connect this immediately but now
versus<00:03:07.470> anticipate<00:03:08.329> let's<00:03:09.329> make<00:03:09.600> sure<00:03:09.630> we

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
versus anticipate let's make sure we

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.800 
versus anticipate let's make sure we
stick<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.350> our<00:03:10.410> rules<00:03:10.739> at<00:03:11.100> each<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:50.330 

-<00:03:47.780> okay<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.799> couple<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.189> minutes

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
- okay just for a couple of minutes

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.030 
- okay just for a couple of minutes
that's<00:03:50.669> going<00:03:50.939> into<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.359> show<00:03:51.599> name<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.290> I

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that's going into the show name and I

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.619 
that's going into the show name and I
think<00:03:53.669> what<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.620> morning<00:03:55.859> was<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
think what this morning was the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:04.869 
think what this morning was the
difference<00:03:57.629> between<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:59.810> engagement<00:04:01.760> video

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.429 

yeah<00:04:05.879> let's<00:04:06.120> go<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.480> right<00:04:06.629> we<00:04:07.409> have

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
yeah let's go to the right we have

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.580 
yeah let's go to the right we have
actually<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.519> had<00:04:08.669> some<00:04:08.699> engagement<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:10.079> him

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
actually we had some engagement but him

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.179 
actually we had some engagement but him
there

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
there

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.759 
there
we<00:04:11.459> simply<00:04:12.090> lost<00:04:12.449> a<00:04:12.629> little<00:04:12.750> bit<00:04:12.930> activity<00:04:13.409> yes

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
we simply lost a little bit activity yes

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.129 
we simply lost a little bit activity yes
and<00:04:14.459> we<00:04:14.909> can<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.389> once<00:04:15.599> in<00:04:15.719> a<00:04:15.750> while<00:04:15.930> he

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
and we can see you once in a while he

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.279 
and we can see you once in a while he
needs<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.440> wake<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.949> little<00:04:17.130> bit<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.289> the

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
needs to wake up a little bit so the

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.289 
needs to wake up a little bit so the
solution<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.039> actually<00:04:20.220> fairly<00:04:20.639> simple<00:04:21.030> at

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
solution is actually fairly simple at

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.499 
solution is actually fairly simple at
that<00:04:21.479> time<00:04:21.720> we<00:04:22.259> simply<00:04:22.740> write<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.970> just<00:04:24.360> a

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
that time we simply write in just a

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.439 
that time we simply write in just a
touch<00:04:24.750> more<00:04:24.810> folder<00:04:25.620> throughout<00:04:26.009> them<00:04:26.449> when

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
touch more folder throughout them when

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.810 
touch more folder throughout them when
we<00:04:27.690> when<00:04:28.199> we<00:04:28.229> stop<00:04:28.560> showing<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.159> in<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.340> lot<00:04:29.639> of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
we when we stop showing it in the lot of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.760 
we when we stop showing it in the lot of
horses<00:04:30.120> feel<00:04:30.509> that<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.990> lot<00:04:31.169> harder<00:04:31.440> to

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
horses feel that it's a lot harder to

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.999 
horses feel that it's a lot harder to
engage<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.400> ninth<00:04:32.669> egg<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.900> will<00:04:34.110> now<00:04:34.320> go

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
engage the ninth egg so this will now go

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.550 
engage the ninth egg so this will now go
and<00:04:35.580> be<00:04:35.729> loose<00:04:35.909> then<00:04:36.539> through<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.139> thief<00:04:37.349> -

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
and be loose then through the thief -

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.129 
and be loose then through the thief -
yeah<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.909> nice<00:04:39.150> we<00:04:39.419> like<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.720> see<00:04:39.870> it's<00:04:40.050> just

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
yeah just nice we like to see it's just

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.249 
yeah just nice we like to see it's just
a<00:04:40.289> touch<00:04:40.500> more<00:04:40.530> forward<00:04:41.400> template<00:04:41.849> and

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
a touch more forward template and

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.279 
a touch more forward template and
exactly<00:04:43.259> I<00:04:43.409> can<00:04:43.440> go<00:04:43.710> in<00:04:43.889> between<00:04:44.360> :<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:46.169> know

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
exactly I can go in between : you know

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.950 
exactly I can go in between : you know
they<00:04:46.470> give<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.949> showing<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.400> in<00:04:47.960> is

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
they give you that showing it in is

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.959 
they give you that showing it in is
causes<00:04:49.710> lots<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.190> energy

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
causes lots of energy

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.059 
causes lots of energy
pick<00:04:51.179> up<00:04:51.329> a<00:04:51.449> step<00:04:51.689> straight<00:04:52.019> and<00:04:52.349> then<00:04:52.769> we<00:04:52.919> go

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
pick up a step straight and then we go

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.019 
pick up a step straight and then we go
again<00:04:53.369> yeah<00:04:53.929> good<00:04:54.929> and<00:04:55.439> straight<00:04:56.399> and<00:04:56.759> send

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
again yeah good and straight and send

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.949 
again yeah good and straight and send
forward<00:04:57.419> again

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:57.959 
forward again

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:03.109 
forward again
good<00:04:59.119> actually<00:05:00.119> it<00:05:00.269> again<00:05:00.539> I<00:05:01.729> like<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:02.909> one

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:03.119 
good actually it again I like this one

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.769 
good actually it again I like this one
the<00:05:03.269> best<00:05:03.389> over<00:05:03.929> there<00:05:04.110> yeah<00:05:04.519> there<00:05:05.519> we<00:05:05.669> go

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:05.779 
the best over there yeah there we go

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.419 
the best over there yeah there we go
okay<00:05:07.249> good

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:08.429 
okay good

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:12.229 
okay good
and<00:05:10.009> Jesse<00:05:11.009> that's<00:05:11.129> yeah<00:05:11.549> let's<00:05:11.909> do<00:05:12.059> the

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:12.239 
and Jesse that's yeah let's do the

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:14.139 
and Jesse that's yeah let's do the
opposite<00:05:12.989> also<00:05:13.319> with<00:05:13.439> the<00:05:13.529> same<00:05:13.739> idea

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:14.149 
opposite also with the same idea

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.839 
opposite also with the same idea
everything<00:05:15.149> just<00:05:15.299> a<00:05:15.479> touch<00:05:15.689> more<00:05:15.719> forward<00:05:16.849> no

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
everything just a touch more forward no

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.339 
everything just a touch more forward no
more<00:05:18.089> angle<00:05:18.539> in<00:05:18.689> this<00:05:20.449> very<00:05:21.449> good<00:05:21.749> and<00:05:21.959> been

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
more angle in this very good and been

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.129 
more angle in this very good and been
the<00:05:22.439> worst<00:05:22.649> Jesse<00:05:23.549> above<00:05:23.909> and<00:05:24.329> that's<00:05:24.479> great

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
the worst Jesse above and that's great

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.809 
the worst Jesse above and that's great
I've<00:05:25.379> been<00:05:25.529> in<00:05:25.619> verses<00:05:25.919> this<00:05:26.069> aesthetic<00:05:26.459> to

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
I've been in verses this aesthetic to

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.869 
I've been in verses this aesthetic to
the<00:05:26.969> conscious<00:05:27.869> in<00:05:28.079> we<00:05:28.259> can<00:05:28.439> donate<00:05:28.769> a<00:05:28.829> one<00:05:29.099> so

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
the conscious in we can donate a one so

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.759 
the conscious in we can donate a one so
they<00:05:30.059> come<00:05:30.269> to<00:05:30.299> this<00:05:30.539> but<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.349> next<00:05:31.589> step<00:05:31.619> that

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:31.769 
they come to this but the next step that

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.649 
they come to this but the next step that
this<00:05:32.099> force<00:05:32.369> would<00:05:32.579> be<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:33.089> do<00:05:33.239> the<00:05:33.419> little

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
this force would be to do the little

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.019 
this force would be to do the little
signal<00:05:34.019> and<00:05:34.259> once<00:05:34.379> on<00:05:34.589> the<00:05:34.619> diagonal<00:05:35.279> and<00:05:35.849> you

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
signal and once on the diagonal and you

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.850 
signal and once on the diagonal and you
go<00:05:36.179> on<00:05:36.299> the<00:05:36.360> diagonal<00:05:36.959> and<00:05:37.049> I'm<00:05:37.499> just<00:05:37.709> saying

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
go on the diagonal and I'm just saying

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.919 
go on the diagonal and I'm just saying
we're<00:05:37.979> trying<00:05:38.219> to<00:05:38.369> keep<00:05:38.549> the<00:05:39.119> shoulders<00:05:39.629> and

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:39.929 
we're trying to keep the shoulders and

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:42.649 
we're trying to keep the shoulders and
the<00:05:40.079> nine<00:05:40.289> now<00:05:41.159> we<00:05:41.669> need<00:05:41.999> to<00:05:42.119> up<00:05:42.299> just<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:42.629> little

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
the nine now we need to up just a little

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.109 
the nine now we need to up just a little
bit<00:05:42.899> and<00:05:43.529> before<00:05:43.739> we<00:05:44.009> know<00:05:44.189> we<00:05:44.489> have<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.639> perfect

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.119 
bit and before we know we have a perfect

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:49.399 
bit and before we know we have a perfect
setup<00:05:47.149> okay<00:05:48.149> baby

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
setup okay baby

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.009 
setup okay baby
Stefan<00:05:50.009> let<00:05:50.189> me<00:05:50.309> just<00:05:50.549> say<00:05:50.729> it's<00:05:51.360> important

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:52.019 
Stefan let me just say it's important

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.649 
Stefan let me just say it's important
that<00:05:52.079> with<00:05:52.860> Jesse's<00:05:53.429> horse<00:05:53.729> riding<00:05:54.329> our

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
that with Jesse's horse riding our

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.419 
that with Jesse's horse riding our
forward<00:05:55.139> and<00:05:55.319> then<00:05:55.439> letting<00:05:55.649> the<00:05:55.860> movement

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:56.429 
forward and then letting the movement

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:58.879 
forward and then letting the movement
collect<00:05:56.849> force<00:05:57.269> rather<00:05:57.959> than<00:05:58.229> trying<00:05:58.529> to<00:05:58.619> grow

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
collect force rather than trying to grow

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.069 
collect force rather than trying to grow
a<00:05:58.919> click-clack<00:05:59.399> before<00:06:00.329> you<00:06:00.449> lose<00:06:00.629> them<00:06:00.689> you

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:01.079 
a click-clack before you lose them you

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:02.719 
a click-clack before you lose them you
know<00:06:01.229> this<00:06:01.499> kind<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:01.889> course<00:06:02.129> that<00:06:02.279> just<00:06:02.489> makes

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
know this kind of course that just makes

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.409 
know this kind of course that just makes
him<00:06:02.789> too<00:06:03.119> slow<00:06:04.129> and<00:06:05.129> it<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.729> very<00:06:05.939> tempting

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
him too slow and it is very tempting

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.899 
him too slow and it is very tempting
with<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:07.259> forces<00:06:07.709> that<00:06:07.739> have<00:06:07.979> actually<00:06:08.550> a

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
with the forces that have actually a

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.179 
with the forces that have actually a
little<00:06:09.419> bit<00:06:09.599> more<00:06:09.779> cadence<00:06:10.289> and<00:06:10.649> Rebecca's

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
little bit more cadence and Rebecca's

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.669 
little bit more cadence and Rebecca's
swinging<00:06:11.579> this<00:06:11.789> it<00:06:12.689> is<00:06:12.809> very<00:06:12.839> tempting<00:06:13.319> to

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:13.679 
swinging this it is very tempting to

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.199 
swinging this it is very tempting to
write<00:06:13.829> everything<00:06:14.189> just<00:06:14.489> the<00:06:14.610> touch<00:06:14.909> slower

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:15.209 
write everything just the touch slower

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.029 
write everything just the touch slower
because<00:06:15.449> we<00:06:15.839> get<00:06:16.169> a<00:06:16.199> lot<00:06:16.469> of<00:06:16.499> movement

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
because we get a lot of movement

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.200 
because we get a lot of movement
underneath<00:06:17.610> us<00:06:17.819> but<00:06:18.479> that<00:06:18.629> doesn't

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.080 

activity<00:06:21.949> so<00:06:22.949> very<00:06:23.820> tempting<00:06:24.330> then<00:06:25.050> therefore

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
activity so very tempting then therefore

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.670 
activity so very tempting then therefore
to<00:06:27.090> be<00:06:27.210> also<00:06:27.360> important<00:06:28.050> to<00:06:28.139> have<00:06:28.229> somebody<00:06:28.500> on

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
to be also important to have somebody on

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.449 
to be also important to have somebody on
the<00:06:28.860> ground<00:06:29.449> okay
