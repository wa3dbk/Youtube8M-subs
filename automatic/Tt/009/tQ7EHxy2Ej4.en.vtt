00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.920
 and the vampire character with the second stage 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629
 hunger level when we reach the second 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.719

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.780
 imagine you are hungry and you need 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 move to any city at all in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.970
 any whiskey and there are people for example let's 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.970
 i don't know vaytran move 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:39.320
 choose talent he uses the key 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.900
 z according to the standard does not depend on time 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.420
 day day or night do not need sleeping 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.800
 the character is a very useful thing who is not 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:54.260
 knew maybe you knew about it well who didn't 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.990
 knew it would be useful to many do not like 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.580
 play for a vampire as it causes 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.930
 very big difficulties in existence 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.340
 you need to constantly drink blood 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.810
 whatever color but with this way i 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.270
 I think it will be pretty easy 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.840
 playing for a vampire will not be such 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.840
 great difficulty 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.530
 very long downloads I can not do anything 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.400
 do everything 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 it's my hard drive's fault 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.570
 you are at it at the same time 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.900
 writes fraps he generally starts hard then 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.900
 ovens 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.700
 what is the loading sting thank goodness and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 so look we are now vajtran vampire 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.700
 the second stage let's find the victim 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:30.270
 for example, he looks around on what 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.540
 nobody suspected this of us 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.540
 suspect and look 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.240
 a bunch of people, let's make it more 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.240
 realistic 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:04:02.950
 so what is it all together stand okay 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.950
 here we use talent 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.790
 everything is now under our control and 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.830
 calmly see yourself talking to her and here 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.680
 what would you like to do click 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:21.490
 eat but why am I saying that no one 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:27.650
 did not see as you see 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:36.820
 there will be adventures so let's run away 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:39.140
 from vaitran away I imagine 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.990
 people's surprise no reaction at all 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.669

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.230
 live yourself in the city here comes 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.290
 some strange masked man 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:53.919
 all people begin to drink blood is clear 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.919
 shocked 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.810
 but 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.100
 we finally booted 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.349

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.749
