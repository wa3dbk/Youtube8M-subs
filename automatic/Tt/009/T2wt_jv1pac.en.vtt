kind of a joke we all know it not that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
kind of a joke we all know it not that

they don't have some very talented women
over<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.970> they<00:00:48.150> just<00:00:48.269> don't<00:00:48.449> get

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
over there but they just don't get

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
over there but they just don't get
showcase<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.470> they<00:00:49.590> should<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.830> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
showcase the way that they should be and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
showcase the way that they should be and
they<00:00:50.790> really<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> display<00:00:51.840> their

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they really don't get to display their

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
they really don't get to display their
full<00:00:52.170> potential<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:53.129> look<00:00:53.190> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
full potential and it doesn't look like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
full potential and it doesn't look like
that's<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> change<00:00:53.940> anytime<00:00:54.210> soon<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that's going to change anytime soon and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
that's going to change anytime soon and
I'm<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.830> saying<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.250> what<00:00:56.519> TNA<00:00:56.790> is<00:00:56.909> doing

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
I'm not saying that what TNA is doing

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
I'm not saying that what TNA is doing
with<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> Knockouts<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.839> perfect<00:00:58.290> right<00:00:58.440> now

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
with the Knockouts is perfect right now

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.369 
with the Knockouts is perfect right now
but<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.580> are<00:00:59.610> at<00:00:59.909> least<00:01:00.089> better<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:01.110> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but they are at least better about this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.219 
but they are at least better about this
in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.650> double<00:01:01.860> w/e<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.659> you<00:01:03.659> know<00:01:03.720> generally

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in the double w/e and you know generally

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
in the double w/e and you know generally
I<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.500> find<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> knockout<00:01:05.070> division<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> be

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
I just find the knockout division to be

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.100 
I just find the knockout division to be
a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.790> interesting<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.659> fun<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.870> watch

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
a lot more interesting and fun to watch

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.560 
a lot more interesting and fun to watch
despite<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.740> flaws<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.180> show<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
despite the flaws and this show was a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.200 
despite the flaws and this show was a
lot<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:11.000> yeah<00:01:12.000> when<00:01:12.119> they

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
lot like that actually yeah when they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
lot like that actually yeah when they
first<00:01:12.450> announced<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.170> thought<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
first announced this I thought it was a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
first announced this I thought it was a
really<00:01:13.830> cool<00:01:14.159> idea<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.790> wasn't<00:01:15.479> expecting<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
really cool idea I wasn't expecting it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
really cool idea I wasn't expecting it
to<00:01:16.200> draw<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:16.650> ratings<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to draw big ratings just because of the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.359 
to draw big ratings just because of the
holidays<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.840> having<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.290> special<00:01:19.560> devoted<00:01:20.190> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
holidays but having a special devoted to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
holidays but having a special devoted to
their<00:01:20.520> women's<00:01:20.790> division<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:22.140> something

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
their women's division that's something

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
their women's division that's something
that<00:01:22.560> double<00:01:22.799> W<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.430> wouldn't<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that double W we just wouldn't do and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.029 
that double W we just wouldn't do and
anytime<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.229> say<00:01:25.469> that<00:01:25.649> it's<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.859> good

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
anytime you can say that it's a good

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.550 
anytime you can say that it's a good
thing<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.719> overall<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> show<00:01:28.170> came

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
thing and overall I think the show came

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
thing and overall I think the show came
off<00:01:28.770> fairly<00:01:29.070> well<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.609> know<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.000> wasn't

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
off fairly well you know it wasn't

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.499 
off fairly well you know it wasn't
perfect<00:01:30.450> by<00:01:30.750> any<00:01:30.780> means<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.530> did<00:01:31.859> enjoy<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
perfect by any means but I did enjoy it

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
perfect by any means but I did enjoy it
the<00:01:33.509> matches<00:01:33.840> were<00:01:33.869> longer<00:01:34.229> than<00:01:34.320> usual<00:01:34.560> they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the matches were longer than usual they

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
the matches were longer than usual they
didn't<00:01:35.520> hit<00:01:35.579> us<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.820> any<00:01:36.030> stupid<00:01:36.630> gimmicks

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
didn't hit us with any stupid gimmicks

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
didn't hit us with any stupid gimmicks
it<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.409> presented<00:01:37.619> seriously<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:39.240> leads

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it was presented seriously which leads

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
it was presented seriously which leads
me<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> believe<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.289> Scott<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
me to believe that it was Scott the more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.249 
me to believe that it was Scott the more
that<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.159> spearheading<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:42.259> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that was spearheading this thing and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.779 
that was spearheading this thing and
what<00:01:43.469> a<00:01:43.500> difference<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.979> makes<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
what a difference that makes you know I

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.940 
what a difference that makes you know I

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
ODB versus Tracy I think hamada versus

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.870 
ODB versus Tracy I think hamada versus
Roxy<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.960> best<00:02:19.140> match<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.530> night

hamada<00:02:20.880> was<00:02:21.090> easily<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> MVP<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.080> show

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.750 
hamada was easily the MVP of that show
and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.800> definitely<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.400> she<00:02:23.610> would<00:02:23.730> have

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and I definitely think she would have

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.040 
and I definitely think she would have
better<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.180> she<00:02:24.569> would<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.750> been<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> better

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
better but she would have been a better

better but she would have been a better

Wrecking<00:03:32.440> Crew<00:03:32.470> would<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:32.920> been<00:03:33.010> perfect

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
Wrecking Crew would have been perfect

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.009 
Wrecking Crew would have been perfect

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
but but now now you're just going to go

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.520 
but but now now you're just going to go
with<00:03:35.140> two<00:03:35.320> random<00:03:35.500> singles<00:03:36.010> wrestlers<00:03:36.400> and

with two random singles wrestlers and

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.350 
with two random singles wrestlers and
frankly<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:38.610> wasn't<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.820> impressed<00:03:39.880> with

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
frankly I wasn't that impressed with

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.479 
frankly I wasn't that impressed with
either<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.600> them<00:03:40.890> Lorelei<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.040> particular

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
either of them Lorelei in particular

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.830 
either of them Lorelei in particular
seemed<00:03:42.700> kind<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:42.970> unsure<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.330> herself<00:03:43.450> out

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
seemed kind of unsure of herself out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.070 
seemed kind of unsure of herself out
there<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.830> know<00:03:44.890> they<00:03:45.010> didn't<00:03:45.220> do<00:03:45.370> too<00:03:45.610> badly

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
there you know they didn't do too badly

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.600 
there you know they didn't do too badly
but<00:03:47.080> they<00:03:47.440> really<00:03:47.709> didn't<00:03:47.920> show<00:03:48.100> anything<00:03:48.370> to

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
but they really didn't show anything to

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.310 
but they really didn't show anything to
make<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> think<00:03:49.090> oh<00:03:49.239> my<00:03:49.390> god<00:03:49.600> TNA<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.140> sign

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
make you think oh my god TNA is to sign

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.979 
make you think oh my god TNA is to sign
these<00:03:50.500> women<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:51.040> know<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.690> hopefully<00:03:52.690> they

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
these women you know and hopefully they

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.509 
these women you know and hopefully they
won't<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.500> think<00:03:54.040> there<00:03:54.160> are<00:03:54.190> much<00:03:54.489> better

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
won't I think there are much better

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.819 
won't I think there are much better
female<00:03:55.090> talents<00:03:55.510> out<00:03:55.630> there<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.170> TNA<00:03:56.590> can<00:03:56.739> do

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
female talents out there and TNA can do

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.009 
female talents out there and TNA can do
a<00:03:56.860> lot<00:03:57.010> better<00:03:57.070> than<00:03:57.430> these<00:03:57.579> two<00:03:58.019> now

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
a lot better than these two now

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.990 
a lot better than these two now
according<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.530> spoilers<00:04:00.040> they<00:04:00.489> also<00:04:00.670> had

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
and a dark match that reportedly didn't

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.180 
and a dark match that reportedly didn't
go<00:04:05.350> very<00:04:05.380> well<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.890> was<00:04:06.010> full<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.280> botches

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190

amber<00:04:09.190> O'Neil<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.760> really<00:04:10.060> don't<00:04:10.239> care<00:04:10.299> about

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
amber O'Neil I really don't care about

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.470 
amber O'Neil I really don't care about
and<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.950> be<00:04:12.040> honest<00:04:12.400> I'm<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:13.329> not<00:04:13.420> that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
and to be honest I'm just not that

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.539 
and to be honest I'm just not that
familiar<00:04:13.780> with<00:04:14.170> Lizzie<00:04:14.410> Valentine<00:04:14.890> although

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
familiar with Lizzie Valentine although

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.770 
familiar with Lizzie Valentine although
I<00:04:15.579> do<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:15.970> she's<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> better<00:04:16.510> worker

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
I do know that she's a better worker

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.060 
I do know that she's a better worker
than<00:04:16.870> what<00:04:17.109> she<00:04:17.229> probably<00:04:17.470> showed<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:17.950> that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
than what she probably showed in that

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.800 
than what she probably showed in that
match<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.669> if<00:04:19.090> they<00:04:19.239> wanted<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.510> give<00:04:19.630> her

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
match so if they wanted to give her

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.000 
match so if they wanted to give her
another<00:04:20.019> look<00:04:20.229> at<00:04:20.350> some<00:04:20.560> point<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:20.950> guess

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
another look at some point I guess

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.600 
another look at some point I guess
that'd<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.280> all<00:04:21.430> right<00:04:22.350> but<00:04:23.350> anyway<00:04:23.710> as<00:04:24.400> for

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
that'd be all right but anyway as for

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.670 
that'd be all right but anyway as for
the<00:04:24.669> rest<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:24.970> show<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.530> enjoy<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the rest of the show I enjoy the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.790 
the rest of the show I enjoy the
tournament<00:04:27.100> itself<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:28.510> problem<00:04:29.080> was<00:04:29.320> what

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
tournament itself the problem was what

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.530 
tournament itself the problem was what
it<00:04:29.919> was<00:04:29.950> all<00:04:30.130> over<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.520> really<00:04:30.970> didn't<00:04:31.240> see<00:04:31.419> any

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
it was all over I really didn't see any

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.510 
it was all over I really didn't see any
reason<00:04:31.810> for<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.500> mean<00:04:32.860> apparently<00:04:33.310> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
reason for it I mean apparently the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.360 
reason for it I mean apparently the
point<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> whole<00:04:33.970> thing<00:04:34.150> was<00:04:34.750> 40<00:04:35.620> DB<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.220> go

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
point of the whole thing was 40 DB to go

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.040 
point of the whole thing was 40 DB to go
over<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.789> win<00:04:36.910> another<00:04:37.000> shot<00:04:37.419> at<00:04:37.539> Tara<00:04:37.780> and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
over and win another shot at Tara and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.080 
over and win another shot at Tara and
that's<00:04:38.770> just<00:04:38.890> stupid<00:04:39.340> for<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:39.729> couple<00:04:40.030> reasons

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
that's just stupid for a couple reasons

up better with Tara but they just went

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.910 
up better with Tara but they just went
with<00:05:10.240> ODB<00:05:10.690> again<00:05:10.960> which<00:05:11.230> made<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.740> whole

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
again I wasn't I mean it's definitely

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.490 
again I wasn't I mean it's definitely
time<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.120> elevate<00:05:28.540> some<00:05:28.690> new<00:05:28.810> challengers<00:05:29.350> for

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500

time to elevate some new challengers for
the<00:05:29.590> belt<00:05:29.800> but<00:05:30.310> they're<00:05:30.850> sticking<00:05:31.420> with<00:05:31.540> ODB

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
the belt but they're sticking with ODB

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.540 
the belt but they're sticking with ODB
for<00:05:32.110> right<00:05:32.260> now<00:05:32.290> which<00:05:32.740> I<00:05:32.980> don't<00:05:33.250> agree<00:05:33.460> with

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
for right now which I don't agree with

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.340 
for right now which I don't agree with
because<00:05:33.970> mean<00:05:34.570> her<00:05:34.750> title<00:05:35.050> brain<00:05:35.200> went

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
because mean her title brain went

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.650 
because mean her title brain went
absolutely<00:05:35.590> nowhere<00:05:35.950> I<00:05:36.370> mean<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.330> know<00:05:37.390> that

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
absolutely nowhere I mean I know that

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.720 
absolutely nowhere I mean I know that
Roxy<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.380> Alyssa<00:05:38.620> flash<00:05:38.980> are<00:05:39.220> both<00:05:39.340> injured

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
Roxy and Alyssa flash are both injured

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.410 
Roxy and Alyssa flash are both injured
and<00:05:40.470> they're<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.730> only<00:05:42.940> other<00:05:43.120> really

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
and they're the the only other really

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.240 
and they're the the only other really
viable<00:05:43.720> contenders<00:05:44.440> since<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.890> other<00:05:45.010> girls

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
viable contenders since the other girls

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.880 
viable contenders since the other girls
are<00:05:45.340> doing<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.640> tag<00:05:45.820> team<00:05:46.000> thing<00:05:46.240> right<00:05:46.420> now

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
are doing the tag team thing right now

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.890 
are doing the tag team thing right now
so<00:05:47.890> maybe<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.340> writers<00:05:48.670> feel<00:05:48.940> like<00:05:49.210> ODB<00:05:49.780> is

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
so maybe the writers feel like ODB is

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.560 
so maybe the writers feel like ODB is
the<00:05:50.020> best<00:05:50.230> option<00:05:50.470> for<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.830> time<00:05:51.040> being

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
the best option for the time being

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.360 
the best option for the time being
hopefully<00:05:52.570> when<00:05:52.720> those<00:05:52.900> two<00:05:53.110> heal<00:05:53.380> up<00:05:53.590> one<00:05:54.040> or

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
hopefully when those two heal up one or

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.950 
hopefully when those two heal up one or
both<00:05:54.670> of<00:05:54.730> them<00:05:55.000> will<00:05:55.180> get<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.360> shot<00:05:55.630> at<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.810> belt

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
both of them will get a shot at the belt

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.620 
both of them will get a shot at the belt
and<00:05:56.260> if<00:05:56.980> ODB<00:05:57.430> isn't<00:05:57.760> removed<00:05:58.090> from<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.330> title

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
and if ODB isn't removed from the title

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.450 
and if ODB isn't removed from the title
picture<00:05:58.810> then<00:05:59.350> at<00:05:59.740> least<00:05:59.890> there<00:06:00.310> would<00:06:00.400> be

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
picture then at least there would be

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.340 
picture then at least there would be
someone<00:06:01.150> else<00:06:01.480> in<00:06:01.690> there<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.990> kind<00:06:02.110> of<00:06:02.200> be<00:06:02.320> a

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
someone else in there to kind of be a

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.080 
someone else in there to kind of be a
buffer<00:06:02.410> between<00:06:02.770> her<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.340> taro<00:06:03.610> which<00:06:03.940> is

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
buffer between her and taro which is

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.930 
buffer between her and taro which is
something<00:06:04.360> that<00:06:04.450> I<00:06:04.510> think<00:06:04.630> they<00:06:04.900> need<00:06:05.940> having

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
something that I think they need having

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.110 
something that I think they need having
said<00:06:07.150> all<00:06:07.180> that<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:08.310> did<00:06:09.310> like<00:06:09.490> this<00:06:09.640> show<00:06:09.850> a<00:06:09.880> lot

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
said all that I did like this show a lot

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.670 
said all that I did like this show a lot
I<00:06:10.360> thought<00:06:10.930> this<00:06:11.080> was<00:06:11.140> one<00:06:11.380> of<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:11.530> more

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
I thought this was one of the more

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.770 
I thought this was one of the more
enjoyable<00:06:12.070> TV<00:06:12.610> shows<00:06:12.850> the<00:06:13.060> TNA<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.390> put<00:06:13.570> on<00:06:13.660> in

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
enjoyable TV shows the TNA is put on in

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.270 
enjoyable TV shows the TNA is put on in
a<00:06:13.840> while<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.290> mean<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.680> tournament<00:06:15.070> would<00:06:15.160> have

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
a while I mean the tournament would have

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.890 
a while I mean the tournament would have
been<00:06:15.400> better<00:06:15.610> if<00:06:15.730> sarita<00:06:16.240> and<00:06:16.420> Taylor<00:06:16.720> had

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
been better if sarita and Taylor had

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.690 
been better if sarita and Taylor had
been<00:06:17.020> in<00:06:17.140> it<00:06:17.260> instead<00:06:17.410> of<00:06:17.710> Tracy<00:06:18.160> and<00:06:18.400> velvet

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
been in it instead of Tracy and velvet

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.390 
been in it instead of Tracy and velvet
sky<00:06:18.910> but<00:06:19.840> now<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.770> still<00:06:21.070> thought<00:06:21.190> it<00:06:21.310> was

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
sky but now I still thought it was

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.950 
sky but now I still thought it was
pretty<00:06:21.580> good<00:06:21.820> even<00:06:22.150> if<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.510> didn't<00:06:22.720> agree<00:06:22.900> with

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
pretty good even if I didn't agree with

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.700 
pretty good even if I didn't agree with
the<00:06:23.140> winner<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.910> guess<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.840> failure<00:06:26.260> of<00:06:26.290> New

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
the winner so I guess the failure of New

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.290 
the winner so I guess the failure of New
Year's<00:06:26.950> knockout<00:06:27.370> Eve<00:06:27.580> was<00:06:27.820> that<00:06:27.970> it<00:06:28.090> didn't

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
Year's knockout Eve was that it didn't

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.530 
Year's knockout Eve was that it didn't
really<00:06:28.480> break<00:06:28.720> any<00:06:28.930> new<00:06:28.960> ground<00:06:29.140> creatively

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
really break any new ground creatively

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.690 
really break any new ground creatively
mostly<00:06:31.540> they<00:06:31.660> just<00:06:31.690> set<00:06:32.260> up<00:06:32.380> Tara<00:06:32.710> vs<00:06:33.070> 0<00:06:33.190> DB<00:06:33.520> for

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
mostly they just set up Tara vs 0 DB for

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.610 
mostly they just set up Tara vs 0 DB for
the<00:06:33.760> January<00:06:34.150> fourth<00:06:34.450> show<00:06:34.720> which<00:06:35.080> probably

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
the January fourth show which probably

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.680 
the January fourth show which probably
would<00:06:35.860> have<00:06:35.950> happened<00:06:36.280> anyway<00:06:36.340> I<00:06:36.850> mean<00:06:37.570> they

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
would have happened anyway I mean they

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.450 
would have happened anyway I mean they
did<00:06:38.110> they<00:06:38.260> did<00:06:38.410> do<00:06:38.530> a<00:06:38.560> good<00:06:38.740> job<00:06:38.800> of<00:06:39.040> hyping

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
did they did do a good job of hyping

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.010 
did they did do a good job of hyping
that<00:06:39.550> at<00:06:39.640> the<00:06:39.730> end<00:06:39.940> but<00:06:40.300> I<00:06:40.510> just<00:06:40.720> don't<00:06:40.900> think

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
that at the end but I just don't think

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.500 
that at the end but I just don't think
the<00:06:41.230> match<00:06:41.380> is<00:06:41.500> going<00:06:41.590> to<00:06:41.650> deliver<00:06:41.890> that<00:06:42.010> much

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
the match is going to deliver that much

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.870 
the match is going to deliver that much
and<00:06:43.600> I<00:06:44.320> mean<00:06:44.500> frankly<00:06:44.830> I'm<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.610> lot<00:06:45.820> more

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
and I mean frankly I'm a lot more

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.490 
and I mean frankly I'm a lot more
interested<00:06:46.420> to<00:06:46.510> see<00:06:46.690> Cerreta<00:06:47.050> and<00:06:47.140> Taylor

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
interested to see Cerreta and Taylor

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.740 
interested to see Cerreta and Taylor
versus<00:06:47.830> Kong<00:06:48.040> and<00:06:48.160> Hamada<00:06:48.460> me<00:06:49.390> if<00:06:49.480> they<00:06:49.600> give

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
versus Kong and Hamada me if they give

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.180 
versus Kong and Hamada me if they give
if<00:06:50.020> they<00:06:50.140> give<00:06:50.290> those<00:06:50.440> girls<00:06:50.620> enough<00:06:50.950> time

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
if they give those girls enough time

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.280 
if they give those girls enough time
that<00:06:51.370> could<00:06:51.460> be<00:06:51.580> a<00:06:51.610> great<00:06:51.970> match<00:06:52.240> so<00:06:52.810> I<00:06:53.140> mean

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
that could be a great match so I mean

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.080 
that could be a great match so I mean
that's<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.830> man<00:06:53.980> I'm<00:06:54.160> looking<00:06:54.400> forward<00:06:54.640> to<00:06:54.880> I

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
that's the man I'm looking forward to I

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.750 
that's the man I'm looking forward to I
mean<00:06:55.870> if<00:06:56.080> they'd<00:06:56.500> put<00:06:56.740> Cerreta<00:06:57.040> and<00:06:57.160> Taylor<00:06:57.580> in

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
mean if they'd put Cerreta and Taylor in

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.490 
mean if they'd put Cerreta and Taylor in
this<00:06:57.910> tournament<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.540> used<00:06:58.810> it<00:06:58.990> to<00:06:59.020> build<00:06:59.290> up

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
this tournament and used it to build up

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.810 
this tournament and used it to build up
their<00:06:59.650> match<00:06:59.800> with<00:06:59.980> Kong<00:07:00.160> and<00:07:00.280> Hamada<00:07:00.610> on

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
their match with Kong and Hamada on

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.790 
their match with Kong and Hamada on
Monday<00:07:01.240> instead<00:07:01.510> of<00:07:02.050> just<00:07:02.230> announcing<00:07:02.680> it

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
Monday instead of just announcing it

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.560 
Monday instead of just announcing it
backstage<00:07:03.250> that<00:07:03.940> would<00:07:04.120> have<00:07:04.240> been<00:07:04.300> a<00:07:04.360> lot

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
backstage that would have been a lot

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.850 
backstage that would have been a lot
better<00:07:04.630> than<00:07:04.990> what<00:07:05.110> they<00:07:05.230> did<00:07:05.380> with<00:07:05.440> April<00:07:05.770> and

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
better than what they did with April and

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.690 
better than what they did with April and
Lorelei<00:07:06.300> but<00:07:07.300> anyway<00:07:07.570> I<00:07:08.220> did<00:07:09.220> like<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.520> show

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
Lorelei but anyway I did like the show

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.970 
Lorelei but anyway I did like the show
in<00:07:09.820> its<00:07:09.940> own<00:07:10.090> merits<00:07:10.480> yeah<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.530> was<00:07:11.650> kind<00:07:11.860> of<00:07:11.890> a

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
in its own merits yeah it was kind of a

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.160 
in its own merits yeah it was kind of a
missed<00:07:12.190> opportunity<00:07:12.310> in<00:07:12.970> some<00:07:13.180> ways<00:07:13.390> I<00:07:13.720> mean

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
missed opportunity in some ways I mean

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.330 
missed opportunity in some ways I mean
they<00:07:14.680> had<00:07:14.860> the<00:07:14.980> chance<00:07:15.250> to<00:07:16.650> they<00:07:17.650> had<00:07:17.980> chances

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
they had the chance to they had chances

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.130 
they had the chance to they had chances
to<00:07:18.400> do<00:07:18.580> some<00:07:18.910> more<00:07:19.000> productive<00:07:19.570> things<00:07:19.600> and

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
to do some more productive things and

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.960 
to do some more productive things and
they<00:07:20.200> just<00:07:20.410> didn't<00:07:20.710> but<00:07:21.430> it<00:07:21.460> wasn't<00:07:21.760> a<00:07:21.820> bad

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:21.970 
they just didn't but it wasn't a bad

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.000 
they just didn't but it wasn't a bad
show<00:07:22.330> I<00:07:22.630> mean<00:07:23.050> in<00:07:23.170> terms<00:07:23.350> of<00:07:23.560> writing<00:07:23.800> and

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
show I mean in terms of writing and

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.560 
show I mean in terms of writing and
booking<00:07:24.370> it<00:07:24.490> was<00:07:24.580> one<00:07:25.120> of<00:07:25.210> the<00:07:25.270> better<00:07:25.450> shows

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
booking it was one of the better shows

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.040 
booking it was one of the better shows
tna's<00:07:26.200> had<00:07:26.380> in<00:07:26.500> awhile<00:07:26.590> so<00:07:27.660> wasn't<00:07:28.660> perfect

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
tna's had in awhile so wasn't perfect

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.130 
tna's had in awhile so wasn't perfect
but<00:07:29.650> it<00:07:29.710> could<00:07:30.280> have<00:07:30.370> been<00:07:30.400> so<00:07:30.670> much<00:07:30.700> worse<00:07:31.140> so

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.140 
but it could have been so much worse so

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.200 
but it could have been so much worse so
for<00:07:32.890> the<00:07:32.950> first<00:07:33.100> time<00:07:33.370> doing<00:07:33.730> a<00:07:33.820> knockout
