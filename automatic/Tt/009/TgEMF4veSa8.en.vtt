in<00:00:04.529> previous<00:00:05.370> videos<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.970> should<00:00:06.120> have

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
in previous videos you should have

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.849 
in previous videos you should have
learned<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:06.839> set<00:00:07.140> up<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.500> fill<00:00:07.710> out

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
like in this video you will learn how to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.230 
like in this video you will learn how to
apply<00:00:14.040> knowledge<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.639> incomplete<00:00:15.210> dominance

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
apply knowledge of incomplete dominance

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.140 
apply knowledge of incomplete dominance
to<00:00:15.809> punnett<00:00:16.109> squares<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> image<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.029> this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
incomplete dominance setting up punnett

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
incomplete dominance setting up punnett
squares<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> same<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
squares is about the same but the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.599 
squares is about the same but the
interpretation<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.650> results<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.189> different

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
interpretation the results is different

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.960
