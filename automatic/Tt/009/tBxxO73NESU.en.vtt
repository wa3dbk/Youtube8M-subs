foundation<00:01:56.219> because<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:57.149> skin<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.509> really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
foundation because my skin is really

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990 
foundation because my skin is really
sensitive<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.500> lights<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.520> embarrassment

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
sensitive to lights and to embarrassment

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.719 
sensitive to lights and to embarrassment

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
so I break out in hives and redness a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.179 
so I break out in hives and redness a
lot<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.210> can't<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.869> BB<00:02:04.290> creams<00:02:04.590> or<00:02:04.829> CC

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.120 
creams or those
things<00:02:06.230> because<00:02:06.500> they<00:02:06.650> don't<00:02:06.800> have<00:02:06.860> enough

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
thing I wish it had that it doesn't is

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.510 
thing I wish it had that it doesn't is
it<00:03:17.690> only<00:03:17.870> has<00:03:18.140> on/off<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:19.070> doesn't<00:03:19.370> have<00:03:19.489> a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
it only has on/off it doesn't have a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.670 
it only has on/off it doesn't have a
temperature<00:03:19.760> setting<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.510> also<00:03:20.660> came<00:03:21.050> with<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
temperature setting it also came with a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.460 
temperature setting it also came with a
straightener<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.610> assume<00:03:23.120> because<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.320> all

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
straightener I assume because it was all

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.720 
straightener I assume because it was all
in<00:03:24.560> one<00:03:24.590> package<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.370> straightener

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
in one package that the straightener

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.640 
in one package that the straightener
might<00:03:25.970> not<00:03:26.150> be<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.540> great<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
might not be that great and the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.710 
might not be that great and the
straightener<00:03:28.070> is<00:03:28.100> really<00:03:28.700> great<00:03:28.910> knack<00:03:29.300> yeah

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
straightener is really great knack yeah

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.870 
straightener is really great knack yeah
