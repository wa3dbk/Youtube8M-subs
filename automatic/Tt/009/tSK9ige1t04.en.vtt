00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.019
 this job is imaging technologists 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.609
 medical 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.250
 so here is jessica radiology scanner 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.439
 irm technical devices often 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.400
 impressive essential to the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.900
 medicine today 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 jessica handle them under the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.550
 doctor's responsibility she places the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 patient in proper position and realizes 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 the image is very important 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 to welcome the patient with a smile 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 to be able to explain to him what is going to happen 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.410
 pass and then tell him that everything is going 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 well be that we are always there in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.309
 contact with him one must love the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 collaborative work that's all the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.570
 time every day we work at 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 less by two is what we like 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.230
 to work in team attention 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
 jessica is not limited to pressing 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.890
 buttons his job requires a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.219
 perfect knowledge of anatomy 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.379
 human 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.180
 and then beyond the ideal technique 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.090
 to patients via not precisely that this 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.439
 technical side machine ya name this side 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.050
 human that is very important we are in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.390
 contact with patients 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.970
 we must enormously reassure patients 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 because this review that can do 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 afraid in the majority of cases obviously 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 the job of jessica is above all 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.300
 technical 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.930
 these equipments must be understood 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.850
 control here the error is prohibited 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 it requires treasures of precaution 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.360
 and a nice bag of knowledge 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.380
 that's what's very interesting 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 it's an evolving profession 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.420
 constant 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.160
 there are techniques now that they 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 are more or less arrive at the end but 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.910
 techniques like resonance 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 magnetic that is not his goal is 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.110
 so that allows us to continue to have 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 training to enable 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.360
 continue to evolve to learn from 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.590
 new things 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 the qualities of the technologies are that 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.440
 very wide it is necessary especially to have already had 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.560
 a good contact patients have a contact 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.330
 important human you have to be able to have 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 a high degree of organization requires 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.800
 to be able to be autonomous 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 studies are quite pushed especially from the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.530
 physical scientific point of view the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.810
 mathematics but the outcome is 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 very valued but I find it really 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.060
 interesting thanks to a salon 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.709
 the student 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 I discovered imaging studies 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.590
 medical and so after three years 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.030
 here we go out with his diploma and in 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 the majority of cases we find enough 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 quickly birch an x-ray 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.880
 is a medical act 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.709
 therefore jessica is held in respect 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.120
 very strict procedures and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.570
 requirements of the manufacturer of 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.420
 the device 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.650
 the security here is absolute for sure 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420
 do not forget that for example 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.570
 good for the scanner and the radio these are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.000
 x-rays so they're still 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.770
 harmful to high dose need to be very 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.500
 attention for example for resonance 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.780
 that patients are well 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.800
 clothes in the cabin does not come in with 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.870
 something metallic 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 we must obviously pay attention to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.959
 hygiene in the morning when we arrive 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.610
 change of clothes 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.460
 and then yes it's between each patient 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.990
 to disinfect your hands 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.120
 passions that at the end of the agent end 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.020
 at the end of his exam gets up and thank you 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.890
 for your kindness 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.720
 they leave in quotation marks to reassure 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.990
 will it be our way to bring them 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990
 Something 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.360
 my job is
