of<00:01:36.270> goalkeeper<00:01:36.869> console<00:01:37.380> I'll<00:01:37.770> guess<00:01:38.070> he<00:01:38.250> will

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of goalkeeper console I'll guess he will

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
of goalkeeper console I'll guess he will
stay<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> best<00:01:39.150> keep<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> till<00:01:39.840> team<00:01:40.140> of

stay as the best keep on till team of
the<00:01:40.530> season<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.030> his<00:01:42.150> price

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the season so I don't think his price

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.149 
the season so I don't think his price
will<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.229> maybe<00:01:43.500> go<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.950> little

is the squat and I will play with it in
this<00:03:10.380> episode<00:03:10.770> but<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.340> fitness<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.730> pretty

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
this episode but the fitness is pretty

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.510 
this episode but the fitness is pretty
low<00:03:12.210> so<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:12.750> start<00:03:13.080> off<00:03:13.200> by<00:03:13.380> going<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.980> 43

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
low so we start off by going with the 43

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.420 
low so we start off by going with the 43
it's<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.300> side<00:03:15.750> they're<00:03:16.050> going<00:03:17.010> into<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it's you one side they're going into the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.729 
it's you one side they're going into the
amount<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.700> 16th<00:03:18.150> off<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.900> gold<00:03:19.170> cup<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
amount of 16th off the gold cup and I

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.500 
amount of 16th off the gold cup and I
will<00:03:19.890> eventually<00:03:20.340> match<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:21.000> against<00:03:21.420> an

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
will eventually match up against an

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.630 
will eventually match up against an
opponent<00:03:21.810> here<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.380> then<00:03:22.650> he<00:03:23.220> did<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
opponent here and then he did have a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.690 
opponent here and then he did have a
pretty<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.660> guess<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.200> normal<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.250> Premier<00:03:26.580> Li

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
pretty I guess is normal and Premier Li

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.760 
pretty I guess is normal and Premier Li

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
bit so it was a gamer it was difficult

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880

to<00:03:45.150> get<00:03:45.390> any<00:03:45.570> skill<00:03:45.900> moves<00:03:46.110> going<00:03:46.350> really<00:03:46.620> but

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
to get any skill moves going really but

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.400

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
and I will manage to get a chance here

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.229 
and I will manage to get a chance here
into<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> second<00:03:50.220> half<00:03:50.250> here<00:03:50.489> going<00:03:50.820> past<00:03:51.030> two

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
into the second half here going past two

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.790 
into the second half here going past two
defenders<00:03:51.390> with<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> skill<00:03:52.170> moves<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.590> we

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
defenders with the skill moves if we

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190 
defenders with the skill moves if we
won't<00:03:52.980> go<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.400> gravity<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.510> does<00:03:54.840> hit

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
won't go with gravity but it does hit

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.890 
won't go with gravity but it does hit
the<00:03:55.440> post<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.010> then<00:03:56.100> 87th<00:03:56.850> minute<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.300> get<00:03:57.660> a

bit<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.140> luck<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.530> taglib<00:03:58.950> all<00:03:59.100> 22<00:03:59.520> wrapped

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
bit of luck and taglib all 22 wrapped

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.180 
bit of luck and taglib all 22 wrapped
and<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.239> will<00:04:00.450> make<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.840> one<00:04:01.080> nil<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.560> one

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and that will make it one nil and one

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.949 
and that will make it one nil and one

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
corner phones and then I wanted to play

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.409 
corner phones and then I wanted to play
with<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.590> dog<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.459> new<00:04:17.609> sign<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.880> just<00:04:18.209> built

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
couldn't do anything about this but how

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.930 
couldn't do anything about this but how
unlucky<00:05:44.900> do<00:05:45.110> this<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.440> deflection<00:05:46.219> go<00:05:46.550> there<00:05:46.759> to

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
unlucky do this a deflection go there to

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.850 
unlucky do this a deflection go there to
make<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:47.419> 2-1<00:05:47.659> and<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.169> is<00:05:48.319> how<00:05:48.469> the<00:05:48.529> game

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
make it 2-1 and that is how the game

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.279 
make it 2-1 and that is how the game
will<00:05:49.009> end<00:05:49.190> so<00:05:49.880> this<00:05:50.029> was<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.270> truly<00:05:50.719> not<00:05:51.020> one<00:05:51.259> of

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
will end so this was a truly not one of

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.409 
will end so this was a truly not one of
my<00:05:51.560> good<00:05:51.830> at<00:05:52.009> games<00:05:52.279> nothing<00:05:52.729> went<00:05:53.029> my<00:05:53.180> way<00:05:53.389> I

trailing<00:06:28.130> by<00:06:28.400> two<00:06:28.460> and<00:06:28.849> i<00:06:28.909> won't<00:06:29.090> get<00:06:29.240> back<00:06:29.509> in

trailing by two and i won't get back in

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.120

the<00:06:29.930> start<00:06:30.169> of<00:06:30.259> the<00:06:30.289> first<00:06:30.529> half<00:06:30.770> year<00:06:30.919> with

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
the start of the first half year with

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.920 
the start of the first half year with
Ibrahimovic<00:06:31.669> other<00:06:32.029> second<00:06:32.300> half<00:06:32.419> I<00:06:32.569> mean<00:06:32.750> and

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
Ibrahimovic other second half I mean and

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.920 
Ibrahimovic other second half I mean and
then<00:06:33.650> I<00:06:34.069> thought<00:06:34.789> this<00:06:34.940> was<00:06:35.089> a<00:06:35.149> free<00:06:35.240> kick<00:06:35.630> but

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
then I thought this was a free kick but

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.389 
then I thought this was a free kick but
I<00:06:35.960> will<00:06:36.110> get<00:06:36.440> a<00:06:36.469> little<00:06:36.710> bit<00:06:36.919> later<00:06:37.130> in<00:06:37.370> the

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
I will get a little bit later in the

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.219 
I will get a little bit later in the
19th<00:06:37.729> minute<00:06:38.000> because<00:06:38.300> he<00:06:38.719> played<00:06:38.930> also

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
19th minute because he played also

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.030 
19th minute because he played also
defense<00:06:39.529> if<00:06:39.649> I<00:06:39.740> might

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
defense if I might

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.730 
defense if I might
couldn't<00:06:40.310> break<00:06:40.490> him<00:06:40.520> down<00:06:40.670> whatsoever<00:06:41.740> so

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
couldn't break him down whatsoever so

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.470 
couldn't break him down whatsoever so
this<00:06:43.220> was<00:06:43.400> pretty<00:06:43.640> much<00:06:43.760> my<00:06:43.820> only<00:06:44.180> other

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
this was pretty much my only other

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.630 
this was pretty much my only other
chance<00:06:44.750> apart<00:06:45.170> from<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.530> goalie<00:06:45.770> baby<00:06:46.070> steps
