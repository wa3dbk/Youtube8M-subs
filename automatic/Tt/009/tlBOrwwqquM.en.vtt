00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.080
 Welcome to the ready for aging 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.810
 guide the second bus of assad ions 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.849
 the awful in the minutes I want 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.490
 you the trailer mode of this fight 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.459
 closer to bring the picture material 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 comes from the guild revenge of the server 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.119
 t 3 in the 4th 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.800
 the general process is exactly like in the 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.259
 story-mode that means you fight 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.169
 first then marries doubtfully and 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.730
 last as the entire abilities of 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.720
 easier difficulty 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.660
 also still available 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.570
 That means marriage works in this phase 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.000
 again the seething chain where you then 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.710
 First bring iphos shield down 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.600
 and could break the magician 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.030
 besides, there is still the one here 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.660
 mavs the shattered tanks to the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.270
 the ba attacked by the crushed which of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.550
 cellar is triggered and soap it up 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.530
 the opposite side makes a skewer 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.890
 Attack of one bleed the baw inter 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.870
 leaves 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 That's why the tanks should be here 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 continue to stack after about five 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.610
 switch 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.440
 how exactly he does it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.140
 leave the tanks to the position 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.750
 change or the bosses you have to know 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.090
 new in heavy mode is now here in 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.430
 this first phase the flash falls 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.830
 both berra and also jump 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.190
 soap to marriage in the middle 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.500
 The two then act as lightning 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 on marriage and this begins 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.640
 to create a field of vision that kind of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.920
 makes storm is of course there's to it 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.510
 again the usual warning message and if 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.220
 have this then you should deal 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.460
 run best so 20 meters or 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.680
 similar is because otherwise the damage 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.670
 could skip between you and 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.030
 player die 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.369
 that was phase one we come to phase 2 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.150
 there is still that in this one 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.549
 condemn 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.369
 now, however, she gets three piles 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.350
 from there and not only two would 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.049
 so pick up three green 14 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.369
 In addition , now gets a choking 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.530
 attack that means he jumps to one 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.630
 random player down and the throttle 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.380
 this player can do this 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.270
 do nothing 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.140
 you should therefore other players 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.810
 always divide that goal 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.850
 run or from the far am 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.390
 strangers thus hinder the magic 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.400
 abort, stop 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.450
 then we are already at the end 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.069
 from phase 2 we come to phase 3 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.540
 from the normal mode you can 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.920
 certainly the death marks 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.050
 this gives a nice yellow ray 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.989
 which marks the player and then 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.940
 before kelterer has to walk away 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.500
 on the other hand , now it's the eyes 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.000
 that only affects the tanks 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.370
 or the healers have to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.110
 Know what the current thinks 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.209
 So this power makes you suck 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.670
 As a result, he can virtually no cure 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.720
 because every cure is around 90 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.730
 percent reduced 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.860
 the bad thing is actually 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 that he really did not heal 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.720
 may be because if he is healed 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.360
 even if the cure is only eight or 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 ten points he is already enormous 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.269
 harm pure and also goes the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.400
 cure ankara that tank the that 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.400
 makes suck meets the must immediately 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.329
 bigger run away and the other muscle 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040
 sarah scoff 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.290
 that's almost how we are 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.480
 through the last ability here in the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.209
 third phase is the clear 3 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 terrible summons that happens a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.720
 or twice in the phase 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.610
 luckily they do not have much 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.799
 many hit points that is the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.500
 should you as macher then quickly times 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.730
 away jews and then you can 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.920
 take care of children again 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.400
 that was all worth knowing about hard 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.959
 Mode of fear watch as usual 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.980
 you can do it all ready again 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.980
 for aging
