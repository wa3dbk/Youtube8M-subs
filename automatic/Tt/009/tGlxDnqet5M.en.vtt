00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
a common problem that I see and I want

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.230 
a common problem that I see and I want
to<00:00:14.070> address<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.490> today<00:00:14.730> um<00:00:16.550> it's<00:00:17.550> good<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.029> have

jackpot to something different because
it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.969> working<00:00:48.210> instead<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.410> trying<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's not working instead of trying to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
it's not working instead of trying to
diagnose<00:00:51.030> their<00:00:51.239> fundamentals<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.110> if

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
diagnose their fundamentals and see if

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080 
diagnose their fundamentals and see if
that's<00:00:52.410> something<00:00:52.649> you'd<00:00:52.920> affixed<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> mean

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this way I've got two different ropes

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
this way I've got two different ropes
that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.219> cooler

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that I use and and one is for cooler

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
that I use and and one is for cooler
weather<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.690> warmer<00:01:03.989> weather

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
weather and one is for warmer weather

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.770 
weather and one is for warmer weather
and<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> only<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

up here where I'm around Kansas City and
this<00:01:50.100> rope<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.970> consistent<00:01:51.329> for<00:01:51.689> us<00:01:51.810> up

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
this rope is really consistent for us up

here it's a it's a bigger rope it's a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.480 
here it's a it's a bigger rope it's a
heavier<00:01:54.450> rope<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.770> last<00:01:56.070> forever

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
heavier rope and it these last forever

when<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> gets<00:01:57.719> really<00:01:57.990> hot<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
when it gets really hot in the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
when it gets really hot in the
summertime<00:01:59.460> I'll<00:01:59.820> switch<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.509> these

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
summertime I'll switch to these

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.510 
summertime I'll switch to these

that's<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.590> way<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.790> work<00:02:19.909> on<00:02:20.120> your

that's one way that you can work on your
consistency<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.079> pick<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> rope<00:02:21.829> you<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:22.670> if

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
consistency is pick a rope you know if

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.460 
consistency is pick a rope you know if
you're<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.269> you're<00:02:23.299> an<00:02:23.540> intermediate<00:02:23.780> lower

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.000 
back and forward probably isn't the
problem<00:02:56.659> it's<00:02:57.019> probably<00:02:57.079> something<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.889> do

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
problem it's probably something to do

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.790 
problem it's probably something to do
