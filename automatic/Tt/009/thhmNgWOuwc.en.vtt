threat of asteroids well my question is

threat of asteroids well my question is
is<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> fact<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:09.539> only<00:02:09.810> are

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
is that the fact that they only are

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
is that the fact that they only are
spotting<00:02:10.530> ten<00:02:10.830> percent<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:12.690> they

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
spotting ten percent or are they

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.190 
spotting ten percent or are they
spotting

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
spotting

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
or what do they know have they spotted
