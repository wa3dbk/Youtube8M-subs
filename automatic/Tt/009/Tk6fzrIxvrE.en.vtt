00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
pressure in the movie which we see to

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.029 
pressure in the movie which we see to
maintain<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.089> certain<00:00:44.510> persona<00:00:44.839> and<00:00:45.410> play<00:00:45.949> up

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
maintain a certain persona and play up

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.950 
maintain a certain persona and play up
to<00:00:46.160> what<00:00:46.309> she<00:00:46.339> thinks<00:00:46.760> people<00:00:47.300> want<00:00:47.510> her<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.780> be

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
to what she thinks people want her to be

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.540 
to what she thinks people want her to be
is<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.769> something<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.370> could<00:00:49.519> really

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
is that something that you could really

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.590 
is that something that you could really
relate<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.359> when<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:50.719> were<00:00:50.839> preparing<00:00:52.600> yeah

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
relate to when you were preparing yeah

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.649 
relate to when you were preparing yeah
sure<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.469> think<00:00:54.739> every<00:00:55.550> character<00:00:56.269> in<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
sure I think every character in the

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.450 
sure I think every character in the
movie<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.379> under<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.890> same<00:00:58.100> amount<00:00:58.399> of

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
movie is under the same amount of

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.899 
movie is under the same amount of
pressure

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
pressure

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.479 
pressure
I<00:00:59.059> think<00:00:59.749> she's<00:01:00.379> putting<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:00.920> herself<00:01:01.280> a

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
I think she's putting it on herself a

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.250 
I think she's putting it on herself a
lot<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.940> kind<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.179> keep<00:01:02.390> up<00:01:02.569> to<00:01:02.749> this<00:01:02.870> facade

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
lot to kind of keep up to this facade

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.300 
lot to kind of keep up to this facade
that<00:01:03.319> she's<00:01:03.829> maintaining<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:05.720> me<00:01:06.310> there's

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
that she's maintaining for me there's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.100 
that she's maintaining for me there's
definitely<00:01:07.850> pressure<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:08.479> I<00:01:08.510> put<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.870> all<00:01:08.990> on

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
definitely pressure but I put it all on

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.740 
definitely pressure but I put it all on
myself<00:01:09.260> too<00:01:09.680> yeah<00:01:10.070> it's<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.580> I'd<00:01:11.330> rather<00:01:11.479> feel

actually<00:01:53.689> decided<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.350> was<00:01:54.500> gonna<00:01:54.619> wax<00:01:55.189> it<00:01:55.549> all

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
actually decided I was gonna wax it all

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.190 
actually decided I was gonna wax it all
off<00:01:55.850> at<00:01:56.000> one<00:01:56.179> time<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.630> make<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.840> into<00:01:57.170> our

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
off at one time and to make it into our

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.230 
off at one time and to make it into our
wig<00:01:57.469> that<00:01:58.159> I<00:01:58.250> could<00:01:58.429> stick<00:01:58.609> on<00:01:58.700> when<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:58.969> wanted

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
wig that I could stick on when I wanted

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.219 
wig that I could stick on when I wanted
because<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.539> people<00:01:59.689> used<00:01:59.929> to<00:01:59.990> bleach<00:02:00.200> my

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
because you people used to bleach my

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.039 
because you people used to bleach my
eyebrows<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:00.829> much<00:02:01.179> again<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.210> think<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.840> was
