okay
uh-huh<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.930> then<00:04:29.080> just<00:04:29.290> kind<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.470> stir<00:04:29.680> this

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
uh-huh and then just kind of stir this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.190 
uh-huh and then just kind of stir this
up<00:04:29.950> that's<00:04:30.550> why<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.820> only<00:04:31.210> empty<00:04:31.600> out<00:04:31.750> half<00:04:32.050> of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
up that's why you only empty out half of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.500 
up that's why you only empty out half of
the<00:04:32.290> liquid<00:04:32.470> they<00:04:32.710> can<00:04:32.830> using<00:04:33.130> or<00:04:33.340> have<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.300> be

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
the liquid they can using or have to be

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.680 
the liquid they can using or have to be
liquid<00:04:34.990> them<00:04:35.110> again<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:37.300> I'm<00:04:37.420> sure<00:04:37.450> could

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
liquid them again and I'm sure could

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.590 
liquid them again and I'm sure could
stir<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:37.990> up<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:39.790> once<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.420> is

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
stir this up and I and then once this is

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.690 
stir this up and I and then once this is
finished<00:04:40.780> cooking<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.380> will<00:04:41.560> mix<00:04:42.490> them<00:04:42.580> all

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
finished cooking I will mix them all

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.360 
finished cooking I will mix them all
together<00:04:42.850> so<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:47.320> past<00:04:47.500> doesn't<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:47.830> done<00:04:48.040> I

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
together so the past doesn't have done I

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.370
