00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 as everyone already knows 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.960
 Metal of 5 was announced last week 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 was shown in the 55 county gameplay 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 no pc 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.720
 is not that the game where well voice after 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.879
 wake up from a nine-year coma 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920
 He has to leave the hospital that is 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 being attacked by several soldiers with the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.150
 help of a mysterious masked man 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.280
 in fact the guy who makes the voice of this guy 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.199
 masked is nothing less than the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 jack bauer who comes saint remembers that he is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.390
 in the bank the character and use in you 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.830
 who is very weak who imagines 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.110
 You've been in bed for nine years. 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.630
 so if you can not use your legs 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 rights of children are and in this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.650
 situation that is at the time you have 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 to escape from the hospital are already there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.710
 negative climate and speaking in dubbing and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 remember that the previous package I commented 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.680
 that doubles torture we can not always 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 to retain 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.890
 You remember that I commented that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.070
 I would not formally remember that people 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 they would not last longer 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.160
 anyway it's not ricardo gomes nor a game anymore 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.020
 Then I say he tried to explain what he 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.400
 said that only one other person is not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 the crisis even if we do not know 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 would make double the right sense 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.730
 continue to dribble the character that 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.110
 indeed did what would be a resumption of the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.030
 franchise for life in all 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.920
 directions to the unit are promising 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.900

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 going to be an open world will have several 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.260
 options to complete the mission by 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.230
 example I do not know if video games 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.570

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.470
 electronic arts will not be employed in the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.570
