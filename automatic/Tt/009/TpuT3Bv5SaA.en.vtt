will point out that the focus is
slightly<00:00:12.870> off<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.469> fortunately

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
slightly off on this and fortunately

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.730 
slightly off on this and fortunately
sites<00:00:14.599> there<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.690> more<00:00:15.869> clarity<00:00:16.410> there<00:00:16.590> and

going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.360> another<00:00:36.570> five<00:00:36.930> years<00:00:37.320> for

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
going to take another five years for

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.580 
going to take another five years for
that<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.710> happen<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:39.060> the<00:00:39.180> meantime<00:00:39.590> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that to happen but in the meantime this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
that to happen but in the meantime this
is<00:00:40.710> looking<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.130> far

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
is looking good so far

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.540 
is looking good so far
now<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.150> can<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.720> this<00:00:42.900> is<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.550> exact

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
now you can see here this is the exact

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
now you can see here this is the exact
port<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.780> console<00:00:46.110> version<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
port of the console version I have to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.990 
port of the console version I have to
say<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> obviously<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.850> reduced

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
say that obviously they have reduced

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
say that obviously they have reduced
some<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.420> graphical<00:00:48.870> details<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> spot

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
some of the graphical details the spot

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.620 
some of the graphical details the spot
effects<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.310> on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> whole<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.450> there

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
effects but on the whole it's all there

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.620 
effects but on the whole it's all there
and<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.140> near<00:00:52.680> identical<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.790> I<00:00:53.880> say<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
and it's near identical so as I say the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.210 
and it's near identical so as I say the
picture<00:00:54.930> quality<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.470> an<00:00:55.590> awful<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:55.980> better

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
picture quality is an awful lot better

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.100 
picture quality is an awful lot better

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
and Vita owners will know obviously just

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.650 
and Vita owners will know obviously just

which would probably be up in a couple
of<00:02:17.710> weeks<00:02:17.860> time<00:02:18.190> something<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.940> so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
of weeks time something like that so
