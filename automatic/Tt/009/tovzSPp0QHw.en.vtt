00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.130 

here's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> best<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.390> way<00:00:30.449> I've<00:00:30.900> ever

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here's the best of me this way I've ever

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
here's the best of me this way I've ever
found<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.560> try<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> pop-up<00:00:32.040> I'll<00:00:32.550> take<00:00:32.700> six

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
found to try on a pop-up I'll take six

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.770 
found to try on a pop-up I'll take six
inches<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> dental<00:00:33.630> floss<00:00:34.370> fold<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.520> half

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
inches of dental floss fold it in half

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
inches of dental floss fold it in half
and<00:00:36.890> tie<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.160> overhand<00:00:38.250> loop<00:00:39.680> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.890> slip

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and tie an overhand loop it's a slip

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.160 
and tie an overhand loop it's a slip
knot<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.820> will<00:00:42.000> slip<00:00:42.180> down<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> put

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
knot so it will slip down when you put

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.450 
knot so it will slip down when you put
on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> tag<00:00:43.559> ins<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> approximately<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> size

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
on the tag ins so approximately the size

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.549 
on the tag ins so approximately the size
of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> bait<00:00:48.230> i'm<00:00:49.230> using<00:00:49.500> 14<00:00:49.890> minutes<00:00:50.190> here

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
of the bait i'm using 14 minutes here

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
of the bait i'm using 14 minutes here
i'll<00:00:52.559> put<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> boat<00:00:52.980> through<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.910> loop<00:00:54.120> get

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
i'll put the boat through the loop get

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.569 
i'll put the boat through the loop get
it<00:00:55.199> roughly<00:00:55.440> central

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.380 

and<00:01:02.120> then<00:01:02.269> pull<00:01:02.449> down<00:01:02.629> on<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:02.780> two<00:01:03.019> taggings<00:01:03.440> i

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
and then pull down on the two taggings i

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.749 
and then pull down on the two taggings i
lo<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.570> not<00:01:05.750> slips<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:07.250> doesn't<00:01:07.610> slip

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
lo that not slips it doesn't slip

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.380 
lo that not slips it doesn't slip
backwards<00:01:08.920> pull<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.040> nice<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.430> tight<00:01:10.610> and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
backwards pull that nice and tight and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.170 
backwards pull that nice and tight and
then<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.720> simply<00:01:12.080> take<00:01:12.290> one<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.790> tag<00:01:13.970> ins

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
then I simply take one of the tag ins

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.140 
then I simply take one of the tag ins
pop<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.080> through<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.350> rig<00:01:15.500> wing

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.420 

put<00:01:19.780> them<00:01:19.900> up<00:01:19.960> tight<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:20.650> tie<00:01:20.860> exactly

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
put them up tight and then tie exactly

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.070 
put them up tight and then tie exactly
the<00:01:21.580> same<00:01:21.760> not<00:01:22.000> again<00:01:22.270> with<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.690> tag<00:01:22.900> ends

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the same not again with the tag ends

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.140 
the same not again with the tag ends
single<00:01:23.830> overhand<00:01:24.160> knot

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.030 

pull<00:01:31.720> down<00:01:31.870> on<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.080> two<00:01:32.290> tigers<00:01:32.500> again

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.820 

and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:37.760> trim<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.150> off<00:01:38.240> live<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.750> about<00:01:39.470> two

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
and then trim it off live in about two

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.290 
and then trim it off live in about two
or<00:01:39.980> three<00:01:40.130> millimeters<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.910> blob<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.210> a
