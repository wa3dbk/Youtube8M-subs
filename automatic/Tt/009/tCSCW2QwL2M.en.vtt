 To introduce a company that has a proven track record 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.630

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:02.660

 I had made of on the really a lot of company of the company so far it is that kind of work 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.740

 It is actually that the customer Well I visited the company in the facility pretend of the customer Come talk about that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 -2 when it was time to ask questions or ask questions 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.240
 I get noodles and I get a quote afterward. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.850
 We have investigated specifically in that way 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:41.689
 But today taking advantage of the so kind of experience I think you find it to talk 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:46.340
 Most of the people here are Tatezawa . We will consider large-scale remodeling from now on. 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.930
 Or I think that only customers who are in a situation that I am currently thinking about 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 Also from now 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.840
 What about here ? 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.570
 I am not thinking things like a feeling 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.870
 Maybe not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.390
 Usually, if your family's plan for renovation goes up 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.840
 Well 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.720
 Trying to do such alternatives How many minutes 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 The beginning will start from such a place 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.770
 It is a magazine Toka also whether a'll was in that or let's examine in Aso was a little case 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 It's about the entire opinion reform, but it's such a dark gap 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:30.540
 It will take you how much is a good-consuming to know was I So my 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 The size After all, even the form of that your house Te I said do you flows to feel like say my house is 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.660
 It is also the location condition 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.660
 In addition, because it is a flower bead that the family 's way of thinking and basket requests and contents stand 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.610
 And because everyone in Sonia is different in the form of happiness, the amount is the content that suits you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.610
 Or want to know that Tteyuu How much was the one 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:03:10.069
 I asked Booby to get stuck and there might be a little guy I think it would be a bit of a day 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:14.150
 In the title, such as say it does not fail remodeling company to choose large-scale renovation unique 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:21.319
 I think I would like to talk a little 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.340
 Well I am a first long time ago I went to a variety hear in my actual customers to talk to various customers 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.750
 Though 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.810
 It is most of it is 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.380
 When thinking about the scale of renovation 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.140
 I do not want to fail rather than want to succeed 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:40.300
 It was almost like I said that I do not want the Diet 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.690
 Just go to protect the way of Tteyuu the Toka of course still to take a lot of money that hundreds of thousand yen 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:49.540
 Because there are many cases where it costs over 10 million yen 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.870
 In addition, it is a life afterward, so it is said that things that affect the family environment etc. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.250
 Often 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.250
 Well that kind of 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.849
 Of the large scale method 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.910
 Attached to things like Tteyuu eat not to fail 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:11.230
 The Masu enemies become very difficult story because what to do to Tteyuu metabolism Rabbi 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:16.180
 Tea The first thing to say Yes Four Mutte to do so in order to do Arafo not fail 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:22.930
 And a 5th kilometer is often generally referred to as innovation, but also a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.900
 Although it was 6 times in the order from each of our know the difference enough picture book Fair on the act 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.440
 so 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:32.810
 The Kedomo I will from now on also to talk later of Tteyuu One 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.419
 The original formal implications of Tteyuu say you and re-form in Iaido is that the original form 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:40.950
 With the fact that it is regenerated 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:45.150
 Is the original meaning is that to favor with the added value of Tteyuu Reno Beshon 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.500
 That's right, so it's often said that renovations are a big renovation 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:54.330
 Also it is actually want to wait, for example, whether laid the added value of say innovation by mistake 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.350
 Even if you put a stupid chain in place, it would be like an innovation, as if it were double-haired 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.350
 Say it seemed 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.040
 Right 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.340
 a building 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.610
 The necessary know-how for the large-scale reform covered in the 95 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.979
 The fact Tteyuu is 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:16.639
 A lot more of that course of Japanese and large have home difference even for your Buyer sama 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:22.900
 But especially relevant to the owner 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.900
 I picked up five things that I think are not particularly important.
