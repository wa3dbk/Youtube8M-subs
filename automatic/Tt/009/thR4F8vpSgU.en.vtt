What is up guys? Fated here and welcome
back to my channel for another video!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.910
Today I've got the new Lenovo Y50
with a GTX 960M. A lot of things have

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.910
changed since I was last with the Y50
including a new screen and a new GPU.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.130
I wanted to show you guys its new level of
performance on Battlefield 4.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.670
Now I've also done battlefield hardline
but if you have not upgraded yet, go ahead and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.259
stick around and watch battlefield 4
video. If you do choose to ever go to

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.290
hardline go ahead and check that video out. But I will tell you they have very

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.780
similar engines so you are probably gonna see about the same performance level.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.000
Now one thing to note is you do see shadowplay up at the top left. I'm not using shadowplay to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.899
 record this I am actually recording

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.600
externally at 30 fps and using shadowplay just as a frame counter.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.870
Doing it this way enables me to be able
to show you the frame

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010
count without having to reduce any kind of performance

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.399
recording with the PC. By recording
externally I get the maximum

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.820
performance from the PC and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.890
just record externally with another PC.
So at Ultra settings you can see

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.200
that it stays well above 30 FPS except
in those certain instances like here when

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.670
I'm fighting in this tank.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.900
There is a lot of explosions going off, grenades are going off, tank bullets exploding.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.610
It does the below to around 28-27
sometimes, so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630
I would actually consider dropping it
down to high that will get you into a more

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.680
playable range.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.810
At high settings it stays well above
30 fps and it's definitely playable but

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.689
it's not quite that sixty. You can see it
hovers around

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.090
58-56 sometimes. That's not
quite 60 which most monitors nowadays are

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.710
capable 60fps.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.650
Including this Laptop's monitor. I
would actually strive to try to get

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.070
around

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.970
sixty or higher. High settings doesn't
really cut it for me but you do have to

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.040
keep in mind that this is a very large
map,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.650
it's a 64 slot server, there's a lot of
stuff going on, its conquest so there's

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.800
lotsa planes and helicopters and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.380
tanks and all that stuff. Do keep that
in mind if you are on a team death match

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
game on a smaller map you will get a lot
more frames so high actually might be a good

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.560
setting for you, maybe even

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.190
somewhere in between high and ULTRA.
If you do choose to drop it to medium

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.680
settings, you can see it stays well above 60FPS, 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.979
and only drops below in certain
instances and it's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.610
very much playable. It's very fluid, you don't have to worry about any kind of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.340
issues with losing FPS and dipping out
or changing your competitive

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.450
advantage. It's gonna be

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.209
solid and just smooth gameplay. Though
because many have asked me before in the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.800
past

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.930
what low settings actually does, I went
ahead and dropped it down to low

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.010
settings so I can show you guys its level

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.510
performance at low settings. It's
well above 60 sometimes in the 80 range

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.250
its not quite what I thought it
should be so actually my favorite is medium.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.390
I would actually go back to medium
because it's well above 60, its what most

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.660
monitors are going to be doing.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.459
I wouldn't sacrifice any kind of frames
just for the fact that we can get this

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.840
performance right here at 60fps.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.660
Anything over that is going to cause
tearing and stuff like that and you're

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.280
just wasting frames because your monitor
can't even handle it.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.930
So medium is my favorite and that's what
I would use

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.019
or somewhere between medium and high
depending on what kinda game type you're

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:00.480
using.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.540
So that's GTX 960M and once again this is
the exact performance of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.769
what you would get if you were
playing on this PC. Anyways guys thank

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.799

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:22.639
