00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
when I was cuffing it it became silver

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.560 
when I was cuffing it it became silver
metal<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:27.530> better<00:02:28.100> for<00:02:28.220> detailing<00:02:28.790> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
metal so that's better for detailing so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.780 
metal so that's better for detailing so
I<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.780> lucky<00:02:30.049> on<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.799> was<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.160> very<00:02:31.459> very

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
apart when the plastic was hot enough I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.729 
apart when the plastic was hot enough I
had<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.600> push<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.430> waited<00:04:18.430> waited<00:04:19.269> for<00:04:19.690> for<00:04:20.680> it
