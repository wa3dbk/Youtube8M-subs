 my home is my castle and really home 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.250
 This is the place where we can and should 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 feel safe 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.439
 siliceous granite is a material designed and and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.210
 Russian inventors practitioners with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 considering the climatic conditions 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.010
 given the steady growth of utilities 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.720
 payments and our long winters this 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
 material will significantly save 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.090
 on heating 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.350
 besides in 2013 according to the results 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.780
 expertise of silica granite production 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 of the Krasnoyarsk crimea granite crime company 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 in the list of 100 best products of Russia on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.559
 in the west of our country, siliceous granite 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.539
 quite common and many have chosen 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.960
 this material is for building your 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.789
 houses 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 Red On Cyc Innovate Bye 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 are looking at but those who stopped their 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 the choice on granite cream ended up 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.760
 in the black, because the house has an area of ​​100 square 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.039
 meters can be built at the price of dormitory 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.159
 Now the market has established some 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.689
 the average price of building a house with us 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.950
 house here in this middle price range 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 It is not cheap but inexpensive, but the whole thing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.409
 how you will be his 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 to exploit 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.210
 let's assume the repair is not through 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 a year not in two not in 50 years you do not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.119
 it will take 1 to drown our house since 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.520
 it is very warm, you can only once 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.619
 three days with frost minus 40 degrees 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.869
 outside the window 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.420
 in the winter heat plus savings on heating 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.329
 cool in summer without air conditioning 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 the same blocks do not absorb water therefore 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.590
 mold and fungus 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 you are not neighbors is not a house but a dream for everything 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.750
 other silica granite also ecologically 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 safe material two years ago to us 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.320
 has come 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.759
 what Krasnoyarsk region of the teeth anyone 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 Arkadievich who was looking for material for 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.390
 houses 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.370
 he stopped on the material siliceous granite 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.229
 because he 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.680
 fully eco-friendly components 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 used lining is very finished 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.980
 great advantage 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
 he liked everything accept granite 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.910
 blocks have a number of significant advantages 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.050
 in comparison with other construction 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.940
 materials 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.830

 because insulation is already included 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.970
 such blocks to the same cream granite 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130
 the unit is completely finished wall element and 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.550
 does not need warming and facing 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.560
 so it is convenient to build them very quickly 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.240
 wall building blocks do not require 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.670
 facade decoration and the interior 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.880
 surface immediately after laying ready for 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.420
 finish works as soon as you built 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.990
 the house covered the roof you can immediately 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.820
 come do a lot of finishes at home 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.640
 other materials they need let's say 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.400
 stand there for a year or two before 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.710
 start doing finishing in our house so 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.500
 and lures you can for one building 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.630
 season build a house and live in it and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.520
 Of course do not forget about beauty when 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.860
 block production, you can create any 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.209
 glossy to imitation facial texture 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.850
 natural stone 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.310
 as well as any exterior color 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.980
 walls with this product sincerely granite 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.870
 do not fade under the influence of the sun to 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.540
 all of the above should add 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.000
 excellent sound insulation so what is it 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.920
 for the beast is such a siliceous that combines 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.100
 in itself so many positive qualities 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.820
 ask you tell 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.160
 energy saving block represents 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.380
 a multi-layer construction of the front 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.510
 the side of the block is made of material 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.150
 creams that smash and that will determine 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.250
 how your house looks externally namely

 color and texture of the inner layer 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.209
 insulation is usually made of 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.350
 polystyrene foam 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.959
 the inner layer of the block consists of 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.390
 heavy soft clean concrete high 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.870
 quality is the bearing element 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.269
 walls 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.580
 outer and inner layer are connected 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.280
 between them basalt ties 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.890
 with each of the components of the block 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.290
 quite by itself for example 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.110
 concrete masonry from heavy finely 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.609
 cellular concrete of brand m400 which 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.620
 significantly stronger than ordinary brick 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.039
 outer facing sincerely 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.090
 granite is concrete by special technology 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.569
 resembling texture and density 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.650
 frozen silicate glass 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.569
 polystyrene foam is very 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.699
 lightweight insulation offered on 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.280
 world market besides it possesses 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.590
 very low thermal conductivity only 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.599
 imagine your home will serve as well 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.460
 long as a medieval castle to its
