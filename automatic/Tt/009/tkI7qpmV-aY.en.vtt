00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.969
 hello, dear viewers, we are here at 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.079
 a celebration on the cebit and take 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.369
 the alex and david stand us 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.119
 equally new graphics cards 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.560
 Tell alex are blue what I have so far 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.310
 know orange is what can now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 better there we have decided 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.349
 be the color for wakes orange year 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.999
 either tricks or toxic and accurate 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.700
 klaus a bit closer to the 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:36.290
 celebration has always been our color and 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.630
 we have three new models 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 starting at the very front of the picture 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.010
 at the 280 x6 which is always a bit 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.120
 overworked he had one more 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.840
 Solution with two fans and now we have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.970
 Built the tricks cool on it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 the pretty good reviews get 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.690
 on the part of the press why we have 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.160
 let's say we're doing a new design 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 and that's how the card came about 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.300
 until the seamless transition, so to speak 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.940
 the old one will not give it anymore 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.580
 now these can do something about the taktraten 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.580
 tell me yes, it 's going to run 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 gigahertz and with pustules on 1900 and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.740
 the store is with outside 500 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.370
 megahertz clocked and tragic namely 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.910
 real 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.030
 ok and this slightly larger device 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:37.430
 trend what is that this is the new 92 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.620
 wakes has four gigabytes of memory 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.380
 Here are some new things 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.840
 come in for the part 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.370
 including a special cooling for 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.890
 the voltage transformer and that too has 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.830
 a smart fan control because 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.290
 Many testers have said yes in May was 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.920
 which makes us almost a bit loud 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 we worked a bit on it 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 and the whole thing is like that now 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.690
 temperature dependent only one of the three 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.240
 fan works and above a certain 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.790
 temperature keep the other two 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.220
 also under load 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.360
 the proper cooling as usual and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.860
 im idle simply travel the kid up 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.210
 Every case is very good and we are 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.200
 curious how then in the end it 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.870
 So I think we have fails 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.510
 07 son was measured at 360 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.160
 on and if we have two of the three 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.450
 fan is likely in the area 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.450
 demand to be composed and bitter 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.299
 I hope so strong how quickly bitter 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.799
 his 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:51.670
 the 92's is clocked with 1050's 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.080
 of course designed that the 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.610
 the users then a bit 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 can create hand so that will be 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.870
 certainly not the end of the flagpole 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.630
 his 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.360
 Have fun overclocking say so 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.520
 1050 is already quite a bit 190 and it 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.340
 should already in the range 120 iks with yes 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.130
 Being in touch with Cuba is exactly like that 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 someone in benchmarks yes there is still 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.970
 a the turn what's that 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.650
 yes it looks pretty much the same 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:26.019
 but that's the big brother 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.010
 you can almost see it on the back 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.010
 a little the differences 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.370
 not only that the 92 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.920
 minimal more memory has to be exact 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.230
 its double to 48 gb 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.220
 we also have it here in the back 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.140
 can see area 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.760
 the coils are cooled from both sides 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.530
 that's what our black diamond is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.820
 shocks the bilateral the gene 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.540
 which btw by natural 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:05.090
 longer life through higher schools 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.680
 just exactly the map has as well 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.680
 So also the same intelligent 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:17.289
 fan control and a 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:20.109
 temperature display would have to but 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.220
 have one where is in the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.220
 Temperature gauge ask 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.300
 it hides behind the very one 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.039
 free logan 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 So in operation you then show what 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:39.750
 colors that's what it looks like there 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.520
 the logo has three different ones 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.240
 color codes corresponding to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.190
 temperatures so idle green light 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.500
 Last blue full load red namely now 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.620
 Do it in the direction I believe it 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:00.220
 is in the idle almost blue then comes orange 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.940
 and I do not have the last one yet 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.009
 seen that the air is good 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.680
 interesting for people with a housing 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.199
 its window has interesting little ones 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.879
 edge information this this in jobs 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.039
 the cooling that goes through the pcb 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.789
 the camera already from the first two hours 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.889
 77 toxic that's right there exactly 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.550
 we have used there again 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.260
 just noticed that the 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.480
 very effective 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.610
 ok how long is and then we'll see 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.210
 on the last model I'm still there 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.310
 what seen 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.630
 to this computer seems already one 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.160
 to be new 206 what is that exactly 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.190
 yes that's the new one, so to speak 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:50.100
 flagship what to come soon 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:53.410
 The 992 ex toxic is allowed in the reason 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.930
 relatively the same Map of the world war 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.660
 also has eight gigabytes of memory but 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.540
 of course clock a bit higher 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.200
 how high can I still unfortunately 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.520
 Do not tell 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.750
 that was my next question 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.680
 thank you m8, you're crazy 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.850
 interesting you can see here right now 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.710
 that this card really only this 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.480
 a fan in the nel run up 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.840
 what would be the name you have to be 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.790
 that it goes up that unfortunately I can 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.950
 I do not even say I have it myself 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.870
 can not test that is quasi 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.550
 dewy from taiwan arrived 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.600
 then plugged directly into this calculator 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:31.090
 we have to try ourselves first 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.190
 So in any case not not load 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.080
 controlled so 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.670
 it's not about the clock going up 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.690
 but actually goes to the 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.750
 temperature found 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.550
 but where is the exact point because of me 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.560
 just not always okay at least 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.270
 Can you ever see that there is the 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.060
 temperature display the hello blue 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.830
 that means you do not shine a load completely 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.410
 just right so that will be on 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.310
 change every case 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.310
 we can also show it off 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.340
 Thanks a lot for the information 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.300
 The climate has very exciting lineup 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.300
 very nice that you are with us
