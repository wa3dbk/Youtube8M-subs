00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.590
 hi techno friends and how are i 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.600
 I'm brother Manuel I won him in the networks 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.340
 social and today we're going to see a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.910
 very interesting tutorial that I have 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.209
 requested the boys through the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.520
 facebook through the mail and is the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.730
 to be able to configure a tuner 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.470
 digital usb brand k word in the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.120
 windows media center to be able 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.190
 visualize it you should already record in great 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.039
 quality remember that this device 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.469
 is in the market this is very sold 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.910
 but not many know the master suite 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.910
 and even in him 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.920
 let's see how we are going to configure it 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.410
 this is about this device 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.079
 Look, it does not come with all these accessories 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 and we are going to learn how we are going to 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.180
 install in the windows media center 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.090
 first we start our our 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.500
 windows media center and default 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 when are we going to give configure in the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.320
 region does not come out like but here you have to 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.329
 make a change you do not have to leave it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.690
 because this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.909
 to be recognized a change 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 meaningful if they do not choose it 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.950
 abandons selecting channels 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 distinguish them will tune the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 we look for the option of taiwan 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 here in the example the zip code for 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.789
 the following we accept the terms 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.240
 later it's going to be a test going to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.479
 Download configuration data 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.979
 we wait a moment does not take long 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.590
 once downloaded all three 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.759
 satellite cable options and antenna what 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 we are interested in these 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.360
 dispositives 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.490
 without grace 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.190
 now we have to configure other signals 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.220
 it should be if we give it set 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.200
 set the analog signal but 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.890
 we would content ourselves in this 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 scarce foundation 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 and here it gives us the kind of look for 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.140
 search programs to download the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.900
 Complete guide to do it very well 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:55.160
 doing the search of the channels that 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:55.160
 they are active global america 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.600
 we wait a little bit so we're going to 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.600
 wait 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.070
 have detected some channels 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.580
 and this ended and he found until the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.580
 11 channels moment 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.270
 compared 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.270
 let's give him the following 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.720
 and we give you finalize these 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.450
 teachers 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.500
 and let's give it 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680
 beautiful 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.930
 m 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.810
 well that has been together we must 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.550
 interesting 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.410
 take care if we already sell as 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.410
 tutorials to help you 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.379
 or if not writing
