it<00:04:46.849> was<00:04:47.000> definitely<00:04:47.120> best<00:04:47.479> field<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:47.810> me<00:04:47.900> to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
it was definitely best field for me to

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.740 
it was definitely best field for me to
go<00:04:48.050> into<00:04:48.430> there's<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.699> lot<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.120> opportunities

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
go into there's a lot of opportunities

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.730 
go into there's a lot of opportunities
there's<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.110> lot<00:04:51.259> of<00:04:51.349> jobs<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:52.129> graduated<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.360> a

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
there's a lot of jobs I graduated on a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.990 
there's a lot of jobs I graduated on a
thing<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.889> Friday<00:04:55.159> and<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.460> already<00:04:55.580> had<00:04:55.789> a<00:04:55.819> lot

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
thing of Friday and I already had a lot

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.279 
thing of Friday and I already had a lot
of<00:04:56.180> job<00:04:56.360> lined<00:04:56.599> up<00:04:56.720> for<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.990> Wednesday<00:04:57.259> before

there's<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.389> lot<00:04:59.569> of<00:04:59.659> interesting<00:05:00.080> work<00:05:00.259> that

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
there's a lot of interesting work that

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.740 
there's a lot of interesting work that
can<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.620> done<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.099> try<00:05:01.909> not<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.120> judge<00:05:02.389> what

the<00:05:03.680> discipline<00:05:04.039> of<00:05:04.129> Electrical<00:05:04.520> Engineering

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
the discipline of Electrical Engineering

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.040 
the discipline of Electrical Engineering
is<00:05:04.970> based<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.360> your<00:05:05.449> first<00:05:05.659> year<00:05:05.720> courses

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
is based on your first year courses

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.379 
is based on your first year courses
because<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:07.220> things<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.550> did<00:05:07.699> in<00:05:07.879> circuits<00:05:08.270> are

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
because the things I did in circuits are

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.520 
because the things I did in circuits are
totally<00:05:08.690> different<00:05:08.840> from<00:05:09.110> what<00:05:09.199> I'm<00:05:09.289> doing

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
totally different from what I'm doing

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.110 
totally different from what I'm doing
now<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:09.860> even<00:05:10.340> if<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.490> don't<00:05:10.669> like<00:05:10.819> what<00:05:11.000> your
