00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
mean I mean I think I think I portion we
have<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.140> quite<00:01:19.350> fortunate<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.140> have

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
have been quite fortunate that we have

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.030 
have been quite fortunate that we have
been<00:01:22.920> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.759> realize<00:01:24.060> fewer<00:01:25.040> like

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
been able to actually realize fewer like

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
been able to actually realize fewer like
relatively<00:01:26.430> large<00:01:26.610> projects<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> very

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
relatively large projects at a very

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
relatively large projects at a very
stage<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> main<00:01:29.280> blessing<00:01:29.759> was<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
stage I think the main blessing was the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
stage I think the main blessing was the
term<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.600> essentially<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:31.740> parents<00:01:32.189> didn't

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
term that essentially my parents didn't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.980 
term that essentially my parents didn't
have<00:01:32.549> any<00:01:32.759> friends<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.329> needed<00:01:33.750> summer

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
have any friends that needed summer

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
have any friends that needed summer

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
houses when I graduated so and I think

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
houses when I graduated so and I think
when<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> holes<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
when you when you get into that holes of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
when you when you get into that holes of
Faustian<00:01:39.210> deal<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.810> doing<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.340> relatives

his first lecture a great honor for us

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.840 
his first lecture a great honor for us
after<00:04:48.390> 20<00:04:48.870> years<00:04:49.050> outside<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.920> Europe<00:04:50.640> he

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
after 20 years outside of Europe he

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.270 
after 20 years outside of Europe he
didn't<00:04:51.060> nature<00:04:51.330> for<00:04:51.840> 20<00:04:52.140> years<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.410> Europe<00:04:52.500> the

Grand<00:04:53.580> Master<00:04:53.730> of<00:04:53.940> organic<00:04:54.420> design<00:04:54.690> which

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
Grand Master of organic design which

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.560 
Grand Master of organic design which
Kalani<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.560> he<00:04:56.250> told<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.640> very<00:04:56.940> simply

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
Kalani and he told this very simply

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.300 
Kalani and he told this very simply
doesn't<00:04:57.840> use<00:04:58.050> computers<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.770> or<00:04:59.100> any

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
doesn't use computers or or any

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.220 
doesn't use computers or or any
animation<00:04:59.790> so<00:04:59.940> I<00:04:59.970> think<00:05:00.240> he<00:05:00.540> was<00:05:00.660> using<00:05:00.870> just

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
animation so I think he was using just

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.950 
animation so I think he was using just
big<00:05:01.940> penciling<00:05:02.940> was<00:05:03.120> drawing<00:05:03.390> these<00:05:03.540> projects

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
big penciling was drawing these projects

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.590 
big penciling was drawing these projects
amazing<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.590> he<00:05:05.130> draw<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.790> city<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.360> he<00:05:06.540> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
amazing and he draw a city that he is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.780 
amazing and he draw a city that he is
developing<00:05:06.870> next<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.500> some<00:05:08.160> guy<00:05:08.190> i<00:05:08.370> believe

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
developing next to some guy i believe

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.370 
developing next to some guy i believe
for<00:05:09.120> as<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.360> beijing<00:05:09.720> i<00:05:09.840> don't<00:05:09.960> know<00:05:10.020> maybe<00:05:10.200> you

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
for as a beijing i don't know maybe you

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.810 
for as a beijing i don't know maybe you
know<00:05:10.500> which<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.830> completely<00:05:11.250> self-sufficient

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
know which is completely self-sufficient

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.570 
know which is completely self-sufficient
and<00:05:12.300> exactly<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> way<00:05:13.560> how<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:13.800> described<00:05:14.430> as

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
and exactly the way how you described as

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.760 
and exactly the way how you described as
a<00:05:14.610> vision<00:05:14.970> i<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.930> no<00:05:16.050> idea<00:05:16.140> what's<00:05:16.440> happening

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
a vision i have no idea what's happening

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.070 
a vision i have no idea what's happening
to<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:16.980> to<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.310> to<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.880> finishing<00:05:18.390> of<00:05:18.900> it

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
to the to the to the finishing of it

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.960 
to the to the to the finishing of it
obviously<00:05:20.010> nothing<00:05:20.160> because<00:05:20.670> we<00:05:20.790> haven't

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
obviously nothing because we haven't

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.790 
obviously nothing because we haven't
really<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.780> was<00:05:21.930> five<00:05:22.140> years<00:05:22.170> ago<00:05:22.440> but

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
really that that was five years ago but

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.700 
really that that was five years ago but
how<00:05:23.340> close<00:05:23.730> are<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.570> with<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.930> supersonic

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
how close are you with the supersonic

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.560 
how close are you with the supersonic
project<00:05:26.010> i<00:05:26.100> mean<00:05:26.220> what<00:05:26.790> are<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.000> stories<00:05:27.330> over

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
project i mean what are the stories over

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.420 
project i mean what are the stories over
there<00:05:27.720> i'm<00:05:28.110> at<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.440> background<00:05:28.620> starts<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.310> be

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
there i'm at the background starts to be

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.970 
there i'm at the background starts to be
so<00:05:29.640> completely<00:05:30.480> realistic<00:05:31.290> about<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:31.950> I

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
so completely realistic about it that I

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.400 
so completely realistic about it that I
mean<00:05:32.450> one<00:05:33.450> of<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.570> main<00:05:33.720> challenges<00:05:33.750> of

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
mean one of the main challenges of

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.710 
mean one of the main challenges of
sustainability<00:05:35.160> is<00:05:35.340> like<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:36.150> possibility

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
sustainability is like the possibility

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.020 
sustainability is like the possibility
of<00:05:36.780> holistic<00:05:37.230> thinking<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.520> planning<00:05:38.730> and

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
of holistic thinking and planning and

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.370 
of holistic thinking and planning and
that's<00:05:39.150> why<00:05:39.270> large<00:05:39.480> scale<00:05:39.810> projects<00:05:40.230> actually

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
that's why large scale projects actually

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.080 
that's why large scale projects actually
have<00:05:40.650> major<00:05:41.190> potential<00:05:41.580> because<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:41.940> don't

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
have major potential because you don't

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.910 
have major potential because you don't
have<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.300> plug<00:05:42.510> your<00:05:43.020> little<00:05:43.320> building<00:05:43.620> into

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
have to plug your little building into

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.590 
have to plug your little building into
an<00:05:44.130> unsustainable<00:05:44.850> infrastructure<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.450> can

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
an unsustainable infrastructure you can
