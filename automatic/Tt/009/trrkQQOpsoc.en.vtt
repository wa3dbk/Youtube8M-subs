 did you have this situation when 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.140

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.360

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.050
 chords are you trying to pick first 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 chord maybe tonic chord you 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.070
 it turns out to pick up but difficult 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.289
 some complicated sequence either 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.420
 you don't know how to do it well you 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.640
 try to go online but chords 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.680
 either not yet or not at all 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.289
 very popular and they may appear 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.679
 quite in this case you need to pick up 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.310
 chords yourself and in this game you 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.869
 learn to pick them up by ear and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.849
 sometimes you will get it 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.990
 make even without tools even without 

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:23.360
 guitar or piano 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.390
 you can just hear the song right there 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.750
 record her chords either play immediately 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.399
 them if you have a tool in your hands 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.830
 let's see how to play this game 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.319
 the first thing to do is click on 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.679
 button of what frequently asked questions and 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.240
 carefully read the information for 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.640
 located here with these 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 here are the arrows you can move it 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.050
 up or down here contains very 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.539
 important recommendations that will help you 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.270
 get the most out of this game 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.709
 Next, press the back button and go 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.950
 the training mode is loading enveloping and 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.950
 now 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.310
 now we heard three chords which 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.050
 tuned our ears to this key 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.520
 it sounded the first chord 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:15.460
 it was a tonic chord first chord 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 our tonality tonic then sounded 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.340
 4 4 subdominant level and then 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 dominated these chords 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.910
 set our ears to this 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.710
 key to start 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.130
 music plays and we could 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.820
 guess chords click on these 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.620
 columns we just need to click on 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.620
 screen and carefully listen further 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.420
 when the chord sounds in the column 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.430
 we need to pick it up first 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.410
 level I allowed it until I know 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.140
 miss it again feathers 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:02.490
 and you already guessed the manager to pick but here 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.490
 is it to me somehow the fourth step 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.560
 reliably 4 again I guessed chords 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:32.980
 the next legs start to sound 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:36.820
 the first is 5 4 1 they write to me that I 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.280
 handled it and I have a choice I 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.260
 can continue and if i am not well 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.299
 played and not very well defining the Kurds 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.360
 I can again enter training mode if 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.560
 I guess they are unmistakably worth me 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.750
 press the play button 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 and go to the more complex version 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.769
 this game where i will be ticking 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.660
 me for a certain amount of time and 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.720
 for the minimum number of attempts needed 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.130
 will guess all the chords 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.470
 here you can set the level but 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.269
 if you are a beginner better pass all 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.440
 levels last sequentially with 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.100
 first to the highest in this 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.630
 I didn't change anything 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.340
 in them it is possible in general if you are very 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.530
 ok hear the chords can it 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.350
 translate further if you have full 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.210
 access either leave at first and press 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.390
 play button let's do it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:32.090
 note that most often the first 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.890
 chord that sounds to our game when 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.100
 determining it will be a tonic of this 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:42.320
 maybe it will help determine and so 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.230
 Press the play button again settings 1 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.350
 4 5 and after we press the button 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.960
 see i have 40 seconds and i need 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.550
 it will be quick enough 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.880
 chords 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:04.700
 this is the first first step only to me 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:06.500
 it seems 4 is the fifth word 5 now i'm 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.660
 The third fourth was wrong. They tell me not. 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.000
 sick low niqab city again not that 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:24.340
 here i got here say try 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:37.790
 still this first 10 seconds left 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:40.670
 if the situation is rarely time is at zero 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.620
 that is almost second to second i 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.210
 managed to get out of this situation you 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.040
 see that if you once 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.740
 miss something you already have enough 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.550
 difficult to win therefore 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.260
 try to undergo maximum training 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.850
 it is in training mode that they are in mode 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.910
 games because in the game mode you already need 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.310
 unmistakably guess the chords further 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.330
 I click on the continue button and since I 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.640
 already completed level 1 1 in training mode 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.500
 In the game mode, the program itself to me 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.360
 recommends already playing at level two 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.689
 I can choose to play at my level 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.369
 learning to 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.529
 first get comfortable in these 

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:19.839
 sequence or go directly 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.469
 to the game mode if i am very good 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:25.629
 I guess chords and immediately unmistakably 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.669
 choose those that are needed for this all I 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.319
 I remind you that if you want straight 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.869
