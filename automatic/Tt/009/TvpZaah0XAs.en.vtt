00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.689 
edges to be blended out and i wanted to
say<00:04:18.209> clean<00:04:18.599> brush<00:04:19.079> but<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:20.159> not<00:04:20.370> fair

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
say clean brush but that's not fair

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.490 
say clean brush but that's not fair
because<00:04:20.820> i<00:04:21.000> use<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.479> brush<00:04:21.690> on<00:04:21.989> my<00:04:22.199> other<00:04:22.409> eye

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500

because i use this brush on my other eye
as<00:04:22.680> well<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.820> that's<00:04:23.970> why<00:04:24.210> it's<00:04:24.240> not<00:04:24.449> clean<00:04:24.900> but

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
as well so that's why it's not clean but

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.850
