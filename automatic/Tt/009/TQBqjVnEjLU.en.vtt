00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
entertainment Kelly a ugly sub cut the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.070 
entertainment Kelly a ugly sub cut the
hair<00:03:47.830> but<00:03:48.790> there<00:03:48.940> are<00:03:49.030> limits<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.660> also

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
hair but there are limits to it also

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.010 
hair but there are limits to it also
but<00:03:50.860> those<00:03:51.070> limits<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.580> think<00:03:51.970> when<00:03:52.540> their<00:03:52.750> time

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020

has<00:04:03.850> limitations<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.840> as<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.320> little<00:04:05.740> bit

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860
