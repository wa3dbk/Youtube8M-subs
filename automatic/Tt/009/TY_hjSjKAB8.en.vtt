00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.520 
that these players in the team of
Caesars<00:02:27.030> will<00:02:27.239> be<00:02:27.360> pink<00:02:27.629> again<00:02:28.050> there<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.349> not

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
Caesars will be pink again there is not

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.900 
Caesars will be pink again there is not
one<00:02:28.680> hundred<00:02:28.920> percent<00:02:29.099> confirmed<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:29.849> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
one hundred percent confirmed but I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
one hundred percent confirmed but I
think<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.360> product<00:02:30.660> leading<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.319> I

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
think this is product leading to it as I

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.930 
think this is product leading to it as I
think<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:31.980> pretty<00:02:32.069> good<00:02:32.250> evidence<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.790> well

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
think it's pretty good evidence as well

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.610 
think it's pretty good evidence as well
given<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.269> factory<00:02:33.599> at<00:02:33.989> pink<00:02:34.230> cards<00:02:34.440> are

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
given the factory at pink cards are

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.589 
given the factory at pink cards are
coming<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.209> ties<00:02:36.330> into<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
coming and it kind of ties into the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.300 
coming and it kind of ties into the
stuff<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.959> out<00:02:37.140> next<00:02:37.290> week<00:02:37.560> these<00:02:37.980> next<00:02:38.250> two
