circles around that big center dot they

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.080 
circles around that big center dot they
don't<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.900> any<00:01:34.170> particular<00:01:34.530> size<00:01:35.090> in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
don't have to be any particular size in

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
don't have to be any particular size in
fact<00:01:36.570> i<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> cute<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.890> when

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
fact i think it's kind of cute or when

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.289 
fact i think it's kind of cute or when
there<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.000> vary<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.390> size<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> i'm<00:01:45.240> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
there when they vary in size so i'm just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.580 
there when they vary in size so i'm just
going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.380> around<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.360> as

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to go all the way around and as

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to go all the way around and as
many<00:01:49.640> times<00:01:50.640> around<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:51.180> required<00:01:51.630> try<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
many times around as required try and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
many times around as required try and
keep<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> dots<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> smaller<00:01:53.850> size<00:01:54.180> i

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
keep the dots on the smaller size i

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
keep the dots on the smaller size i
think<00:01:54.659> when<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.110> bigger<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.740> starts<00:01:56.220> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
think when they get bigger it starts to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
think when they get bigger it starts to
get<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.810> sort<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> chunky<00:01:58.439> looking<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
get a little sort of chunky looking and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.330 
get a little sort of chunky looking and
this<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.750> design<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.170> more<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.799> a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
this is really this design is more of a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.530 
this is really this design is more of a
