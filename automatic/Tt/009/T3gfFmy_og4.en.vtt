but like I said it's never gonna stop me
the<00:01:02.789> technical<00:01:03.329> term<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.840> fecal<00:01:04.379> energy

excretion<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.850> I've<00:01:06.000> changed<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.750> little

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
excretion but I've changed that a little

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.529 
excretion but I've changed that a little
bit<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.410> I'm<00:01:07.530> calling<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.369> fiber<00:01:09.030> flush

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
bit and I'm calling it the fiber flush

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.219 
bit and I'm calling it the fiber flush
effect<00:01:10.140> studies<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.310> shown<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.869> each

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
effect studies have shown that with each

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.800 
effect studies have shown that with each
gram<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> fiber<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.810> excrete<00:01:16.320> calories

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
gram of fiber you excrete calories

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
gram of fiber you excrete calories
clinical<00:01:18.810> studies<00:01:19.200> vary<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.830> 3<00:01:20.040> calories<00:01:20.700> up

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
clinical studies vary from 3 calories up

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
clinical studies vary from 3 calories up
to<00:01:21.479> 12<00:01:21.780> calories<00:01:22.080> however<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.640> average

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to 12 calories however if you average

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
to 12 calories however if you average
the<00:01:24.299> studies<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.799> excrete<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.820> 7

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the studies out you excrete about 7

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
the studies out you excrete about 7
calories<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.710> every<00:01:29.310> gram<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.210> fiber<00:01:31.549> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
calories for every gram of fiber this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.700 
calories for every gram of fiber this
means<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.470> consumed<00:01:36.110> 35<00:01:37.110> grams<00:01:37.439> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
means if you just consumed 35 grams of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.969 
means if you just consumed 35 grams of
fiber<00:01:37.950> daily<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.409> eliminate

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
fiber daily you would actually eliminate

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
fiber daily you would actually eliminate
245<00:01:43.979> calories<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.820> stool<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> that's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
245 calories in your stool and that's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
245 calories in your stool and that's
with<00:01:46.350> no<00:01:46.700> exercise<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:48.619> call<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.369> fiber

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
with no exercise I call this the fiber

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
with no exercise I call this the fiber
flush<00:01:51.930> formula<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:53.939> call<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.110> biggest

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
flush formula I also call it the biggest

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.670 
flush formula I also call it the biggest
bonus<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:58.049> fiber<00:01:58.380> 35<00:01:59.340> plan<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.470> only

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bonus of the fiber 35 plan if you only

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.389 
bonus of the fiber 35 plan if you only
get<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.610> thing<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> show<00:02:04.680> today<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
get one thing from this show today I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.800 
get one thing from this show today I
hope<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.380> fiber<00:02:07.710> flush<00:02:08.160> formula<00:02:08.850> let

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
hope it's this fiber flush formula let

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.620 
hope it's this fiber flush formula let
me<00:02:09.959> show<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.320> what<00:02:10.799> this<00:02:10.979> means<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.670> I'm

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
me show you what this means to you I'm

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.100 
me show you what this means to you I'm
going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.650> use<00:02:13.860> an<00:02:13.980> example<00:02:14.579> of<00:02:14.760> Mary<00:02:15.120> Mary

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
going to use an example of Mary Mary

going to use an example of Mary Mary
needs<00:02:16.500> about<00:02:16.879> 1800<00:02:17.879> calories<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.629> day

maintain<00:02:20.230> her<00:02:20.470> current<00:02:20.800> weight<00:02:21.600> let's<00:02:22.600> just

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
maintain her current weight let's just

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.740 
maintain her current weight let's just
look<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:24.070> fiber<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.970> for<00:02:25.240> Mary<00:02:25.480> if

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
look at what fiber can do for Mary if

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.860 
look at what fiber can do for Mary if
Mary<00:02:26.500> consumed<00:02:27.120> 1,800<00:02:28.120> calories<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.840> day

and she regularly ate about 10 grams of
fiber<00:02:31.930> she<00:02:32.920> would<00:02:33.100> fibre<00:02:33.400> flush<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:34.030> about<00:02:34.360> 70

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050
