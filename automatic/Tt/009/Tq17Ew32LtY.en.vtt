garlic and I blend it all together it's
pretty<00:00:51.480> cold<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> touch<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
pretty cold so I don't like to touch it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.639 
pretty cold so I don't like to touch it
as<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.570> green<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
as you can see it's green I put some in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.610 
as you can see it's green I put some in
already<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.969> use<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.899> hair<00:00:58.230> spoon

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
already and I use that my hair spoon

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.410 
already and I use that my hair spoon
because<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.789> cold<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.480> smells<00:01:00.899> really<00:01:01.170> bad<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
because it's cold it smells really bad I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
because it's cold it smells really bad I
guess<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> garlic<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
guess it's because of the garlic but it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.240 
guess it's because of the garlic but it
