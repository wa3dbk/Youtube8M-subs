so<00:00:17.039> given<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.520> broke<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> table

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so given that it broke one of the table

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.000 
so given that it broke one of the table
legs<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> particularly<00:00:19.140> benign<00:00:19.650> endeavor

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
legs on a particularly benign endeavor

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.310 
legs on a particularly benign endeavor
I've<00:00:20.369> since<00:00:20.970> broken<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.420> even<00:00:21.720> more<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.080> order

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I've since broken it even more in order

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
I've since broken it even more in order
to<00:00:22.500> reattach<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> table<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
to reattach it to the table it's a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.179 
to reattach it to the table it's a
little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.840> shorter<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.380> side<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
little bit shorter on that side but it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.870 
little bit shorter on that side but it
should<00:00:26.460> still<00:00:26.699> work<00:00:28.250> getting<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.609> degree

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
should still work getting to some degree

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
should still work getting to some degree
trickier<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.480> days<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> put<00:00:31.230> the

I'm gonna try and grab it and put it
underneath<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> sitting<00:00:37.380> position

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
interestingly enough it looks like the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.490 
interestingly enough it looks like the
tables<00:01:56.220> still<00:01:56.550> intact<00:01:56.910> as<00:01:57.390> our<00:01:58.050> two<00:01:58.260> of<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
tables still intact as our two of the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680 
tables still intact as our two of the
legs<00:01:58.850> however<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.970> same<00:02:00.150> can't<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.420> said<00:02:00.510> for

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
legs however the same can't be said for

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.220 
legs however the same can't be said for
the<00:02:00.870> other<00:02:01.050> two<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.510> don't<00:02:03.510> have<00:02:03.600> any<00:02:03.750> vertebrae
