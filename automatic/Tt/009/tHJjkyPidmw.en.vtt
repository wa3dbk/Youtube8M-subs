00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
let him down when the differential

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.710

that<00:05:15.140> was<00:05:15.260> no<00:05:15.590> Pinos<00:05:16.010> maybe<00:05:16.310> an<00:05:16.430> odd<00:05:16.580> ticking

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
that was no Pinos maybe an odd ticking

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.580 
that was no Pinos maybe an odd ticking
noise<00:05:17.120> but<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.420> you<00:05:17.540> see<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.080> precision<00:05:18.500> has

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
noise but as you see the precision has

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.000 
noise but as you see the precision has
gone

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
gone

he's clipping things but he just hasn't

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.300 
he's clipping things but he just hasn't

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
that I think something was wrong with

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.030 
that I think something was wrong with
his<00:06:04.040> car<00:06:04.250> so<00:06:04.580> he<00:06:05.180> was<00:06:05.360> not<00:06:05.510> really<00:06:06.410> able<00:06:06.740> to

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
his car so he was not really able to

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.520 
his car so he was not really able to
keep<00:06:07.910> it<00:06:08.030> as<00:06:08.180> performance<00:06:08.600> than<00:06:08.900> before<00:06:09.230> so

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
keep it as performance than before so

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.610
