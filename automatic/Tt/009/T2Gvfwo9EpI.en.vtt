00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 mark regev which is very much positive thinking is the best thing in the world for 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.440
 all in all directions is a merchant attitude in the Chinese capital 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.299
 and already comes to the mark that the date of the trial 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.469
 despite the defeat and especially on the street 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.640
 at night is a year ruled by Venus at the time the planet responsible for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 love relationships so it is not too many people say that the projection of 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.320
 like when you like things 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.869
 I went then it's important 2010 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.759
 2010 just this you that dynamic of going after what you 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.960
 likes and does not take the bold attitude of the ballad with the attitude of the athletes with 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.210
 age between 8 and 10 in a certain way the entry of a new year now into the sign 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.270
 of aries that is the great astrological event of this 2010 he grabs 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.590
 just my father's catalyst also this thing of the mass movements 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.139
 I want people on the street people claiming 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.620
 the weight reduction measure as the issue of communication 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.090
 is precisely the access to information and greater access to information 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.490
 here people 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.490
 walking in the platoon has colleagues and the g77 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.340
 this is not a danger to man's survival because the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.229
 would deprive the general assembly at the general assembly in the auditorium that it gathered today with the name 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.310
 from daniel 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.820
 did not expect to see in the structural plane 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.240
 in the cattle auctions in the east the dilma in the garage 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 robert moderation is desired is quite a thing 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 it is easy to get lucky benjamin netanyahu 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.620
 op - you did this is one thing I already hope to give a lot of anxiety generate a 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.950
 I think it's a great possibility yes yes you think I 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 I think so by showing the scenario presented now that your government is more 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 I think the saw has a gun with five shots the boxer today to the lusa 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.190
 source of scientific police 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.430
 with the expiration date of the option 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.570
 no saw 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 this change of course 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.490
 free entrance 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 and the scandals all politicians determines the prohibition of something 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840
 otherwise I think I'm still in Brazil 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.729
 I think mainly this thing of the capital no scenery is thing 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.319
 similar 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.840
 political observations that are still immense, especially in the first 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.909
 semester of 2010 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.649
 already in the second half of the March calculation because we pay closer 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.129
 the elections in the state 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.459
 but of course it will be capitalized for some 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.529
 the old note the other three candidates but I think I continue with 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:34.719
 the main mediator of the table at the outset the question of 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.359
 information through the internet media vehicles and 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.549
 people never updated in normandy
