00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.560
 hey what goes off people heartily 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 Welcome to another video here 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 do people on a canal and today 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.109
 Let's see the next episode of the faq and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.939
 In the background you can see some black 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.289
 ops 2 gameplays that are a bit older 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 but I thought I had to come to you 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 in any case upload again because the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 we have had so many clicks and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.859
 this definitely was life for 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.899
 especially the first gameplay 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.430
 People are one of my favorite nucleus 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.870
 In the middle he does 1 of course plays 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 Hundreds of precise start 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 and yes, I hope I'll be happy to please 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.980
 yes me and me say we start with 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.980
 the first question 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 Let's go what would you do if 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.379
 just before the quad nuclear of the Horst 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.379
 eschen goes 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.309
 Do you have a basic game of joy 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369
 or mourning crying people I once did 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.049
 cried with joy even as though 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.580
 barcelona against chelsea played in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.270
 jazzit semifinals that was that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.790
 back play 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.030
 he plays the game 1 0 and he jokes 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.189
 I think until 94 minutes or so 1 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 0 led and the nests there still the gate 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.250
 made and then I cried before 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 joy because through the away goals the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 succeeded barcelona anyway 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.100
 he has still retired in the final 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 the champs won later and yes that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.409
 definitely one of my most beautiful 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 Moments in front of the TV, so to speak 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 you already had stress with the police 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 be honest people i already had 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 sometimes stress with the police and that was 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.979
 I was six years old and there I was 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 stop in mÃ¼ller and the drugstore and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 then I have such a blatant pc game 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 SpongeBob Squarepants still seen 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.470
 it is somehow and I only thought so 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.899
 so oh my god i have to play this pc 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.399
 absolutely without shit but me 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.579
 of course, had no money 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.290
 and there I was so smart at the age of that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.180
 I thought so okay then I steal 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.009
 easy for me and that then I will 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.680
 unfortunately no dead place and location if 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.940
 I had it with me where I then 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.860
 against the car and where could I then 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
 Unfortunately , the police got caught 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.940
 but I have then 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.230
 get an admonition to luck and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.239
 had I think a month 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.819
 house ban as a six-year-old listener 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.620
 so definitely a pretty 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.569
 I would say unnecessary action 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.190
 Fabian wants to know how good would you be 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.269
 I can play without a lead 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.590
 actually not that over 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.239
 fiercest line I can do it once 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.660
 Show screenshot of my line 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.340
 to let 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.629
 So I can not do it anyway 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.400
 complain but of course there are now 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.680
 others still play a lot 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.780
 have better connection I would say 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.879
 I am on a 2k line early 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.340
 played and the difference between 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.030
 the 2k line and 100k is on each 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.410
 fall enormously 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.870
 but I also had in between times 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.099
 a 32 karl line and then you notice 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.519
 the difference actually honest 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.989
 do not say so blatantly what can you do 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.910
 get if you kill anyone with the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 anti 90 get 1 euro 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.530
 oh shit people i think i have 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.500
 alone with a clear account so 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.290
 at impact exposure over 40,000 kills 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.910
 only with such 490 and then with the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.500
 other accounts together than I think 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.160
 there is already a fairly high sum 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.569
 together 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.190
 so i think i could look at everyone 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.810
 a pretty fierce car with it 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.310
 pick up 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.959
 what would you do if marcel a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.950
 Woman would be and transsexual would be mine 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.870
 God people I want to be honest 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.639
 I can not imagine saying that, but me 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.200
 think he would be the character of him 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.280
 Do not change so I think so 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.010
 I would not do anything with you 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.450
 still be friends with him 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.069
 why a stuffed animal does not slip out 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.849
 the hand if you sweat like that can 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.560
 I actually quite easy 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.810
 answer and that is people behind 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 the skat so a grip on it 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.109
 I do not know if you can recognize it 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.900
 and especially in the summer you will notice 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.099
 yes pretty much that one stops 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.349
 handy is so to speak on the controller 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.389
 and that is already of advantage 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.639
 So I think that should be the question 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.950
 to be answered 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.630
 hannes asks you have pets so 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.310
 moment I have unfortunately no pets 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.650
 I had quite the time for such a small one 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.060
 hates him but our landlord has us 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.440
 then told we can not 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.910
 keep and unfortunately had to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.410
 someone to pass other 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.090
 After that we have a budgerigar 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.560
 then I think I had grown too 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.599
 For three years or so that is 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.209
 then died because somehow against that 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.010
 piano is flown in the living room and 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.840
 then we have ourselves in the squad 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.349
 I think I got five 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.209
 years 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.740
 but that is sooner or later 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.340
 sometime jumped from the balcony 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.650
 then probably ran away 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.669
 hare or something, and he has since 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.230
 we have not heard from him anymore 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.000
 unfortunately we have none at the moment 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.979
 pets but maybe i will 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.210
 somehow a hangover or something 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.880
 get it because I'm quite a bit 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.660
 cat's window I have something was yours 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.610
 worst experience in call of duty me 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.130
 believe that would have been the moment 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.590
 when i am one in front of the stairs nuclear 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.419
 I've been on slums multi team 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.729
 position I played there and me 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.889
 just look as well as the jerk so that 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.540
 Tom whether a centimeter on my head 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.790
 fly by I had it there 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.470
 fortunate enough, then I have the 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.510
 reached stairs I do not want to know 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.160
 I would really have done what I did 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.300
 one before Czechov because of the tower 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.100
 would have died 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.950
 but the moment I just 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.320
 see how the tor no millimeter mine 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.780
 head over flies that I really want 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.950
 do not wish anybody from you 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.419
 okay people that's it then already 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.880
 the whole question I hope I have the 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.289
 episode fell from faq last to everyone 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.970
 if positive 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.500
 you could watch the video and hold 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.030
 and if you also the most common 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.169
 I liked the background and I would 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.330
 let's say skin in 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.330
 until next time lucy
