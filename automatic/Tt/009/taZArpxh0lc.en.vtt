 19 degrees minutes that feels a lot 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.859
 heat I think it has to do with the 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.859
 heat several today first of the selection 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.759
 it is well what is much much bigger 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 wider a place where we will be able to 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.680
 special guests 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.450
 I have a caged television I've 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
 asked especially because I think that 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.790
 represents a little what we are all 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 crazy we have everything we do 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 then this represents a bit the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.190
 television embodied by this has said 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.320
 that everyone also goes through here 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 obviously and abide by is obviously the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 where will I be with my 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.479

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.840
 giant screen much more depth 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.720

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.149
 scenography in how many years 14 years 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.099
