 year 8 people I've visited aacd reef 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.399
 once I always tell people who have changed 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.050
 in life because I saw a child gives a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 step and a smile of hers was as if there 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.800
 had won the greatest gift and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.600
 most important of her life and the people 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 human being and has a tendency to complain 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.210
 everything small things we complain 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 When I saw that smile, it was 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 I need to change from there I asked a lot 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.140
 Goodbye for me to keep changing, I was 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 a better person than I take these 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 things in my life this does not lead to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.580
 us to anything and I as a mother 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.970
 I've been through some difficult times, my 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.110

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.410

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.670
 it is always the same any situation and 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.060

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.550
 Do you need help with aacd? 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.460
 from here we can tend very much 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.860
 a lot more people imagine my son is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.300
 a normal person can not imagine these 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.490
 children who need care 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.470

 I thank God, God blessed me a lot. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.630
 my life and those things that I never 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:28.610
 I thought I never imagined conquering 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.590
 But with God, we can do everything we did.
