00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 rather than cooking recipes from 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.560
 tristounette diet me I prefer 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.569
 lighten the classics 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 so today I attack the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 cheesecake me it's my favorite dessert 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 but let's say that usually he is at 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.990
 advise only people 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.130
 having a great need to take some 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 weight ie not big world 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 while with me version the cheesecake 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 pen is there everything is allowed 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 I put 100 g of biscuits if possible 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.650
 biscuits region is even better 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.390
 now we find them at all 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 scents you put them in the blender 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 and wanted to turn that one there he did 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.809
 not wanted this mix and too bad to do 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.340
 a dough where it's hot with the powder 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.649
 of biscuit it is still necessary butter 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 but not much 40 g that's enough I 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.620
 pour my cookies powder into my 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.020
 melted butter 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.180
 I add a tiny pinch of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.180
 salt for the Breton shortbread side 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 when I buy ice cream deposit of 50 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.620
 centilitres well I cut the top 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.000
 the turn is like that it makes me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.809
 little mussels see what's called 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 pastry circles 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.109
 I'm going to put my paw inside 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 my mold and you put that offered to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 take that would do exactly nam effect 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.860
 that a shortbread pastry now I'm going 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.960
 to take care of the cheese the technique is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.810
 to put cheese of faycelles 0% 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.299
 in a coffee filter up so the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.500
 to taste at most about 200 g of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.990
 white cheese for two people 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 and in there I will add a good 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 tablespoon 50 grams of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.970
 cream cheese I learned the saint 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 florentin because I think it's 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 what comes closest to the crime 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.799
 American cheese that is not found in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 France adds a little bit of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.880
 lemon and to have the flavor the scent 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 without the acidity I only take the zest 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 and I'm going to chop it with a knife 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 since we pay attention we go 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 until the end a little sweeteners and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.259
 here we have our trim now 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.540
 I had to fill my circles to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.220
 pastry in contention in good this is a 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.420
 very practical dessert very easy to 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 to realize but we must still foresee 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.970
 to do it apple ahead because it 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 must be at least three hours 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.630
 cool for cooking that's fine but for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.630
 the service I still have to learn 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.009
 you know the benefits of 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.780
 recipes lightening is that we can 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.780
 eat all day twice more
