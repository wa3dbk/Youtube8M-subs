00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello to everyone in the little bar we introduced 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.130
 innovation did we vegetarian 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.049
 burgers because a lot of very 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 freedivers divers but other 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm not like that but they don't want to eat 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.880
 meat asking for something so cunning 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 lines and we made this train easy 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.449
 cool recipe yourself actually 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 came up with tried it turns out like this 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.520
 and share with him today means 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
 look we take lentils 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.360
 so he and lentils such to her 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 be sure to soak in the water at night 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 in warm water at night leaves but not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.750
 longer in the legs once overexposed 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.350
 and held it for two days roughly she 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.329
 then sour braga turned out some sort 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.239
 have we need lentils soaked 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.539
 we will have to say disingenuous Well onions 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.270
 then carrot and cauliflower 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.480
 Well, it's clear that salt and pepper are starting 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.699
 do we cutlets mean take the blender 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 or what is your English term 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.210
 shuffled and so on look 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 we take lentils here and chop 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 here you can still mushrooms if you like 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.869
 mushrooms can add here yet 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.430
 mushrooms there a couple of cases that is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.140
 like this lentils should be 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 necessarily more than mushrooms or 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 cauliflower because it is 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.970
 link she is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.400
 it will be as well as flour as 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 eggs prosperity to cutlets held 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.850
 everything turns upside down therefore 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.869
 now we will grind 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.399
 Further, but then you need a little bit 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 too much left for us next time 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.259
