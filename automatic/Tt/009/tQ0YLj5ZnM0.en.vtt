proud of the props guys amazing stuff
there's<00:02:19.390> something<00:02:19.599> also<00:02:19.780> about<00:02:19.930> these

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
there's something also about these

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.600 
there's something also about these
helmets<00:02:20.290> away<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.769> curvature<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> glass

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
helmets away the curvature of the glass

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.759 
helmets away the curvature of the glass
we<00:02:22.209> worked<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.630> really<00:02:23.019> long<00:02:23.050> time<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.680> this

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
we worked for a really long time on this

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.890 
we worked for a really long time on this
glass<00:02:24.099> because<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.000> had<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.300> reflect<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
glass because it had to reflect the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.710 
glass because it had to reflect the
lights<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.920> are<00:02:27.040> there<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.489> can't<00:02:28.150> stop<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
lights that are there you can't stop the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.210 
lights that are there you can't stop the
lights<00:02:28.930> being<00:02:29.170> reflected<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> helmet<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.099> we

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
lights being reflected a helmet so we

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.229 
lights being reflected a helmet so we
have<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.459> work<00:02:30.610> with<00:02:30.640> our<00:02:30.849> director

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
have to work with our director

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.420 
have to work with our director
photographer<00:02:31.750> gone<00:02:31.900> mcalpine<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.130> exact

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
photographer gone mcalpine on the exact

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.460 
photographer gone mcalpine on the exact
right<00:02:33.610> curvature<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.360> reflect<00:02:34.750> patterns<00:02:35.319> of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
right curvature to reflect patterns of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.559 
right curvature to reflect patterns of
light<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.549> curvature<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> glass<00:02:37.360> that

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
light in the curvature of the glass that

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.910 
light in the curvature of the glass that
would<00:02:37.690> actually<00:02:38.110> look<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.290> visually

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
would actually look like visually

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440 
would actually look like visually
appealing<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:39.819> there<00:02:40.030> was<00:02:40.120> no<00:02:40.239> way<00:02:40.420> of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
appealing because there was no way of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.120 
appealing because there was no way of
saying<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:41.110> don't<00:02:41.260> want<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.560> see<00:02:41.709> reflections

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
saying we don't want to see reflections

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.059 
saying we don't want to see reflections
I<00:02:42.430> mean<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:43.060> put<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.269> glass<00:02:43.540> visor<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.590> someone

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
I mean you put a glass visor on someone

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.620 
I mean you put a glass visor on someone
and<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.400> get<00:02:45.549> reflections<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.330> we<00:02:46.450> turned

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
and you get reflections so we turned

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.449 
and you get reflections so we turned
that<00:02:46.780> into<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.110> virtue<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.890> think<00:02:48.280> if<00:02:48.370> you

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
that into a virtue and I think if you

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.009 
that into a virtue and I think if you
