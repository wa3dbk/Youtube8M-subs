00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
either want to learn my origami is you

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.680 
either want to learn my origami is you
heard<00:00:14.469> about<00:00:14.709> it<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.520> you<00:00:15.879> want<00:00:16.059> know<00:00:16.240> what<00:00:16.539> it

origami origami says that Ori
it<00:00:56.190> means<00:00:56.519> folding<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> call<00:00:57.690> me<00:00:57.809> means<00:00:58.019> paper

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it means folding and call me means paper

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
it means folding and call me means paper
I<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.489> why<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.820> call<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

origami it's call me that means paper

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
origami it's call me that means paper
but<00:01:03.180> whatever<00:01:03.869> I<00:01:04.110> mean<00:01:04.820> close<00:01:05.820> enough<00:01:06.060> right

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.160 

now<00:01:32.920> before<00:01:33.430> starting<00:01:33.610> origami<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.540> may<00:01:34.750> want

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
now before starting origami you may want

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.680 
now before starting origami you may want
to<00:01:35.290> get<00:01:35.920> some<00:01:36.100> origami<00:01:36.310> paper<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:37.270> can<00:01:37.420> find

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
to get some origami paper you can find

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.910 
to get some origami paper you can find
it<00:01:37.810> at<00:01:37.930> craft<00:01:38.500> stores<00:01:39.240> wherever<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:43.920> now

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
it at craft stores wherever really now

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.310 
it at craft stores wherever really now
here's<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.880> fun<00:01:46.090> bit<00:01:46.270> more<00:01:46.479> commie<00:01:46.810> action

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
here's the fun bit more commie action

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.460 
here's the fun bit more commie action
origami<00:01:47.679> it's<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.550> makes<00:01:48.759> things<00:01:48.940> move

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
origami it's like it makes things move

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.190 
origami it's like it makes things move
but<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:50.619> like<00:01:50.740> folded<00:01:51.100> paper<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.960> that's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
but it's like folded paper now that's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:02.669 
but it's like folded paper now that's
really<00:01:53.380> fun<00:02:01.259> something<00:02:02.259> else<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.530> might<00:02:02.619> want

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
really fun something else you might want

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:03.990 
really fun something else you might want
to<00:02:02.830> check<00:02:02.979> out<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.340> kirigami

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
to check out is kirigami

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.380 
to check out is kirigami
which<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.600> paper<00:02:04.750> cutting<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.500> pulled<00:02:12.390> lots

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
which is paper cutting and pulled lots

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
which is paper cutting and pulled lots
of<00:02:13.540> stuff<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:13.870> origami<00:02:14.320> where<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.799> make

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
of stuff in origami where you can make

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.800 
of stuff in origami where you can make
different<00:02:15.820> things<00:02:15.850> out<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.180> money<00:02:16.360> it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
different things out of money it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.530 
different things out of money it's
pretty<00:02:17.019> cool

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
pretty cool

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.789 
pretty cool
now<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.690> thing<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.989> called<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.290> water<00:02:20.560> ball

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
now this thing is called a water ball

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.410 
now this thing is called a water ball
and<00:02:21.040> we'll<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:21.790> into<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.299> in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and we'll get into that in this in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.720 
and we'll get into that in this in
future<00:02:22.540> videos<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:28.049> basically<00:02:29.049> if<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.220> are

interested<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.420> origami<00:02:31.840> stuff<00:02:33.090> you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
interested in and origami stuff you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
interested in and origami stuff you
might<00:02:34.269> want<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.690> check<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.959> my<00:02:35.079> channel
