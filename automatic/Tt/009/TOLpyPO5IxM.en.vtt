00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the first bead that I've added on my

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.030 
the first bead that I've added on my

going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.550> last<00:02:13.760> row<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.270> you've

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
going to be the last row that you've

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.430 
going to be the last row that you've
done<00:02:15.910> what<00:02:16.910> that's<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.300> do<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.840> make<00:02:18.290> my

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
done what that's going to do is make my

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.220 
done what that's going to do is make my
chili<00:02:18.710> bead<00:02:18.920> lay<00:02:19.190> nice<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.730> close<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.900> next

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
chili bead lay nice and close right next

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.100 
chili bead lay nice and close right next
to<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.590> first<00:02:22.340> row<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:23.000> I'm<00:02:23.720> creating<00:02:24.080> my

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
to that first row as I'm creating my

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.650 
to that first row as I'm creating my
second<00:02:24.620> row<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.800> Tila's<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.490> sew<00:02:26.120> back<00:02:26.390> up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
second row of Tila's I sew back up

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
second row of Tila's I sew back up
through<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.200> bead<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.340> basically<00:02:28.940> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
through that bead so it's basically a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.630 
through that bead so it's basically a
circle<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.930> thread<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.770> I'm<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> add<00:02:31.430> my
