00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
continue to grow in fact what will

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.190 
continue to grow in fact what will
happen<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.049> them

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
happen with these if you put them

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
happen with these if you put them
straight<00:01:25.409> unless<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:26.130> were<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.549> droop<00:01:26.909> and

then make sure that slant cut that just
gets<00:02:56.200> pushed<00:02:56.470> into<00:02:56.770> there<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:58.660> gets<00:02:59.080> pushed

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
gets pushed into there that gets pushed

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.500 
gets pushed into there that gets pushed
into<00:02:59.530> there<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.220> gets<00:03:00.490> put<00:03:00.790> into<00:03:01.090> there<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
into there that gets put into there and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.970 
into there that gets put into there and
or<00:03:04.510> was<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.900> right<00:03:05.170> India<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.770> said
