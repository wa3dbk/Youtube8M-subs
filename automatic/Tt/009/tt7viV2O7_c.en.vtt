one<00:02:33.600> they're<00:02:33.840> they're<00:02:34.110> pretty<00:02:34.140> expensive<00:02:34.680> to

produce on a commercial basis and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.780 
produce on a commercial basis and
therefore<00:02:38.460> make<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.560> high-end<00:02:40.560> product<00:02:41.430> in

therefore make it a high-end product in

therefore make it a high-end product in
its<00:02:41.970> initial<00:02:42.210> stages<00:02:42.420> most<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.410> what<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.740> saw

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
its initial stages most of what we saw

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.190 
its initial stages most of what we saw
was<00:02:44.370> where<00:02:45.300> microgreens<00:02:45.810> were<00:02:45.960> being

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
was where microgreens were being

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.310 
was where microgreens were being
utilized<00:02:46.380> were<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.450> high-end<00:02:48.450> restaurants<00:02:49.140> I

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
utilized were in high-end restaurants I

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.410 
utilized were in high-end restaurants I
think<00:02:49.800> most<00:02:50.160> microgreens<00:02:50.850> are<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.300> be

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
think most microgreens are going to be

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.330 
think most microgreens are going to be
grown<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.780> some<00:02:52.020> type<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.260> protected<00:02:52.950> culture

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
grown in some type of protected culture

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.910 
grown in some type of protected culture
like<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> greenhouse<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.900> shade<00:02:55.500> structure

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
like a greenhouse or a shade structure

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.000 
like a greenhouse or a shade structure
perhaps<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.360> they<00:02:57.690> are<00:02:57.990> very<00:02:58.350> tender<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
perhaps but they are very tender and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.890 
perhaps but they are very tender and
they're<00:02:59.760> gonna<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.330> protected<00:03:00.540> from

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
they're gonna have to be protected from

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.380 
they're gonna have to be protected from
rainfall<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.950> thus<00:03:02.550> most<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> systems

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
rainfall and thus most of the systems

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.490 
rainfall and thus most of the systems
that<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.630> used<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.050> have<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.260> heavy

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.350 
that are used if you have a heavy
rainfall<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.730> disrupt<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
rainfall it's going to disrupt the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.770 
rainfall it's going to disrupt the
seeding<00:03:06.780> process<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:08.660> typically<00:03:09.660> they're

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
seeding process so typically they're

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.680 
seeding process so typically they're
used<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.170> some<00:03:10.380> kind<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.770> protected<00:03:11.250> culture
