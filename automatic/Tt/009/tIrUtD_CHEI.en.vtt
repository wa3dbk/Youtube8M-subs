00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.360
Hi everyone!

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.420
I'm going to show my skincare routine today.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.600
First,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.480
This is a moisturizer, "Moist White 4" from IPSA.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.240
This product has number from 1 to 4, which expresses the moisture level.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.020
I have very dry skin, 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.240
so, I choose "4", the highest moisture level.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.400
Let me show you the texture.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.220
It has ultralight silk texture.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.100
It is very smooth.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.980
Only 2 drops will be enough to spread it all over to your neck.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.600
Then I always do a little massage.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.000
That was my moisturizer.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.620
Next is,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.200
"Night Memory Moisture" by ORBIS

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.660
Can you look inside?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.400
It looks like empty, but actually there's a special cream in it.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.140
The cream is so thick and it's almost like a shape-memory cream.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.220
Even if you take a bit of cream with your finger like this,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.340
just leave it for a while, and it gets flat again as it was.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.320
It works on the skin, too.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.860
This cream firms the skin and lifts up the wrinkles.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.820
It's thick of course, but at the same time it's really smooth and easy to spread.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.840
When I apply it at night, I get so different in the morning.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.700
I heard that this is the new product from ORBIS.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.060
If you have dry skin trouble, please try.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.260
This moisturizer I introduced has very high moisture level, as I said before.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.560
But for more hydration,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.700
I prefer to use this cream after the moisturizer.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700
It'll be perfect.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.200
At last, I'll show this acne spot treatment by Ettusais.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.140
I sometimes have trouble with breakouts.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.900
It helps me relief them.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.600
It also clears and purifies the pores.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.280
I often have skin troubles on this area,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.040
or maybe some of you might have trouble around here.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.680
Let's see how it is.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.460
It's a transparent gel.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.580
It is smooth and adds moisture, too.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.840
The moisture controls the oil balance.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.260
Please have a try, if you have acne troubles.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.060
That's all for my skincare routine.
