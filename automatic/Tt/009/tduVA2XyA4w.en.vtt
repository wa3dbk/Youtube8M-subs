00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.919
 considering the fact that many people 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.820
 who follow me are interested in knowing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.500
 of the national wheel 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 really many of you didn't believe me 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.740
 so many scouts followed and some me 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 have directly asked to give us a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 video about here you are satisfied ruth 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.859
 national because I'm doing it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
 notice for non scouts the route is that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.220
 summer camp consisting of only one 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.920
 average walking time of 8 days 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.170
 what the scouts do between the ages of 16 and 21 is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.179
 a group of scouts between 16 and 21 years old 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.969
 he calls clans like falling woods 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.620
 no, or better , in practice but it is not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
 this point 6 a kaka woods 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 ok i am kaka woods you shut up husband i have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 said zito the national route is one 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.940
 scout route from a whole nation 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 30,000 morio a fucka 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840
 obviously you can't walk 30,000 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 iamm scout all together and then the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 route was divided into two parts part 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.820
 mobile where clans divided into groups of three 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 they united to walk and go to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.660
 some part together for five days 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.489
 and then there was the other five fixed field 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 days where all 30,000 were 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.670
 in the same place as regards 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.590
 the mobile part we joined gods 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 genoa boys and others considers one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.439
 city near vicenza beautiful mountains 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 places of the First World War 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.229
 non-World War I cemetery 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.760
 we know what the hell to eat and others 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.080
 things no part jokes places were 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 really happy sent to the plateau 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 of asiago between Veneto and Trentino 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 ok now step to the part of interest 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.479
 all I believe and the fixed field does not 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.549
 I've never seen so many scouts all 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.509
 together the field was arranged along one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.369
 main road 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.900
 at the sides of this road there were stretches 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.119
 of tents ok the field was divided into 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 sectors of about 5,000 people here was 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 the entrance then there was the sector to that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 b and il cedar etc. I was at the last 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
 sector at the last tent of the last 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 I spent an hour on the sector 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.470
 reaching the goal from the entrance we were 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 so many that each subfield had a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.130
 stage used to give information for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.329
 I don't know why the round tables 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 they were just like that 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.619
 conferences and then there was a lot of stage 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.210
 bigger at the end of the road then 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 I was further from the entrance but more 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 near the stage it was used for the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 initial and final ceremony and for 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.439
 a concert was also not really a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.180
 concert was tv a show bar 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.710
 concert doesn't do what in the end there 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 we are all asleep 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.219
 no because it was boring indeed it was one 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 cool we were all too tired and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.159
 sitting on the grass for too long three hours 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.170
 and then at the end of the show 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.729
 they'll just be guys talking for 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 strength we fell asleep on then there was 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.509
 a guy who had made himself peaceful a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.189
 rowing 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.439
 it's called alex bellini look it up 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.299
 wikipedia many of you under the video or 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.189
 on the page you wrote me that 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.540
 you would have been to the national network 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.459
 I met two of you and he did me 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.500
 very pleased and it is already so much since 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.970
 that field was boundless some after the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.890
 route they wrote me that they had me 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.579
 seen but they didn't greet me because 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.959
 in the sense 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 mica i eat this a warning for 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.560
 all and if you see me and want me 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.000
 greeting me is just pleasure 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.920
 I must say that these routes have also been 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.359
 an intensive diet delivered by everyone 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.549
 dieticians because they could eat 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.170
 only homogenized and cheese shapes 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.120
 I don't say really come back from the ruth 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.560
 I weighed 5 kg less and considering that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.120
 from morning to evening and often also 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 after evening we did nothing but 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.790
 move we should have eaten more than 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 normal 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.030
 nonetheless probably more badly 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.739
 calories to go to the tent where 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.970
 distributed the meals of those that a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.069
 which you can eat the same meal 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.840
 there were some big gazebos like that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.920
 where they gave you a box for meals 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.810
 for all the clan then 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.310
 homogenized were not bad either 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.650
 Parmesan is a problem 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.120
 He clamps that there was renzi who promised 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.409
 that the money saved in energy 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.900
 public thanks to new technologies 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.549
 will be invested in education 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.569
 we hope it's true you can find the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.569
 speech on the internet
