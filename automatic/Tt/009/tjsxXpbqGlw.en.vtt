ground for everyone to kind of get

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
ground for everyone to kind of get
things<00:01:00.899> settled<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> good<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.030> for

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.929

everyone<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.729> took<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
everyone so you know I think it took a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.980 
everyone so you know I think it took a
little<00:01:06.119> longer<00:01:06.210> than<00:01:06.540> everyone<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
little longer than everyone would have

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.649 
little longer than everyone would have
liked<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> end<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> day

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
liked but I think at the end of the day

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.020 
liked but I think at the end of the day
everyone<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.869> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.700> think

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
everyone was able to do that so I think

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
everyone was able to do that so I think
like<00:01:12.659> anything<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.260> try<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> trust<00:01:13.830> your

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
like anything you just try to trust your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.830 
like anything you just try to trust your
instincts<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> move<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.509> there

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

like<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.890> prepared<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.430> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
like you know I can I'm as prepared as I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.780 
like you know I can I'm as prepared as I
can<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> group<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:41.100> we

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
can be and I think as a group here we

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
can be and I think as a group here we
have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> lot<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> same<00:01:42.509> faces<00:01:43.020> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
have a lot of the same faces so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
have a lot of the same faces so
hopefully<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.009> helps<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> start

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
hopefully that helps here from the start

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
hopefully that helps here from the start
of<00:01:45.119> season<00:01:45.470> said<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> been<00:01:46.979> doing

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
were down in Phoenix and I guess guys

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
were down in Phoenix and I guess guys
have<00:01:50.939> been<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.479> places<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.990> mean

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
have been in different places I mean

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.480 
have been in different places I mean
what<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> been<00:01:52.649> trying<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.340> get

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
what have you been trying to do to get

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.819 
what have you been trying to do to get
ready<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> jumpstart<00:01:55.470> yourself

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
ready to be able to jumpstart yourself

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
ready to be able to jumpstart yourself
now<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.610> seven<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.090> eight<00:01:57.180> days

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
now with you know seven or eight days

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
now with you know seven or eight days
before<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.840> start<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> season<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:59.520> we've

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
before we start the season I think we've

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.429 
before we start the season I think we've
just<00:01:59.909> been<00:02:00.060> skating<00:02:00.659> pretty<00:02:00.899> consistently

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
just been skating pretty consistently

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
just been skating pretty consistently
here<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.579> had<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> pretty<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:02.969> group<00:02:03.299> we

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
here and we had a pretty good group we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.929 
here and we had a pretty good group we
had<00:02:03.540> 10<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> 12<00:02:04.079> guys<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.590> were<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:04.950> skating

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
had 10 to 12 guys that were here skating

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.719 
had 10 to 12 guys that were here skating
probably<00:02:06.299> four<00:02:06.479> times<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.899> week<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:08.520> those

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
probably four times a week so in those

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.309 
probably four times a week so in those
skates<00:02:09.090> guys<00:02:09.360> seemed<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> push<00:02:10.140> themselves

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
skates guys seemed to push themselves

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.559 
skates guys seemed to push themselves
pretty<00:02:10.739> good<00:02:11.009> and

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
pretty good and

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.420 
pretty good and
the<00:02:12.140> guys<00:02:12.319> who<00:02:12.499> weren't<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:12.920> we're<00:02:13.099> we're

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the guys who weren't here we're we're

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.759 
the guys who weren't here we're we're
playing<00:02:13.700> somewhere<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.290> guys<00:02:15.439> who<00:02:15.650> have

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
playing somewhere so the guys who have

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.319 
playing somewhere so the guys who have
played<00:02:16.010> are<00:02:16.249> definitely<00:02:16.790> going<00:02:16.879> to<00:02:16.969> benefit

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
played are definitely going to benefit

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.640 
played are definitely going to benefit
from<00:02:17.389> that<00:02:17.659> I<00:02:17.719> think<00:02:18.019> especially<00:02:18.139> at<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
from that I think especially at the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.339 
from that I think especially at the
start<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.510> from<00:02:20.510> what<00:02:20.629> I've<00:02:20.749> seen<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
start so from what I've seen here at the

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.199 
start so from what I've seen here at the
start<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> cap<00:02:21.859> everyone<00:02:22.340> looks<00:02:22.579> like<00:02:22.819> they're

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
start a cap everyone looks like they're

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.670 
start a cap everyone looks like they're
in<00:02:23.329> pretty<00:02:23.510> good<00:02:23.599> shape<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.230> then<00:02:24.319> ready<00:02:24.590> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
in pretty good shape and then ready to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
in pretty good shape and then ready to
go<00:02:24.829> so<00:02:25.239> hopefully<00:02:26.239> that'll<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.599> that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
go so hopefully that'll make that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.629 
go so hopefully that'll make that
transition<00:02:27.109> as<00:02:27.680> easy<00:02:28.189> as<00:02:28.459> possible

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
transition as easy as possible

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.899 
transition as easy as possible
considering<00:02:29.859> you<00:02:30.859> know<00:02:30.920> no<00:02:31.099> preseason<00:02:31.519> games

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
considering you know no preseason games

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.099 
considering you know no preseason games
and<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.269> starting<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.599> off<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> bat

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
and we're starting right off the bat

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.379 
and we're starting right off the bat
here<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.819> everyone<00:02:34.819> looks<00:02:35.030> pretty<00:02:35.239> good

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
here but everyone looks pretty good

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.509 
here but everyone looks pretty good
Sydney<00:02:36.139> you<00:02:36.230> mentioned<00:02:36.620> not<00:02:36.859> a<00:02:36.889> lot<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.099> roster

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
Sydney you mentioned not a lot of roster

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.220 
Sydney you mentioned not a lot of roster
turnover<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.269> Penguins<00:02:38.480> how<00:02:38.959> might<00:02:39.200> that

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
turnover for the Penguins how might that

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530 
turnover for the Penguins how might that
impact<00:02:39.799> things<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:41.060> don't<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.359> a<00:02:41.389> lot<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
impact things we don't have a lot of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.629 
impact things we don't have a lot of
time<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.840> get<00:02:41.930> ready<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:43.489> gonna

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
time to get ready I think it's gonna

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.159 
time to get ready I think it's gonna
help<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:44.090> mean<00:02:44.269> we're<00:02:44.419> all<00:02:44.510> familiar<00:02:44.689> with<00:02:44.930> one

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
help I mean we're all familiar with one

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.059 
help I mean we're all familiar with one
another<00:02:45.430> guys<00:02:46.430> understand<00:02:46.969> their<00:02:47.150> roles<00:02:47.329> and

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
another guys understand their roles and

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.770 
another guys understand their roles and
yeah<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.129> think<00:02:49.219> that<00:02:49.609> can<00:02:49.730> only<00:02:49.849> help<00:02:50.299> us<00:02:50.569> with

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
yeah I think that can only help us with

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.259 
yeah I think that can only help us with
the<00:02:50.959> shortened<00:02:51.379> season<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.010> we're<00:02:52.969> hoping

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the shortened season so we're hoping

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.789 
the shortened season so we're hoping
that's<00:02:53.449> the<00:02:53.540> case<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:54.109> at<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:54.530> end<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
that's the case and at the end of the

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.959 
that's the case and at the end of the
day<00:02:54.919> you<00:02:54.980> still<00:02:55.219> have<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.489> go<00:02:55.609> out<00:02:55.669> there<00:02:55.879> and

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
day you still have to go out there and

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.599 
day you still have to go out there and
play<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.329> execute<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.219> you<00:02:58.219> know<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.459> little

hiccups<00:02:59.030> for<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.329> little<00:02:59.480> adjustments<00:02:59.930> you

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
hiccups for the little adjustments you

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.319 
hiccups for the little adjustments you
have<00:03:00.109> to<00:03:00.230> make<00:03:00.379> early<00:03:00.709> sometimes<00:03:00.949> with<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.669> lot

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
of new guys or new systems yeah that's

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.390 
of new guys or new systems yeah that's
something<00:03:05.090> hopefully<00:03:05.510> we<00:03:05.629> can<00:03:05.750> kind<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:06.019> avoid

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
something hopefully we can kind of avoid

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
something hopefully we can kind of avoid

run and then things got derailed in a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
run and then things got derailed in a
kind<00:03:17.269> of<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.449> crazy<00:03:17.689> first<00:03:18.079> round<00:03:18.409> series

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
kind of a crazy first round series

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.140 
kind of a crazy first round series
against<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.129> flyers<00:03:19.370> you've<00:03:19.729> had<00:03:19.879> some<00:03:20.120> time

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.999 
might have went wrong I don't have any
for<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:30.079> know<00:03:30.169> there's<00:03:30.349> a<00:03:30.409> lot<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.680> things

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.009 
for you you know there's a lot of things

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.710 
for you you know there's a lot of things
it's<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:31.879> a<00:03:31.939> pretty<00:03:32.150> tough<00:03:32.359> one<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.689> explain

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
it's it's a pretty tough one to explain

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.030 
it's it's a pretty tough one to explain
I<00:03:33.079> don't<00:03:33.349> think<00:03:33.530> you're<00:03:33.620> going<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.799> see<00:03:33.859> a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
I don't think you're going to see a

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.399 
I don't think you're going to see a
series<00:03:34.459> like<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.909> any<00:03:35.870> time<00:03:36.109> in<00:03:36.229> the<00:03:36.290> near

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
series like that any time in the near

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.619 
series like that any time in the near
future<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.979> was<00:03:37.129> it<00:03:37.759> was<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:37.909> wild<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.479> weird

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
future it was it was a wild and weird

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.379 
future it was it was a wild and weird
one<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.669> exciting<00:03:40.669> for<00:03:40.879> everyone<00:03:41.060> involved

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
one but exciting for everyone involved

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.449 
one but exciting for everyone involved
it's<00:03:41.720> tough<00:03:42.349> being<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.769> losing<00:03:42.919> end<00:03:43.189> of<00:03:43.340> it

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it's tough being on the losing end of it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.909 
it's tough being on the losing end of it
but<00:03:43.729> I<00:03:43.939> think<00:03:44.629> if<00:03:44.720> anything<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.590> learned<00:03:45.799> the

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
but I think if anything you learned the

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.240 
but I think if anything you learned the
playoffs<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.639> a<00:03:47.060> different<00:03:47.810> season<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.349> as

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
playoffs is a different season and as

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.499 
playoffs is a different season and as
good<00:03:49.430> as<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.579> do<00:03:49.669> in<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.849> regular<00:03:50.120> season<00:03:50.299> it

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:50.509 
good as you do in the regular season it

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:51.909 
good as you do in the regular season it
doesn't<00:03:50.780> matter<00:03:50.930> come<00:03:51.229> playoff<00:03:51.530> time<00:03:51.560> you

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
doesn't matter come playoff time you

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.319 
doesn't matter come playoff time you
still<00:03:52.129> have<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.430> execute<00:03:52.669> and<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> same

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
still have to execute and do the same

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.009 
still have to execute and do the same
things<00:03:53.629> probably<00:03:54.379> at<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.099> higher<00:03:55.250> level<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.019> we

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
things probably at a higher level so we

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.209 
things probably at a higher level so we
did<00:03:57.139> a<00:03:57.199> lot<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.349> great<00:03:57.590> things<00:03:57.620> during<00:03:58.099> the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
did a lot of great things during the

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.610 
did a lot of great things during the
regular<00:03:58.519> season<00:03:58.699> and<00:03:59.030> unfortunately<00:03:59.620> you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
regular season and unfortunately you

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.080 
regular season and unfortunately you
know<00:04:00.739> come<00:04:00.979> playoff<00:04:01.310> time<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:01.759> probably

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
know come playoff time we probably

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.569 
know come playoff time we probably
didn't<00:04:02.329> execute<00:04:02.569> quite<00:04:02.900> as<00:04:03.019> well<00:04:03.169> and<00:04:03.469> we<00:04:04.340> paid

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
didn't execute quite as well and we paid

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.990 
didn't execute quite as well and we paid
for<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:04.879> but<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.989> know<00:04:06.019> Philly<00:04:06.349> played<00:04:06.620> well

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
for it but you know Philly played well

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.909 
for it but you know Philly played well
you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.150> seems<00:04:08.329> like<00:04:08.449> every<00:04:09.319> chance<00:04:09.590> both

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
you know it seems like every chance both

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.249 
you know it seems like every chance both
teams<00:04:10.219> got<00:04:10.459> they<00:04:11.419> seemed<00:04:11.659> to<00:04:11.689> execute<00:04:12.109> well

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:12.259 
teams got they seemed to execute well

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.229 
teams got they seemed to execute well
and<00:04:12.439> put<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.739> back<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.129> net<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.489> it's

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
and put in the back of the net and it's

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.120 
and put in the back of the net and it's
kind<00:04:14.449> of<00:04:14.479> like<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.750> last<00:04:14.959> goal<00:04:15.199> was<00:04:15.919> going<00:04:16.070> to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
kind of like the last goal was going to

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.190 
kind of like the last goal was going to
win<00:04:16.310> at<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.639> point<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.359> seemed<00:04:17.659> like<00:04:17.870> so

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
win at that point it seemed like so

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.720 
win at that point it seemed like so
you<00:04:19.410> know<00:04:19.500> they<00:04:19.650> just<00:04:19.770> they<00:04:20.340> were<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.580> better

I think we're okay with that pressure
you<00:04:47.610> know<00:04:47.700> realistically<00:04:48.560> it's<00:04:49.560> tough<00:04:50.130> I<00:04:50.370> mean

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
you know realistically it's tough I mean

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.270 
you know realistically it's tough I mean
there's<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.630> many<00:04:51.750> teams<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:53.010> are<00:04:53.130> so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
there's so many teams that that are so

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.940 
there's so many teams that that are so
good<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.420> competition<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:55.140> league<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.500> is

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
good and the competition a league is is

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.460 
good and the competition a league is is
great<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:57.660> know<00:04:57.720> we're<00:04:57.870> okay<00:04:57.960> with<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.410> I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
great so you know we're okay with that I

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.280 
great so you know we're okay with that I
think<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.890> something<00:04:59.040> we<00:04:59.250> understand<00:04:59.730> and

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
think it's something we understand and

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.390 
think it's something we understand and
you<00:05:01.290> know<00:05:01.380> last<00:05:01.590> few<00:05:01.800> years<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.160> kind<00:05:02.340> of

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
you know last few years it's kind of

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.340 
you know last few years it's kind of
been<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> case<00:05:02.790> but<00:05:03.120> i<00:05:03.180> think<00:05:03.420> we<00:05:03.510> all<00:05:03.540> also

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
been the case but i think we all also

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.130 
been the case but i think we all also
know<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:05.000> it's<00:05:06.000> tough<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.570> you've<00:05:06.840> got<00:05:07.050> to

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
know that it's tough and you've got to

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.410 
know that it's tough and you've got to
prove<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.380> each<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.800> every<00:05:07.920> year<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.460> i

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
prove that each and every year and i

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.820 
prove that each and every year and i
think<00:05:10.050> that's<00:05:10.200> something<00:05:10.320> we're<00:05:10.560> willing<00:05:10.800> to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
think that's something we're willing to

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.130 
think that's something we're willing to
deal<00:05:11.070> with<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:12.000> don't<00:05:12.360> mind<00:05:12.540> that<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:12.990> I

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
deal with so I I don't mind that and I

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.080 
deal with so I I don't mind that and I
don't<00:05:13.170> think<00:05:13.410> we<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.710> either<00:05:13.830> they<00:05:14.790> said

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
don't think we do either they said

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.300 
don't think we do either they said
