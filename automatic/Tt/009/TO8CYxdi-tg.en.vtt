00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.700
 When I came to your country I did not know what to expect ... 

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.755
 In fact I did not know what to expect in all of Latin America ... 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.760
 because I've never done a tour here before ... 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.950
 And I can not believe you all came !!! 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.680
 I can not believe you all want to spend time with me! 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.600
 I love being with you !!! 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.100
 So... 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.521
 I just wanted to let you know that ... continue to inspire me !! 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 Thank you Brazil for your inspiration! 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.100
 Since I arrived in Brazil I have spent the nights 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.109
 drinking, smoking and making music 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 Looking out the window and laughing 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 Making new friends. 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.075
 I made many new friends in Brazil. 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.612
 Thank you for inviting me to come to this beautiful place !!!! 

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:39.212
 And if you invite me again I promise I will not stop making music, okay? 

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:45.374
 So... 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 One of my favorite things about Brazil 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 is that you are not afraid to show your emotions 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.600
 I am italian... 

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.101
 I am... 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.950
 And we show our emotions a lot. 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 And some people do not understand that we are different 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 So I feel a very strong connection when I'm here 

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:16.251
 Because... 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:21.199
 even if we do not speak the same language, I know you understand what I say 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.600
 Brazil has so many different places ... 

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:35.628
 with so many different people ... 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 But ... under the same city ... 

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:40.928
 And under the same country ... 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.500
 All these different people are together on behalf of Brazil! 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.100
 So I want to dedicate tonight ... 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.600
 I want to dedicate this ... this ... show in Brazil ... 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.300
 I want to dedicate this show ... 

00:02:59.301 --> 00:03:01.078
 on behalf of Peace in your country !!! 

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.099
 I want to dedicate this show to peace between our countries 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
 And I hope coming here ... 

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.103
 I can be the same inspiration for you as you inspire me. 

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:21.003
 Because I feel like I can write a million songs ... about Brazil! 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.400
 So... 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 This is just a song ... 

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:33.903
 Written a long time ago ... 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 And when I wrote it ... 

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.403
 I did not know... 

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:40.678
 I was writing the lyrics for you ... 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:41.879
 but I was... 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.703
 This song is called "Hair" 

00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:02.484
 Yes, I am real! 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.174
 She keeps saying, "She's real, she's real !!!" 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.600
 "IT'S REAL ... IT'S REAL !!!" 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.260
 Your bow is so fabulous!
