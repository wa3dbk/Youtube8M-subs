00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the camera now you want to be able to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.530 
the camera now you want to be able to
ride<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.829> skateboard<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.489> bit<00:00:35.790> it's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ride a skateboard a little bit it's

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
ride a skateboard a little bit it's
always<00:00:36.719> best<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> practice<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> concrete

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
always best to practice this on concrete

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
always best to practice this on concrete
or<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> street<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
or the street so that way when you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.450 
or the street so that way when you
actually<00:00:40.410> take<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> street<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.280> right

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
actually take it to the street you right

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.150 
actually take it to the street you right
guess<00:00:42.300> carpet<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
guess carpet you can use it to get the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
guess carpet you can use it to get the
technique<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:44.789> having<00:00:44.940> trouble<00:00:45.000> but

we'll make it harder once you go on the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.560 
we'll make it harder once you go on the
heart<00:00:47.820> grow<00:00:49.129> foot<00:00:50.129> positioning<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
heart grow foot positioning and your

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.540 
heart grow foot positioning and your
body<00:00:52.340> important<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> some<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.430> will

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
body important you know some people will

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.920 
body important you know some people will
have<00:00:56.699> their<00:00:56.730> foot<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> way<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.539> here<00:00:57.600> like

have their foot all the way up here like
that<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:59.280> barely<00:00:59.640> ever<00:00:59.879> works<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
that that barely ever works out and you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
that that barely ever works out and you
won't<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.870> height<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> when<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> if

you jump snap and then obviously know
you<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> slide<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:26.159> course<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> probably

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you do the slide of course you probably

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.719 
you do the slide of course you probably
know<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.920> getting<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> work<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
know that but getting it all the work in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.749 
know that but getting it all the work in
one<00:01:30.000> motion<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> problem<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> tie<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
one motion is the problem and tie me you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.450 
one motion is the problem and tie me you
know<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.030> try<00:01:33.210> different<00:01:33.479> timings<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
know just try different timings and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:46.540 
know just try different timings and
that's<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> most<00:01:35.700> important<00:01:36.119> thing

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.230 

see<00:01:47.550> how<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.790> kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> role<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:49.410> want<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.150 
see how that kind of role you want a
good<00:01:51.240> rolling<00:01:51.660> motion<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.620> some<00:01:52.830> people<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
good rolling motion now some people just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:06.700 
good rolling motion now some people just
go<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.140> cousin<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.620> get<00:01:55.770> it

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.130 

bend<00:02:07.710> down<00:02:08.090> jump<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.330> some<00:02:09.479> spring<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.020> want

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
bend down jump get some spring you want

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.840 
bend down jump get some spring you want
to<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.290> pressure<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.370> kick

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
to have pressure on this it's not a kick

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.590 
to have pressure on this it's not a kick
it's<00:02:12.570> more<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.080> snap<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.190> quick<00:02:14.880> snap<00:02:15.390> with

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it's more like a snap a quick snap with

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
it's more like a snap a quick snap with
pressure<00:02:15.990> before<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.490> pressure

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
pressure before it you know a pressure

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.260 
pressure before it you know a pressure
on<00:02:18.590> also<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.650> want<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.160> standing<00:02:20.790> straight

to<00:05:21.719> move<00:05:21.930> faster<00:05:22.469> and<00:05:22.650> faster<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.129> then<00:05:23.249> you

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:23.339 
to move faster and faster and then you

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:27.200 
to move faster and faster and then you
can<00:05:23.490> do<00:05:23.999> gaps<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.599> stuff<00:05:24.809> like<00:05:25.229> this<00:05:26.089> once<00:05:27.089> you

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
can do gaps and stuff like this once you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.140 
can do gaps and stuff like this once you
get<00:05:27.389> them<00:05:27.629> try<00:05:27.900> rolling<00:05:28.430> even<00:05:29.430> just<00:05:29.639> this<00:05:29.789> slow

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
get them try rolling even just this slow

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.029 
get them try rolling even just this slow
at<00:05:30.360> first<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.870> help<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.289> then<00:05:31.889> eventually

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
at first the help and then eventually

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.100 
at first the help and then eventually
get<00:05:32.999> faster<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.599> faster<00:05:34.279> and<00:05:35.839> go<00:05:36.839> a<00:05:36.870> little

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
get faster and faster and go a little

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:45.769 
get faster and faster and go a little
bit<00:05:37.319> faster<00:05:43.909> that<00:05:44.909> wasn't<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.240> very<00:05:45.360> good<00:05:45.479> ally

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
bit faster that wasn't a very good ally

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.129 
bit faster that wasn't a very good ally
but<00:05:46.110> just<00:05:46.860> even<00:05:47.330> allying<00:05:48.330> over<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.809> crack<00:05:49.110> in

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
but just even allying over a crack in

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.249 
but just even allying over a crack in
the<00:05:49.289> driveway<00:05:49.589> is<00:05:49.949> a<00:05:49.979> good<00:05:50.219> first<00:05:50.490> start<00:05:51.259> then

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
the driveway is a good first start then

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.469 
the driveway is a good first start then
try<00:05:52.529> an<00:05:52.589> obstacle<00:05:53.009> the<00:05:53.699> first<00:05:53.939> obstacle<00:05:54.180> I

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
try an obstacle the first obstacle I

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.019 
try an obstacle the first obstacle I
light<00:05:55.020> over<00:05:55.319> was<00:05:55.439> a<00:05:55.469> hose<00:05:55.680> it's<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.610> good<00:05:56.789> first

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
light over was a hose it's a good first

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.700 
light over was a hose it's a good first
obstacle<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.659> try<00:05:57.839> because<00:05:58.199> nothing<00:05:58.469> really

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
obstacle to try because nothing really

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.860 
obstacle to try because nothing really
happening

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.889 

you

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:07.899 

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.269 

once<00:06:08.899> you're<00:06:09.080> really<00:06:09.379> good<00:06:09.529> like<00:06:09.830> me<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.249> can

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
once you're really good like me you can

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.699 
once you're really good like me you can
try<00:06:10.580> again
