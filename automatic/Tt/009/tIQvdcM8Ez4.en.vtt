00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 I'm in the crazy town workshop that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.069
 here is giving me the guitar to the stubborn 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.179
 reassured Miguel as you can see 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.630
 this inter is an amazing thing is very 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.690
 cute fairy stadium 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.840
 but it's very easy it was pretty cool 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.750
 good although this I do not know 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.830
 leave me some message for the people of 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 the fans of Miguel who are going to be 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 watching these surely 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.910
 we know that this guitar represents 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.060
 many things so they told you rock 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 live in the black telecaster and all that 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.510
 but good 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.220
 what it was like to do something like that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.860
 good these weights 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.420
 with a call from you when 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.810
 you told me you wanted to make a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810
 present 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.530
 to do it so nothing like 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.550
 as a fan of Argentine rock 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 to have listened 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 weather 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.230
 it's a project that closed me for all 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.190
 sides so 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.370
 that we gave nothing to forward 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.070
 and came the idea to be telecaster 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.190
 and black we put some elephant 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.850
 canada to make it even more elegant 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.090
 in xinjiang 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.140
 that shows the wood of the body 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.840
 two microphones p 90 handle maple shovel 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.090
 from 70 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.109
 my logo and the name of Miguel 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.630
 so nothing for me is a huge pleasure 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.229
 a guitar for me that represents 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.229
 so much 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.750
 for everything you asked for the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.530
 disc of what you have lived with Miguel 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 black 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 to 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.060
 the opportunity if it is here is clear 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.430
 asked in my house that represents 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.110
 many things represent many years of 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.460
 friendship many years of good vibes and that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.590
 at least I from my side wanted 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.930
 return in guitar form and at the same 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.440
 time represents that an artist like 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.970
 miguel that walks through all america can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.220
 carry in your hand an instrument made 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.890
 with an Argentine for a craftsman like 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.020
 you tell us he does things that I 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.790
 I think you have to know him because 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.770
 They are very hard and I have two guitars 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.860
 yours 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.610
 and I really do not think I need anything 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.980
 more so I like to share it and good 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.950
 I am very very happy because you did 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.440
 you did what I wanted and you improved it 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.740
 you put everything inside and good 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.860
 spectacular 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.860
 let's hope you like it, you said yes 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.400
 so let's go 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.960
 of your hands playing the skin themes and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.200
 now I can touch 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.350

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.900
