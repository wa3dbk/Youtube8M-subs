in the end but most the time you don't

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.660 
in the end but most the time you don't
need<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.280> anyway

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
need that anyway

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.700 
need that anyway
and<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.510> takes<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.870> left<00:03:15.020> chicken<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.560> make<00:03:15.650> a

and it takes a left chicken to make a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.890 
and it takes a left chicken to make a
flavorful<00:03:16.160> stock<00:03:16.580> this<00:03:16.820> way<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:17.480> cooks<00:03:17.660> it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
flavorful stock this way and it cooks it

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.050 
flavorful stock this way and it cooks it
lot<00:03:18.200> less<00:03:18.440> time<00:03:18.710> so<00:03:19.280> overall<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.910> a

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
lot less time so overall it's a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.030 
lot less time so overall it's a
win-win-win<00:03:20.840> situation<00:03:21.050> far<00:03:21.800> as<00:03:21.890> I'm

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.100 
up with the strainer releases the rest
of<00:06:13.889> it<00:06:14.009> to<00:06:14.340> evaporate<00:06:15.120> more<00:06:15.300> quickly<00:06:15.599> now<00:06:18.110> is

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
of it to evaporate more quickly now is

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.580 
of it to evaporate more quickly now is
more<00:06:19.439> of<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.250> surface<00:06:20.939> of<00:06:21.389> liquids<00:06:21.990> exposed

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
more of the surface of liquids exposed

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.339 
more of the surface of liquids exposed
so<00:06:23.250> if<00:06:23.430> it<00:06:23.639> will<00:06:23.789> start<00:06:24.120> evaporating<00:06:24.349> little

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
so if it will start evaporating little

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.830 
so if it will start evaporating little
bit<00:06:25.500> quicker<00:06:25.770> than<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.129> was<00:06:26.340> as<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:27.479> volume

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
bit quicker than it was as the volume

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.080 
bit quicker than it was as the volume
decreases<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:29.069> temperature<00:06:29.580> will<00:06:29.849> increase

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
decreases the temperature will increase

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.110 
decreases the temperature will increase
and<00:06:30.779> when<00:06:31.620> you<00:06:31.740> get<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.159> where<00:06:32.370> you're<00:06:32.699> reading

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
and when you get to where you're reading

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.879 
and when you get to where you're reading
a<00:06:33.360> temperature<00:06:33.810> above<00:06:34.020> about<00:06:34.319> 90<00:06:34.770> degrees

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
a temperature above about 90 degrees

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.730 
a temperature above about 90 degrees
Celsius<00:06:35.639> you<00:06:36.270> know<00:06:36.449> it's<00:06:36.629> it's<00:06:36.930> reached<00:06:37.560> a

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
Celsius you know it's it's reached a

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.379 
Celsius you know it's it's reached a
point<00:06:37.979> where<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:38.339> should<00:06:38.550> probably<00:06:38.759> stop<00:06:39.210> it

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
point where you should probably stop it

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.769 
point where you should probably stop it
and<00:06:39.509> strain<00:06:39.779> it<00:06:39.930> off<00:06:40.909> you're<00:06:41.909> straining<00:06:42.270> into

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
and strain it off you're straining into

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:51.530 
and strain it off you're straining into
a<00:06:43.020> smaller<00:06:43.439> pot

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.840 

now<00:06:52.540> all<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.990> solids<00:06:53.530> are<00:06:54.100> there<00:06:54.340> at<00:06:54.460> the<00:06:54.610> top

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
now all the solids are there at the top

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.840 
now all the solids are there at the top
of<00:06:55.060> the<00:06:55.150> sieve<00:06:55.510> here<00:06:55.540> or<00:06:56.470> just<00:06:57.280> basically

waste material can stir them around make

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.230 
waste material can stir them around make
sure<00:06:59.950> you<00:07:00.040> get<00:07:00.130> over<00:07:00.370> with<00:07:00.520> what<00:07:00.700> you<00:07:00.790> can<00:07:01.030> off

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
sure you get over with what you can off

they've given up everything they've got
that<00:07:06.670> is<00:07:06.790> trashed

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.070 

once<00:07:15.729> you<00:07:15.819> got<00:07:15.940> it<00:07:16.060> down<00:07:16.270> to<00:07:16.449> about<00:07:16.599> 40<00:07:17.050> degrees

day

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.559 

now<00:07:29.500> the<00:07:29.920> final

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:31.569 
now the final

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:34.049 
now the final
how<00:07:32.229> much<00:07:32.379> meat<00:07:32.619> he<00:07:32.800> had<00:07:32.979> a<00:07:33.009> bunch<00:07:33.309> vegetables

00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:34.059 
how much meat he had a bunch vegetables

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:36.149 
how much meat he had a bunch vegetables
and<00:07:34.389> how<00:07:34.749> much<00:07:34.960> reduced<00:07:35.379> it<00:07:35.649> this<00:07:35.800> is<00:07:35.979> what<00:07:36.129> I

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:36.159 
and how much reduced it this is what I

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.459 
and how much reduced it this is what I
reduced<00:07:36.639> all<00:07:36.879> of<00:07:37.119> this<00:07:37.270> to<00:07:37.569> the<00:07:37.809> reason<00:07:38.289> it's

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:38.469 
reduced all of this to the reason it's

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:40.019 
reduced all of this to the reason it's
so<00:07:38.649> dark<00:07:38.889> is<00:07:39.039> because<00:07:39.339> all<00:07:39.429> those<00:07:39.550> mushrooms

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:40.029 
so dark is because all those mushrooms

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.329 
so dark is because all those mushrooms
that<00:07:40.179> are<00:07:40.240> in<00:07:40.389> there<00:07:40.569> this<00:07:41.289> is<00:07:41.529> a<00:07:41.679> very<00:07:42.069> rich

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:42.339 
that are in there this is a very rich

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:45.029 
that are in there this is a very rich
and<00:07:42.580> powerful<00:07:43.059> taste<00:07:43.749> because<00:07:44.469> I<00:07:44.559> reduced<00:07:44.860> it

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 
and powerful taste because I reduced it

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.799 
and powerful taste because I reduced it
this<00:07:45.159> much<00:07:45.399> this<00:07:45.819> would<00:07:45.999> not<00:07:46.179> be<00:07:46.330> considered<00:07:46.719> a

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:46.809 
this much this would not be considered a

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:48.989 
this much this would not be considered a
general<00:07:47.069> chicken<00:07:48.069> stock<00:07:48.309> this<00:07:48.520> is<00:07:48.669> something

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:48.999 
general chicken stock this is something

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:52.290 
general chicken stock this is something
for<00:07:49.209> an<00:07:49.300> intense<00:07:49.629> flavor<00:07:50.129> but<00:07:51.129> you<00:07:51.969> know<00:07:52.089> it's

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:52.300 
for an intense flavor but you know it's

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.909 
for an intense flavor but you know it's
how<00:07:52.539> much<00:07:52.659> you<00:07:52.719> reduce<00:07:53.110> it<00:07:53.319> how<00:07:53.409> much<00:07:53.589> made<00:07:53.800> you

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 
how much you reduce it how much made you

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.499 
how much you reduce it how much made you
put<00:07:54.099> in<00:07:54.249> what<00:07:54.429> vegetables<00:07:54.939> you<00:07:55.029> couldn't<00:07:55.330> sell
