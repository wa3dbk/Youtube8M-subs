00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 olive tree so today a new 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.029
 video tends so I wanted to you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 do my routine 20 of the moment that is getting 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 still compose a lot of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.700
 new products and that's it I find 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.240
 always interesting to see a little 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 little dyed products of the moment so I 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 will you do my time routine with 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.789
 so what I 'm about pretty much 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 every day with brushes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.050
 I use it all coughs coughed 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 so what has not changed I use 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.480
 still at 46 at the coal and the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 marabout so that is a foundation of complexion 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.300
 but me here I do not put it everywhere 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.040
 before I put it to me but 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 stay over a lot I just apply 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.440
 on the wings of the nose and is actually there 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.020
 where there are the ports mainly for 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 try to slip a little bit after 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 if you're interested I made a demo 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.890
 complete of this product I will put you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.210
 this in info bar 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.100
 you see it's a product that's 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.590
 still pretty transparent there is no 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
 two shades it's universal 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 you just have to find out after that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.289
 Generally speaking, we put something 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.420
 on it does not really know how he 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.229
 love me cream my heart so I would love 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:12.150
 that quickly there so once 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.470
 I did that on the doors or ugly I 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.659
 will apply my anti firm which is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 always the same one here frankly I 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.979
 think he'll never change it's the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.590
 natural ster of gasoline which costs 1 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 euro 79.6 and then back up 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 January 2014 which is very very very good 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.110
 so it comes with a purpose like that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 but I did not care about the ultras often 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 I have the tent that the 2 I think 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 yeah there two softs end so that is 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.820
 very much for them for the winter so I 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190
 come in master hyper generously by 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.910
 there I put a little too generous 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.520
 at the level of terns and I come even 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.420
 go down a little bit on the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:58.970
 edges I also come a master there and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.640
 between the eyebrows in case I was 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.500
 redness actually I do it all I 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 I'm sure and so I kept them 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.170
 personally with a small brush 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.520
 as if brushed by then here 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.840
 when we feel pretty much about that which 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.490
 always a little scared in us 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.170
 agree I'm coming to take my 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.240
 ghost of love of the moment that is fun 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.000
 bike by terry and the complexion delectation 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.400
 that I caught the balance at 22 euros of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.460
 3/5 or so it's just the sphere of 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.620
 century but I do not know if we can 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.290
 find or if you want to 75 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.310
 euros of which 20 years frankly each 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.020
 do what he wants but it's still 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.670
 quite expensive but it is great and so 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.050
 I have expectations number 3 lamielle 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.850
 apricots then with this brush so there 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.390
 jls has a brush with is I 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.650
 you did a review on it so I 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.940
 you would put it by default these are from 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.430
 super super brush that can be found 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.060
 on us ebay that costs nothing at all and 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.640
 which are great 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.340
 so I even thought so much so and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.709
 like that and so I'm going to apply in 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.090
 done in two groups it's good face 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 is fully done so I put it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.970
 directly on the brush I find that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.010
 very very very very handy so he 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.330
 then comes then spread a little bit 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.330
 like that and on the world and on him 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:25.049
 we do the same on the other side for the 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.049
 rest of the face and the bottom 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.770
 on the other hand by not paying attention to the teeth 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.530
 eyebrows because with that actually 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.480
 kind of material on the brushes after 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.840
 you all any eyebrows 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.360
 okay it's not tel I'm going to take 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.780
 my little corrector home michou that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.250
 I introduced you in Korean All 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.739
 I do not know expectations always something 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.959
 if axa that makes it a cream corrector 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.010
 very very very very good god to 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.260
 to hide a little bit of everything 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.069
 perfection it is ultra covering it's 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.750
 a crazy thing 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.959
 so I just want to put you a little 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.170
 little where I have small imperfections 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.170
 to try to hide all this 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.780
 that's when I said 'if you 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 will be able to see but as do so by 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.310
 terry is counting 1 mainly to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.350
 water base that is to say I think it 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.610
 shine a lot here 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.009
 so suddenly to remove this effect a 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.199
 little fat from the foundation I'm going 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.449
 use my powder which clogs more than 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.860
 Catry among which is great I you 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.620
 have already spoken a billion times but 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.440
 really his great product so I 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.139
 the wait 0.15 natural fishing that I have 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.419
 still a lot digging and always 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.660
 with a brush so acted alone 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.080
 so whoever is in trapeze I'm going 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.979
 come in apply generously and she 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.979
 does his job better 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.580
 and that's all for what I 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.750
 do right now for the time me 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.380
 I really like the result I find it 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.350
 very very natural that's not too much and 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.400
 to make a plate must all that lights 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.530
 who apparently had products sound 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.330
 face but I really like the result 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.800
 so it was my little winter weather 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.639
 but that looks like a little bit like 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.490
 autumn I find right now 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.199
 but please do not hesitate to tell me your 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.970
 price of the darling of his moment this 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.840
 revelation in products time it does not 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.370
 I'm still interested 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.460
 so I do lots of kisses and I say to 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.460
