 almost five centimeters thick concrete walls and glass fronts around one 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.190
 the house has cost half a million euros since 2004 the family of four lives

 the euro lost welcome man 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.820
 the cube construction is particularly well visible inside the steel girders 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.560
 The open living space is dominated by a structure that looks simple 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.170
 by no means

 but not only the house is a made to measure 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.870
 also the furniture 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.860
 the kitchen for example Bode made of chipboard David Peace Walker 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.620
 opted for the bright press wood because it is cheap while looking elegant 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.810
