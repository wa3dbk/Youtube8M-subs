00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.049
 hello dear friends this project 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.929
 reform Islam valery gusev 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.429
 Today we will consider with you the theme of kubota 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.619
 repent x there 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 I had this moment 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 it turned out that two types of flashlights 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.730
 this so-called salt melts a 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.680
 his mode is switched 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.240
 directly on the body 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.179
 on the rivers sports switching 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:37.680
 modes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 he thinks he 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.260
 there is a flashlight 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.760
 1 drawback which we'll talk a little 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 later 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.240
 so consider the yellow flashlight 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.200
 the first thing we have to check is it 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200
 expiration date here it is attached 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 but I'm very drunk 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.140
 ultra given flashlight has three 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.300
 regime 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 this is a mode and here is the un 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.010
 f mode 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.290
 and test mode 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.510
 in olton mode when closing contacts 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.580
 light is activated 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.540
 in closing mode 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.900
 nolan daughter is not collecting data 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.580
 mode using your transportation nonsense 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.950
 equipment on board 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 test mode is convenient for 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.600
 flashlight ability checks 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.090
 unesco was 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 light bulb lights up 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.420
 Ukrainian, you noticed that with 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.829
 legal this fermentation is unreal 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.600
 different mirror 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.160
 this is a manufacturer's mistake 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.810
 here is indicated all your contact and clip 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.070
 facial contact is only with 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.290
 one side 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 this position 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 the face snaps on the left and it turns out 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.500
 regime but here's a hand 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.310
 but we are the sinks will bring together the main thing we 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.870
 know how to check it spacious 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.939
 irrelevant 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.639
 flashlight attached to a vest 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.619
 uniform suit he should always 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.439
 be in mode 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.609
 Moreover, it is so when hit 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.849
 contacts year lights up 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.769
 This means that our equipment is ready. 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.769
 using 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.669
 now consider pso flies 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.749
 on his body we see his dates 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.099
 the validity of this flashlight 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.680
 the switch may be just a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.409
 two modes is alcock mode 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.719
 and mode 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.319
 in mode his calls to her contacts 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.650
 the light is not activated and in 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.169
 mode and so 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.189
 closes cantata going 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.159
 i.e. hold flashlight year 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.470
 the light comes on and we come up 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.899
 significant disadvantage of this 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:05.569
 flashlight type that is, it turns out that 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.849
 no offline testing modes 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.590
 in order to test the flashlight you 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.659
 need to let his cars 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.909
 It is very uncomfortable 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.980
 walk the vessel with a glass of water and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.459
 makadi it lanterns agree it's stupid 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.109
 but there is a simple solution to this 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.329
 situations usually take a paper clip 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.379
 schools 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.729
 take out and yahoo 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.369
 we use it to close the contacts and get 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.909
 works another point 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.919
 so you can easily check everything 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.409
 their economies 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.449
 from personal experience I will say that he should 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.739
 make a check 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.290
 flashlight life jackets 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.059
 world costumes 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.139
 at times 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.739
 training alarms every crew member must 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.289
 arrive at the bridge station with the rescue 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.949
 vest not and wetsuit 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.349
 are you quick during the scribes 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.400
 check its performance 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.609
 all charges 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.979
 the remaining lanterns you calm 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.819
 check after hours they 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.949
 distract from the rest of the team members 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.090
 to today we reviewed with you 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.510
 major as long as on the rivers which 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.929
 you can meet on board 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.539
 hereinafter how they work 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.709
 and how to test them 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.479
 but it's all about your choice of gusev to everyone 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.639
 thank
