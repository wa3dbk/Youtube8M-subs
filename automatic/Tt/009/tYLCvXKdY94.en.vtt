now<00:01:48.079> 11<00:01:48.709> weird<00:01:49.009> thing<00:01:49.249> that<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.880> found<00:01:50.209> was<00:01:50.479> that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
now 11 weird thing that I found was that

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.219 
now 11 weird thing that I found was that
the<00:01:51.979> zooms<00:01:52.189> don't<00:01:52.549> stay<00:01:53.209> like<00:01:53.779> the<00:01:54.049> zoom

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the zooms don't stay like the zoom

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.989 
the zooms don't stay like the zoom
doesn't<00:01:54.590> stay<00:01:54.829> zoomed<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.399> have<00:01:55.609> to<00:01:55.759> hold

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
doesn't stay zoomed in you have to hold

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.029 
doesn't stay zoomed in you have to hold
it<00:01:56.149> there<00:01:56.389> so<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:57.259> is<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.560> same<00:01:57.740> if<00:01:57.889> you're

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
it there so this is the same if you're

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.309 
it there so this is the same if you're
looking<00:01:58.310> at<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.700> picture<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.479> diagram<00:02:00.139> or

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
looking at a picture a diagram or

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.550 
looking at a picture a diagram or
something<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.450> zoom<00:02:02.599> in<00:02:02.810> that's<00:02:03.200> fine

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
something you can zoom in that's fine

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.769 
something you can zoom in that's fine
but<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:04.189> doesn't<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.880> doesn't<00:02:04.939> stay<00:02:05.389> there<00:02:05.599> I
