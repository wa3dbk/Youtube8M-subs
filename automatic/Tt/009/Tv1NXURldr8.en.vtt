00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
a brad that you can pull out and what I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.250 
a brad that you can pull out and what I
love<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.060> all<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.630> extra<00:03:02.019> space

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
love about this is all the extra space

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830 
love about this is all the extra space
it<00:03:02.560> gives<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.790> texture<00:03:04.269> cardstock<00:03:04.810> that

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
it gives and this texture cardstock that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.979 
it gives and this texture cardstock that
I<00:03:05.019> used<00:03:05.349> is<00:03:05.700> pretty<00:03:06.700> similar<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.390> both<00:03:07.599> sides

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
I used is pretty similar on both sides

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.229 
I used is pretty similar on both sides
so<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.799> can<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.010> as<00:03:09.280> easily<00:03:09.459> use<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.060> back

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
so you can just as easily use the back

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.849 
so you can just as easily use the back
of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> tags<00:03:10.750> out<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> front<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.709> I'm
