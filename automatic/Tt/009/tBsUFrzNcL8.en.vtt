changes<00:00:24.779> i<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> should<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.890> make

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
changes i think that should really make

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
changes i think that should really make
for<00:00:26.220> some<00:00:26.340> interesting<00:00:26.510> Protoss<00:00:27.510> matchups

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
for some interesting Protoss matchups

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.169 
for some interesting Protoss matchups
now<00:00:28.199> really<00:00:29.039> curious<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.640> PvP

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
now really curious to see how PvP

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
now really curious to see how PvP
unfolds<00:00:30.599> actually<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.170> anyways<00:00:32.009> what

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
unfolds actually and anyways what

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.650 
unfolds actually and anyways what
they've<00:00:32.369> done<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.759> they've<00:00:32.910> extended<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
they've done is they've extended the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.979 
they've done is they've extended the
warp<00:00:33.870> gate<00:00:34.079> research<00:00:34.500> time<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.570> 160<00:00:36.570> seconds

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
warp gate research time to 160 seconds

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.810 
warp gate research time to 160 seconds
it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.410> forty<00:00:37.860> seconds<00:00:38.280> before<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.760> case

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
it was one forty seconds before in case

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
it was one forty seconds before in case
you're<00:00:39.120> wondering<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> mean

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you're wondering so that's going to mean

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
you're wondering so that's going to mean
that<00:00:40.530> four<00:00:40.890> gates<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.430> more<00:00:41.610> delayed

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that four gates are much more delayed

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030 
that four gates are much more delayed
now<00:00:42.180> delayed<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.750> 20<00:00:42.809> seconds<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
now delayed by 20 seconds is actually a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.920 
now delayed by 20 seconds is actually a
pretty<00:00:44.250> big<00:00:44.460> deal<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.969> another<00:00:45.809> thing

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
pretty big deal and another thing

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.029 
pretty big deal and another thing
they've<00:00:46.170> done<00:00:46.200> they've<00:00:46.559> made<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
they've done they've made it so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.270 
they've done they've made it so
centuries<00:00:47.550> train<00:00:48.300> faster<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.020> gateways<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
centuries train faster at gateways so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
centuries train faster at gateways so
it's<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.730> 37<00:00:51.329> seconds<00:00:51.690> instead<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> 42<00:00:52.410> i

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's now 37 seconds instead of 42 i

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.819 
it's now 37 seconds instead of 42 i
believe<00:00:52.800> which<00:00:53.430> means<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> obviously<00:00:54.420> uh

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
believe which means that obviously uh

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.290 
believe which means that obviously uh
products<00:00:55.829> won't<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.250> prone<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> those

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
products won't be as prone to those

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660 
products won't be as prone to those

rushes<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.449> Terrans<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.440> with

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
rushes that Terrans can do with

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
rushes that Terrans can do with
concussive<00:01:01.980> shells<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.030> century<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.510> be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
concussive shells the century will be

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.080 
concussive shells the century will be
out<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> time<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> horse<00:01:04.439> feel<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.860> i<00:01:04.890> think

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
out in time to horse feel that i think

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
out in time to horse feel that i think
so<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.840> change<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.380> think

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so that's a really good change i think

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.810 
so that's a really good change i think
that<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.890> probably<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.460> little<00:01:08.610> bit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that was probably a little bit

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
that was probably a little bit
unbalanced<00:01:09.330> being<00:01:09.689> able<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> push<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.350> there

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
unbalanced being able to push up there

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.340 
unbalanced being able to push up there
so<00:01:10.710> fast<00:01:11.010> especially<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.850> shorter<00:01:12.240> maps<00:01:12.450> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so fast especially on shorter maps but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.870 
so fast especially on shorter maps but
that's<00:01:13.619> probably<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> thing<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that's probably going to be a thing of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030 
that's probably going to be a thing of
the<00:01:14.939> past<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.420> change<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.920> else

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the past with that change and what else

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
the past with that change and what else
did<00:01:17.250> they<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.400> oh<00:01:17.670> yes<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.180> course<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> pylon

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
did they do oh yes of course the pylon

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
did they do oh yes of course the pylon
radius<00:01:19.290> decreased<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.400> 6.5<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.630> 7.5<00:01:22.430> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
radius decreased to 6.5 from 7.5 the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.359 
radius decreased to 6.5 from 7.5 the
power<00:01:23.640> radius<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:26.040> pretty

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
power radius that's I think a pretty

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
power radius that's I think a pretty
good<00:01:26.549> change<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.600> problem<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.439> saw<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
good change on a problem that we saw a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
good change on a problem that we saw a
lot<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.070> Protoss<00:01:29.430> vs<00:01:29.759> protoss<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> four

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
lot in Protoss vs protoss was the four

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
lot in Protoss vs protoss was the four
gating<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.710> warping<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> ramp

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
gating and then warping up the ramp

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
gating and then warping up the ramp
that's<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.079> much<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:35.159> more

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's going to be much much more

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
that's going to be much much more
difficult<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> change<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.350> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
difficult now with that change so for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
difficult now with that change so for
dates<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.460> even<00:01:38.700> further

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
dates are going to be even further

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.780 
dates are going to be even further

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
a ghost is a good change it's going to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.719 
a ghost is a good change it's going to
mean<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.930> those<00:02:01.079> ghosts<00:02:01.590> out

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
mean that you can get those ghosts out

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.950 
mean that you can get those ghosts out
without<00:02:02.729> cutting<00:02:03.000> into<00:02:03.240> your<00:02:03.270> siege<00:02:03.570> tanks

without cutting into your siege tanks

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
without cutting into your siege tanks
too<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.590> cost<00:02:04.920> less<00:02:05.100> gas<00:02:05.399> now

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
too much because they cost less gas now

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 
too much because they cost less gas now
very<00:02:06.420> very<00:02:06.719> important<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.290> terran<00:02:07.860> vs<00:02:08.099> zerg

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
very very important in terran vs zerg

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.969 
very very important in terran vs zerg
because<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> investor<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.379> really

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because of the investor the really

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
because of the investor the really
powerful<00:02:11.160> investors<00:02:11.910> now

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
powerful investors now

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.290 
powerful investors now
which<00:02:12.890> should<00:02:13.430> become<00:02:13.760> less<00:02:13.970> powerful

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
which should become less powerful

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.940 
which should become less powerful
because<00:02:14.630> their<00:02:14.840> speed<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:15.470> reduced<00:02:15.650> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
because their speed is now reduced to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.940 
because their speed is now reduced to
the<00:02:16.280> speed<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.760> marine<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.060> tank<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.650> also

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
the speed of a marine and tank but also

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.760 
the speed of a marine and tank but also
the<00:02:19.700> biggest<00:02:19.910> change<00:02:20.270> with<00:02:20.510> Terran<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.110> think

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the biggest change with Terran I think

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.130 
the biggest change with Terran I think
that's<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.489> impact<00:02:22.880> term<00:02:23.870> vs

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
that's going to really impact term vs

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.620 
that's going to really impact term vs
protoss<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.069> Thor<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.030> Thor<00:02:26.300> now<00:02:26.450> has

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
protoss is the Thor the Thor now has

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.589 
protoss is the Thor the Thor now has
energy<00:02:27.080> again<00:02:27.380> just<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.860> used<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
energy again just like it used to and

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.660 
energy again just like it used to and
250<00:02:29.599> millimeter<00:02:29.989> strike<00:02:30.349> can<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.739> costs<00:02:30.920> 150

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
250 millimeter strike can and costs 150

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.930 
250 millimeter strike can and costs 150
energy<00:02:31.970> meaning<00:02:32.269> it's<00:02:32.480> almost<00:02:32.690> useless<00:02:32.959> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
energy meaning it's almost useless and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.729 
energy meaning it's almost useless and
you<00:02:34.940> know<00:02:35.030> thoughts<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.510> now<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.750> feedback<00:02:36.410> to

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
you know thoughts can now be feedback to

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.309 
you know thoughts can now be feedback to
get<00:02:37.130> rid<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.540> pretty<00:02:38.540> much<00:02:38.720> half<00:02:38.930> their<00:02:39.140> health

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
get rid of pretty much half their health

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.710 
get rid of pretty much half their health
so<00:02:39.680> that's<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.280> fantastic<00:02:42.099> 300<00:02:43.099> 200<00:02:44.030> cost

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
so that's just fantastic 300 200 cost

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.530 
so that's just fantastic 300 200 cost
for<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.110> Thor<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.519> can<00:02:46.640> be<00:02:46.670> taken<00:02:47.420> out

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
for that Thor and it can be taken out

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.630 
for that Thor and it can be taken out
with<00:02:47.810> one<00:02:48.019> feedback<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:48.680> costs<00:02:48.890> 50<00:02:49.280> energy

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
with one feedback that costs 50 energy

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.360 
with one feedback that costs 50 energy
that's<00:02:49.790> just<00:02:50.060> fantastic<00:02:50.299> blizzard<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.380> really

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
that's just fantastic blizzard I really

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's just fantastic blizzard I really
don't<00:02:52.459> understand<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.180> change<00:02:53.360> because

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160

don't understand that change because

well<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:56.959> what<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.739> must<00:02:58.010> have<00:02:58.160> been

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
well but what I think it must have been

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.039 
well but what I think it must have been
some<00:02:58.430> abuse<00:02:58.760> somewhere<00:02:59.150> if<00:02:59.330> maybe<00:02:59.690> someone

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
some abuse somewhere if maybe someone

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.500 
some abuse somewhere if maybe someone
can<00:03:00.170> correct<00:03:01.160> me<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.819> I'm<00:03:02.030> wrong<00:03:02.239> there

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
can correct me here I if I'm wrong there

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.360 
can correct me here I if I'm wrong there
must<00:03:02.690> be<00:03:02.810> some<00:03:03.019> abuse<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.860> was<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.069> on

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
must be some abuse that was going on

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.860 
must be some abuse that was going on
with<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.580> Thor's<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.090> led<00:03:05.299> them<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
with the Thor's that led them to do this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.420 
with the Thor's that led them to do this
because<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.590> really<00:03:06.620> seems<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.400> just

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
because it really seems like it just

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.170 
because it really seems like it just

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
game you geez what a tangent I'm just

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.289 
game you geez what a tangent I'm just
going<00:03:34.069> up<00:03:34.160> for<00:03:34.310> some<00:03:34.430> tech<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.819> want<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.060> see<00:03:35.180> how

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
going up for some tech I want to see how

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.330 
going up for some tech I want to see how
tech<00:03:35.600> unfolds<00:03:36.109> now<00:03:36.260> vs<00:03:36.620> protoss<00:03:36.950> simply

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
tech unfolds now vs protoss simply

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.900 
tech unfolds now vs protoss simply
because<00:03:37.959> well<00:03:38.959> i<00:03:39.170> think<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:40.160> with<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.489> new

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
because well i think that with this new

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.170 
because well i think that with this new
warp<00:03:41.389> gate<00:03:41.569> research<00:03:41.930> time<00:03:42.200> being<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.709> long

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
warp gate research time being so long

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.370 
warp gate research time being so long
you're<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.329> be<00:03:44.420> able<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.690> tech<00:03:44.870> faster

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
you're going to be able to tech faster

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.900 
you're going to be able to tech faster
without<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.769> much<00:03:45.889> risk<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.549> i'm<00:03:46.639> going<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:46.790> be

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
without as much risk so i'm going to be

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.819 
without as much risk so i'm going to be
trying<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:47.480> with<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> 111<00:03:48.440> build<00:03:48.680> as

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
trying that here with the 111 build as

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.890 
trying that here with the 111 build as
you<00:03:48.920> can<00:03:49.069> see<00:03:49.280> my<00:03:50.060> favorite<00:03:50.299> build<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.780> do<00:03:50.870> i

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you can see my favorite build to do i

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.509 
you can see my favorite build to do i
think<00:03:51.230> it's<00:03:51.350> really<00:03:51.650> good<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.100> map<00:03:52.340> as

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
think it's really good on this map as

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.460 
think it's really good on this map as
well<00:03:52.549> because<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.030> those<00:03:53.209> rocks<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.290> left

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
well because of those rocks on the left

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.809 
well because of those rocks on the left
side<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.709> can<00:03:54.920> push<00:03:55.160> through<00:03:55.370> them<00:03:55.519> just<00:03:55.700> like

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
side you can push through them just like

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.210 
side you can push through them just like
you<00:03:55.910> code<00:03:56.120> on<00:03:56.209> Shakira's<00:03:56.540> plateau<00:03:57.220> before

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
you code on Shakira's plateau before

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.490 
you code on Shakira's plateau before
they<00:03:58.370> change<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.970> map<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.600> it's<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.290> really

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
they change the map and it's a really

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.970 
they change the map and it's a really
powerful<00:04:00.769> push<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:02.359> yeah<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.739> only<00:04:03.829> thing

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
powerful push and yeah the only thing

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.309 
powerful push and yeah the only thing
that's<00:04:04.519> different<00:04:04.700> here<00:04:05.090> however<00:04:05.810> from

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
that's different here however from

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.840 
that's different here however from
shakura<00:04:06.799> splat<00:04:07.130> oh<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.609> on<00:04:07.700> should

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
shakura splat oh is that on should

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.190 
shakura splat oh is that on should
correspond<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:08.359> you<00:04:08.450> could<00:04:08.600> easily<00:04:08.690> easily

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
correspond so you could easily easily

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.160 
correspond so you could easily easily
wall<00:04:09.709> off<00:04:09.889> your<00:04:10.100> natural<00:04:10.430> here<00:04:11.389> not<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:11.930> much

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
wall off your natural here not so much

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.960 
wall off your natural here not so much
you<00:04:12.350> can't<00:04:12.590> do<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:14.420> pose<00:04:14.840> sorry<00:04:15.739> you

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
you can't do that so you pose sorry you

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.150 
you can't do that so you pose sorry you
basically<00:04:17.079> risk<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.260> lot<00:04:18.440> more<00:04:18.680> by<00:04:18.859> pushing

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
basically risk a lot more by pushing

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.469 
basically risk a lot more by pushing
through<00:04:19.430> there<00:04:19.579> because<00:04:19.729> then<00:04:19.910> your<00:04:20.060> main<00:04:20.239> is

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
through there because then your main is

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.840 
through there because then your main is
completely<00:04:21.019> undefended

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
completely undefended

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.820 
completely undefended
whereas<00:04:22.540> I'm<00:04:22.660> she<00:04:22.810> curse<00:04:22.990> plateau<00:04:23.350> obviously

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
whereas I'm she curse plateau obviously

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.240 
whereas I'm she curse plateau obviously
you<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.580> made<00:04:25.420> that<00:04:25.470> rocket<00:04:26.470> area<00:04:26.950> your<00:04:27.160> new

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
you just made that rocket area your new

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.690

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
also going to be adding a second

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.170 
also going to be adding a second
barracks<00:04:48.160> here<00:04:48.340> instead<00:04:48.670> of<00:04:48.790> adding<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
barracks here instead of adding a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.600 
barracks here instead of adding a
command<00:04:49.510> center<00:04:49.600> just<00:04:50.080> because<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.580> new

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
command center just because it's a new

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.600 
command center just because it's a new
patch<00:04:51.910> don't<00:04:52.750> feel<00:04:52.960> quite<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:53.500> safe<00:04:53.740> yet<00:04:54.010> one

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
patch don't feel quite so safe yet one

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.100 
patch don't feel quite so safe yet one
have<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:54.850> bit<00:04:55.030> more<00:04:55.180> units<00:04:55.570> before<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:55.900> go<00:04:56.080> out

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
have a bit more units before I go out

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.650 
have a bit more units before I go out
there<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.410> expand<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.360> yeah<00:04:58.360> we're<00:04:58.480> going<00:04:58.600> to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
there and expand so yeah we're going to

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.050 
there and expand so yeah we're going to
have<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.080> see<00:04:59.200> how<00:04:59.260> that<00:04:59.410> goes<00:04:59.440> and<00:05:00.060> obviously

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
have to see how that goes and obviously

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.120 
have to see how that goes and obviously
he's<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.420> Protoss<00:05:01.840> player<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.320> he's<00:05:02.410> random<00:05:02.920> so

he's a Protoss player and he's random so

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.160 
he's a Protoss player and he's random so
I'm<00:05:03.220> very<00:05:03.250> very<00:05:04.090> on<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.480> lookout<00:05:04.690> for<00:05:04.750> cheese

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
I'm very very on the lookout for cheese

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.340 
I'm very very on the lookout for cheese
because<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:06.790> know<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:07.120> I'm<00:05:07.450> sorry<00:05:08.140> didn't

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
because you know what I'm sorry didn't

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.690 
because you know what I'm sorry didn't
you<00:05:08.440> random<00:05:08.800> players<00:05:09.010> up<00:05:09.160> there<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.340> don't<00:05:09.580> want

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
you random players up there I don't want

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.250 
you random players up there I don't want
to<00:05:09.760> generalize<00:05:10.030> but<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.570> lot<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:10.960> random

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
to generalize but a lot of random

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.380 
to generalize but a lot of random
players<00:05:11.560> do<00:05:11.740> cheese's<00:05:12.220> because<00:05:12.610> they're<00:05:13.270> not

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
players do cheese's because they're not

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.230 
players do cheese's because they're not
as<00:05:13.540> familiar<00:05:13.720> with<00:05:14.050> each<00:05:14.350> race<00:05:14.650> as<00:05:15.240> someone

as familiar with each race as someone
who<00:05:16.330> plays<00:05:16.450> only<00:05:16.750> one<00:05:17.020> race<00:05:17.230> would<00:05:17.410> be<00:05:17.560> so

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
who plays only one race would be so

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.140 
who plays only one race would be so
they're<00:05:17.920> just<00:05:18.070> not<00:05:18.250> as<00:05:18.370> good<00:05:18.550> at<00:05:18.670> Macaroni

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
they're just not as good at Macaroni

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.030 
they're just not as good at Macaroni
with<00:05:19.390> all<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.170> races<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.620> they<00:05:20.800> are<00:05:20.860> gonna

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
with all the races that they are gonna

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.340 
with all the races that they are gonna
you<00:05:21.580> know<00:05:21.700> do<00:05:21.850> a<00:05:21.880> few<00:05:22.060> more<00:05:22.180> cheeses<00:05:22.600> then<00:05:23.170> you

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
you know do a few more cheeses then you

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.470 
you know do a few more cheeses then you
normally<00:05:23.500> see<00:05:23.950> from<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:26.170> you<00:05:26.470> know<00:05:26.590> a

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
normally see from just you know a

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.600 
normally see from just you know a
committed<00:05:28.480> players<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.930> each<00:05:29.050> race<00:05:29.610> so

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
committed players of each race so

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.920 
committed players of each race so
anyways<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.030> bench<00:05:31.210> he's<00:05:31.360> not<00:05:31.510> going<00:05:31.810> over

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
anyways the bench he's not going over

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.570 
anyways the bench he's not going over
there<00:05:32.170> I<00:05:32.350> like<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:32.860> also<00:05:33.130> because<00:05:33.310> we're<00:05:33.490> in

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
there I like it also because we're in

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.700 
there I like it also because we're in
close<00:05:33.970> spots<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:34.930> i<00:05:34.960> can<00:05:35.260> get<00:05:35.380> over<00:05:35.590> there

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
close spots so i can get over there

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.140 
close spots so i can get over there
pretty<00:05:35.890> easily<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> first<00:05:36.760> thing<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.000> look

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
pretty easily and the first thing I look

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.210 
pretty easily and the first thing I look
for<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.450> the<00:05:37.720> expansion<00:05:38.080> which<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.560> not<00:05:38.920> there

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
for is the expansion which is not there

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.670 
for is the expansion which is not there
if<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:40.240> see<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.480> Protoss<00:05:40.870> with<00:05:41.020> an<00:05:41.110> expo<00:05:41.560> at

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
if you see a Protoss with an expo at

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.770 
if you see a Protoss with an expo at
this<00:05:41.830> point<00:05:42.190> be<00:05:42.730> prepared<00:05:42.940> for<00:05:43.330> an<00:05:43.420> all-in

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
this point be prepared for an all-in

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.330 
this point be prepared for an all-in
because<00:05:44.080> that's<00:05:44.260> probably<00:05:44.860> what<00:05:45.070> he's<00:05:45.190> going

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
because that's probably what he's going

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.590 
because that's probably what he's going
to<00:05:45.430> be<00:05:45.520> doing<00:05:45.640> and<00:05:45.910> as<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.120> can<00:05:46.240> see<00:05:46.270> there's

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
to be doing and as you can see there's

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.720 
to be doing and as you can see there's
the<00:05:46.720> for<00:05:46.930> warp<00:05:47.200> gates<00:05:47.440> there's<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.370> nexus

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
the for warp gates there's the nexus

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.940 
the for warp gates there's the nexus
with<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.940> crapload<00:05:49.390> of<00:05:49.630> chrono<00:05:49.990> boost<00:05:50.260> and<00:05:50.470> I'm

it's<00:06:01.150> pretty<00:06:01.480> good<00:06:01.630> as<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:02.560> can<00:06:02.680> see<00:06:02.860> he's

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
it's pretty good as you can see he's

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.920 
it's pretty good as you can see he's

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
hitting at six minutes so he's either

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.480 
hitting at six minutes so he's either
absolutely<00:06:14.260> terrible<00:06:14.650> or<00:06:14.950> this<00:06:15.130> is<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> new

firsthand but anyways as you can see
even<00:06:20.680> though<00:06:20.950> I've<00:06:21.070> tech<00:06:21.310> really<00:06:21.700> hard<00:06:21.910> with

he's<00:06:28.990> just<00:06:29.200> gonna<00:06:29.320> rage<00:06:29.710> quit<00:06:29.950> out<00:06:30.040> of<00:06:30.070> here

he's just gonna rage quit out of here
and<00:06:30.400> there<00:06:30.550> he<00:06:30.610> goes<00:06:30.790> so<00:06:31.330> that's<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.570> new<00:06:31.780> warp

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.420 
and there he goes so that's the new warp
gate<00:06:32.260> rush<00:06:32.470> obviously<00:06:33.010> I<00:06:33.040> know<00:06:33.130> this<00:06:33.250> isn't

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
gate rush obviously I know this isn't

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.090 
gate rush obviously I know this isn't
the<00:06:33.610> probably<00:06:34.420> the<00:06:34.510> best<00:06:34.750> episode<00:06:35.590> ever<00:06:35.740> but<00:06:36.070> I

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
the probably the best episode ever but I

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.650 
the probably the best episode ever but I
do<00:06:36.220> want<00:06:36.580> to<00:06:36.640> show<00:06:36.850> this<00:06:37.060> because<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:37.510> just

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
do want to show this because it just

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.130 
do want to show this because it just
goes<00:06:38.170> to<00:06:38.670> demonstrate<00:06:39.670> that<00:06:40.330> checking<00:06:40.900> out

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
goes to demonstrate that checking out

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.140 
goes to demonstrate that checking out
really<00:06:41.500> hard<00:06:41.680> against<00:06:41.950> protoss<00:06:42.310> now<00:06:42.580> is

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
really hard against protoss now is

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.910 
really hard against protoss now is
actually<00:06:43.360> kind<00:06:43.720> of<00:06:43.750> viable<00:06:44.230> the<00:06:44.380> for<00:06:44.620> warp

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
actually kind of viable the for warp

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.010 
actually kind of viable the for warp
gate<00:06:45.130> rush<00:06:45.280> is<00:06:45.490> just<00:06:45.790> not<00:06:46.540> as<00:06:46.720> good<00:06:46.810> anymore

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
gate rush is just not as good anymore

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.870 
gate rush is just not as good anymore
it's<00:06:47.440> probably<00:06:47.800> not<00:06:47.980> going<00:06:48.100> to<00:06:48.160> punish<00:06:48.340> you<00:06:48.520> as

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
it's probably not going to punish you as

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.940 
it's probably not going to punish you as
hard<00:06:49.480> as<00:06:49.540> it<00:06:49.630> used<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:49.930> annoy<00:06:50.170> that<00:06:50.320> masters<00:06:50.830> in

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
hard as it used to annoy that masters in

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.410 
hard as it used to annoy that masters in
