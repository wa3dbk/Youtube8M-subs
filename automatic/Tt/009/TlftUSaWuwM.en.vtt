00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and I think we can just improve way more

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.140 
and I think we can just improve way more
know<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.560> good<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:28.980> us<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
have a lot of stuff to learn still and

have you felt about the fact that you've

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
have you felt about the fact that you've
got<00:00:44.550> pushed<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.390> gambit<00:00:45.780> got

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
got pushed a little bit by gambit got

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
got pushed a little bit by gambit got
pushed<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.320> little<00:00:46.440> bit<00:00:46.649> by<00:00:46.770> giants<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.340> pushed

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
pushed a little bit by giants got pushed

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
pushed a little bit by giants got pushed
here<00:00:47.789> by<00:00:47.910> og<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.079> why<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> think

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
here by og in this one why do you think

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
here by og in this one why do you think
that<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> um<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:52.879> think<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.780> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that is um I think it's because like we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
that is um I think it's because like we
don't<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.469> usually<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> get

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
don't like usually if you want to get

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.930 
don't like usually if you want to get
early<00:00:57.030> ahead<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.989> should<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.500> risk

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
early ahead you should take some risk

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.580 
early ahead you should take some risk
there<00:00:59.940> must<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.420> risk<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.230> don't

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there must be some risk but we don't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.740 
there must be some risk but we don't
really<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> take<00:01:02.219> risk<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.539> ahead

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
really want to take risk to get ahead

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.340 
really want to take risk to get ahead
like<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:05.180> like<00:01:06.180> equal<00:01:06.570> 554

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
like if we just go like like equal 554

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
like if we just go like like equal 554
early<00:01:07.770> game<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.549> be

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
early game then we can actually be

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.539 
early game then we can actually be
really<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.750> better<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> teamfight<00:01:10.530> waiting<00:01:11.100> as

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really a better a teamfight waiting as

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.740 
really a better a teamfight waiting as
ourselves<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:13.909> like<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.090> tried<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
ourselves and then like like we tried to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140 
ourselves and then like like we tried to
fight<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.259> our<00:01:16.500> power<00:01:16.740> spike<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.939> if

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
fight when our power spike is so like if

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.800 
fight when our power spike is so like if
we<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.680> find<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.820> reason<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> fight

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
we don't really find a reason to fight

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
we don't really find a reason to fight
when<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.189> power<00:01:23.340> spike<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
when we when we have no power spike so I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
when we when we have no power spike so I
think<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.420> because<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.049> let<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.409> take

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
think it's because of like let me take

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.880 
think it's because of like let me take
some<00:01:26.340> risk<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.790> sometimes<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.299> works<00:01:27.890> but

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
some risk but sometimes it works but

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
some risk but sometimes it works but
sometimes<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> doesn't<00:01:29.670> work<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
sometimes it doesn't work so it's like I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.020 
sometimes it doesn't work so it's like I
think<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.780> mainly<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.030> one

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
think it's mainly because of that one

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
think it's mainly because of that one
thing<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.689> had<00:01:34.140> she<00:01:34.409> pee<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> desk

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
thing that we had she pee on the desk

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
thing that we had she pee on the desk
before<00:01:35.460> talking<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.420> shark<00:01:36.810> calling<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
before talking about shark calling a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
before talking about shark calling a
yellow<00:01:37.860> star<00:01:38.130> previously<00:01:38.970> you've<00:01:39.240> had<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> lot

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
yellow star previously you've had a lot

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
yellow star previously you've had a lot
of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> input<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.320> shark<00:01:40.619> culling<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of the input on shark culling is that

of the input on shark culling is that

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
lineup now with this far into the split
and<00:01:45.090> pretty<00:01:45.450> much<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> comes<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> map

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and pretty much when it comes to the map

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
and pretty much when it comes to the map
control<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> movement<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.990> stuff<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
control to the movement and stuff I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.639 
control to the movement and stuff I
mainly<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:51.060> everyone<00:01:51.750> has<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.170> take

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
mainly do it but everyone has to take

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
mainly do it but everyone has to take
part<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.280> process<00:01:54.090> because<00:01:54.600> everyone

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
part in this process because everyone

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
part in this process because everyone
has<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.259> fit<00:01:55.409> information<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.850> whole

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
has to fit information and it's a whole

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
has to fit information and it's a whole
thing<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> work<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.380> complex

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thing to work on and it's really complex

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.459 
thing to work on and it's really complex
but<00:01:59.729> yeah<00:02:00.180> mainly<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.810> comes<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but yeah mainly when it comes to the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.789 
but yeah mainly when it comes to the
team<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.460> mainly<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.450> most<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> alright

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
let's take a look at two instances of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.670 
let's take a look at two instances of
shop<00:02:06.659> calling<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.200> game<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
shop calling in this game and get the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.290 
shop calling in this game and get the
first<00:02:07.890> replay<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> screen<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.060> not

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
first replay up on the screen it's not

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
first replay up on the screen it's not
that<00:02:09.509> favorable<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> guys<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
thought it'd be interesting to get your

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.320 
thought it'd be interesting to get your
perspective

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
perspective

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.820 
perspective

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and you guys can run us through that one

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.600 
and you guys can run us through that one
ok<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:17.200> nu<00:02:17.470> nu<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.710> touching<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.100> pit<00:02:18.340> but

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
ok so now nu nu is touching the pit but

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.640 
ok so now nu nu is touching the pit but
we<00:02:19.060> see<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.690> go<00:02:19.870> back<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.230> forth<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
we see that we go back and forth and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.810 
we see that we go back and forth and
they<00:02:20.770> don't<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.130> want<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.460> come<00:02:21.670> because

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
they don't really want to come because

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.240 
they don't really want to come because
if<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.240> come<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.290> more<00:02:23.320> HP<00:02:23.620> but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
if they come we have way more HP but

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.800 
if they come we have way more HP but
then<00:02:24.430> we<00:02:24.640> see<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.820> Christ<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.270> entering<00:02:25.600> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
then we see that Christ is entering the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
then we see that Christ is entering the
pit<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.140> then<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> starts<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.740> be<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> bit

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
pit and then it starts to be a bit

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.250 
pit and then it starts to be a bit
dangerous<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:28.180> don't<00:02:28.300> want<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.690> spit<00:02:29.080> like

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
dangerous and we don't want to spit like

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
dangerous and we don't want to spit like
this<00:02:29.470> because<00:02:29.680> our<00:02:29.950> team<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.430> more<00:02:30.700> based<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.270> a

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
this because our team is more based as a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.520 
this because our team is more based as a
whole<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.020> our<00:02:32.950> main<00:02:33.310> damage<00:02:33.550> source<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.690> just

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
whole and our main damage source is just

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
whole and our main damage source is just
blown<00:02:35.740> up<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.130> then<00:02:36.220> now<00:02:36.550> we<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.660> run

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
blown up and then now we just just run

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.410 
blown up and then now we just just run
as<00:02:38.170> ice<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:38.890> from<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.490> point<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:40.390> just

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
as ice and then from that point we just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.060 
as ice and then from that point we just
talk<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.080> how<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.470> want<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.770> fight<00:02:41.980> because

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
talk about how we want to fight because

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.980 
talk about how we want to fight because
we've<00:02:42.370> done<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.580> mistake<00:02:42.880> they<00:02:43.300> took<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> barn

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
we've done a mistake they took the barn

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.470 
we've done a mistake they took the barn
so<00:02:44.230> they<00:02:44.350> capitalized<00:02:44.920> really<00:02:45.160> well<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.520> we

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
so they capitalized really well and we

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.730 
so they capitalized really well and we
were<00:02:46.630> talking<00:02:46.810> about<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.140> fight<00:02:47.320> how<00:02:47.440> we<00:02:47.500> want

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
to fight and we know that the further we

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.130 
to fight and we know that the further we
go<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.770> batter<00:02:50.920> will<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.090> even<00:02:52.990> though

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
go and the batter will be so even though

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.170

so<00:04:09.069> previously<00:04:09.580> we've<00:04:10.000> told<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.420> we<00:04:10.569> are

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
so previously we've told that we are

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.509 
so previously we've told that we are
just<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.140> stick<00:04:11.290> together<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.010> will

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
just have to stick together so I will

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.860 
just have to stick together so I will
have<00:04:12.550> no<00:04:12.790> vision<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:13.299> have<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.510> face<00:04:13.629> check

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
have no vision so we have to face check

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.809 
have no vision so we have to face check
so<00:04:13.989> it's<00:04:14.379> really<00:04:14.500> good<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:14.769> Vicki<00:04:15.099> is<00:04:15.250> using

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
source of damage is still alive and then

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.230 
source of damage is still alive and then
she<00:04:29.199> can<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.380> go<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:29.889> Fabian<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:30.970> just

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
she can just go in and Fabian is just

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.510 
she can just go in and Fabian is just
full<00:04:31.419> HP<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.139> can<00:04:32.320> go<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.650> they<00:04:33.190> have<00:04:33.340> no

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
full HP and we can go in they have no

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
flashes we have the movement speed and

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.969 
flashes we have the movement speed and
then<00:04:35.889> from<00:04:36.130> there<00:04:37.290> after<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.410> ice<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.740> think

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
then from there after the ice I think

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.320 
then from there after the ice I think
that<00:04:39.160> there<00:04:39.370> was<00:04:39.610> no<00:04:39.760> way<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:39.940> they<00:04:40.210> could

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
that there was no way that they could

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.270 
that there was no way that they could
come<00:04:40.540> back<00:04:40.660> no<00:04:41.169> definitely<00:04:41.680> not<00:04:41.919> you<00:04:42.100> guys

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
just absolutely steamrolled it since

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.020 
just absolutely steamrolled it since
that<00:04:44.770> moment<00:04:44.979> actually<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.550> was<00:04:45.639> quite<00:04:45.760> funny

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that moment actually it was quite funny

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.700 
that moment actually it was quite funny
to<00:04:46.090> me<00:04:46.389> because<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.810> course<00:04:47.020> picking<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.500> there

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
to me because of course picking in there

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.379 
to me because of course picking in there
a<00:04:47.740> little<00:04:48.010> bit<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.340> back<00:04:48.520> dooring<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.240> then

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
a little bit of back dooring and then
