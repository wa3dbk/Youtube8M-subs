to fold the wings in you take this piece

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
to fold the wings in you take this piece
here<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.539> this<00:00:51.539> gets<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.110> pull<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> down

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
like that and then you're holding down

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.319 
like that and then you're holding down
like<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.190> ready<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.610> very

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
like that so you're ready to go very

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
like that so you're ready to go very
similar<00:00:57.870> transformation<00:00:58.230> process<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
similar transformation process as it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.349 
similar transformation process as it
should<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.500> if<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.460> chest

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
should be and if we look at the chest

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.050 
should be and if we look at the chest
area<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.019> they're<00:01:05.060> remarkably

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
area you can see they're remarkably

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.830 
area you can see they're remarkably
similar<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.840> far<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> overall<00:01:09.420> design

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
similar as far as the the overall design

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
similar as far as the the overall design
I<00:01:09.869> mean<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.200> differences<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.830> course<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I mean there's differences of course but

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.969 
I mean there's differences of course but
the<00:01:12.350> point<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.409> trying<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.799> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the point I'm trying to make is that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.560 
the point I'm trying to make is that
with<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.180> GQ<00:01:16.140> kit<00:01:16.790> it's<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> very

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
with this GQ kit it's going to be very

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.660 
with this GQ kit it's going to be very
intuitive<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.070> together<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
intuitive if you if you put together the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.030 
intuitive if you if you put together the
one<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> 100<00:01:21.299> kit<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.470> let's<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.740> ahead<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> do

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
one to 100 kit so let's go ahead and do

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.240 
one to 100 kit so let's go ahead and do
that<00:01:23.070> we'll<00:01:23.970> take<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> 100<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that we'll take the one to 100 here and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.800 
that we'll take the one to 100 here and
we'll<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.250> insertion<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.810> course

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
we'll do the insertion of the course

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.710 
we'll do the insertion of the course
blender<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> transform<00:01:31.829> course<00:01:32.070> wonder<00:01:32.720> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
blender the transform course wonder you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.539 
blender the transform course wonder you
got<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.970> go<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> GQ<00:01:36.960> kit

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and we'll go ahead and take the course

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
and we'll go ahead and take the course
lender

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.149 

and<00:01:47.979> insert<00:01:48.609> it<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:48.909> that<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.890> can<00:01:50.979> see

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
and insert it like that so you can see

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.169 
and insert it like that so you can see
the<00:01:51.250> similarities<00:01:51.880> at<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.149> point<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:57.179> next

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
the similarities at this point so next

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.929 
the similarities at this point so next
up<00:01:58.359> with<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.780> model<00:01:59.079> kit<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.649> 1<00:01:59.799> 1<00:02:00.219> to<00:02:00.250> 100<00:02:00.789> is

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
up with the model kit the 1 1 to 100 is

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.410 
up with the model kit the 1 1 to 100 is
just<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:02.109> slide<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.630> Gundam<00:02:05.049> over<00:02:05.770> there

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
just a slide the the Gundam over there

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.779 
just a slide the the Gundam over there
and<00:02:07.709> there<00:02:08.709> we<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> two<00:02:09.220> halves<00:02:09.429> joined

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
and there we have a two halves joined

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.860 
and there we have a two halves joined
with<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> 1<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.299> 100<00:02:10.720> kit<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:13.360> we'll<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
with a 1 to 100 kit and we'll do the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.710
