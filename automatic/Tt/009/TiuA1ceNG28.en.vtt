00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.380 

let's<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.640> happens<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.180> messed

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
let's see what happens if he messed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
let's see what happens if he messed
around<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.690> player<00:01:10.020> support<00:01:10.410> maybe<00:01:11.250> towards

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
around with player support maybe towards

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
around with player support maybe towards
100<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.300> is<00:01:12.330> Max<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> players<00:01:13.200> will

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
100 which is Max and the players will

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
100 which is Max and the players will
move<00:01:13.530> their<00:01:13.680> head<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> man<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.220> possession

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
move their head of the man in possession

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.880 
move their head of the man in possession
when<00:01:14.850> waiting<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> ball<00:01:15.680> move<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.800> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
when waiting for the ball move it to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
when waiting for the ball move it to
zero<00:01:17.160> and<00:01:17.460> they'll<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.910> bit<00:01:18.000> drop<00:01:18.300> back

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
zero and they'll a little bit drop back

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.149 
zero and they'll a little bit drop back
behind<00:01:18.630> him

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.270 

you<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:24.999> it<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.869> 290<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.590> players<00:01:26.829> overtake

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
you see it so 290 and players overtake

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.620 
you see it so 290 and players overtake
the<00:01:27.429> man<00:01:27.549> in<00:01:27.670> possession<00:01:27.819> to<00:01:28.210> receive<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.910 
ball further upfield tactical changes
take<00:01:31.299> effect<00:01:31.329> immediately<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.799> is

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
take effect immediately and that is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:43.890 
take effect immediately and that is
something<00:01:33.100> we<00:01:33.340> work<00:01:33.520> very<00:01:33.549> hard<00:01:33.909> on

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.300 

ok<00:01:44.900> this<00:01:45.050> time<00:01:45.260> let's<00:01:45.680> see<00:01:45.800> what<00:01:45.920> happens<00:01:46.220> if

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
ok this time let's see what happens if

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.370 
ok this time let's see what happens if
we<00:01:46.430> adjust<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.850> support<00:01:47.180> range<00:01:47.420> push<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.290> up

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
we adjust the support range push it up

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.200 
we adjust the support range push it up
to<00:01:48.409> 100<00:01:48.979> and<00:01:49.159> players<00:01:49.370> provide<00:01:49.790> personal

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.330 
to 100 and players provide personal
support<00:01:50.650> good<00:01:51.650> if<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.830> like<00:01:51.950> playing<00:01:52.190> your

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
support good if you like playing your

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.730 
support good if you like playing your
short<00:01:52.520> passes<00:01:52.970> push<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.810> towards<00:01:54.050> zero<00:01:54.260> and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
short passes push it towards zero and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.970 
short passes push it towards zero and
the<00:01:54.830> player<00:01:55.040> spread<00:01:55.400> out

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.610 

we<00:02:02.580> set<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.940> 10<00:02:03.150> this<00:02:03.300> time<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.260> seems<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
we set to 10 this time it seems the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.990 
we set to 10 this time it seems the
perfect<00:02:04.770> length<00:02:05.160> for<00:02:05.250> playing<00:02:05.550> long<00:02:05.730> balls

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
perfect length for playing long balls

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
perfect length for playing long balls
but<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.510> can<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.870> it<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.650> isn't<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.980> set
