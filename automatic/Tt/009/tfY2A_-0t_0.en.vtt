00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello this is the most improvised video 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.609
 what have I done in my life actually 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.859
 I'm cooking and it occurred to me to record 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.019
 a video that they asked me that this is about 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.910
 show what's inside my backpack 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.000
 I honestly can not find the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.980
 funny or interesting to this but I 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.770
 I have always considered myself very doraemon 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 to bring things in my backpack so 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.420
 Like we can not bring let 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 split by the big pocket starting 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.779
 for a hat I always do not know why but 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.929
 I always walk with a knife mail 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.719
 a perfume and its on one never 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.920
 he knows when things are bursting 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.469
 feminine and here begins in things 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 useless I do not know why I 'm bringing 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.090
 here because I know that he does not help me 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.420
 nothing charmed the keys of the padlock is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 a part of a charger but it is bad 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.989
 I do not know why when you get a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 Keychain that has no keys are 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 very many but they do not have keys so 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 I do not know why I do it with hearing aids 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.789
 I do not know why I bring them because 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.399
 I do not have a cell phone with music samples 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.589

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.939
 fabric that was part of some slippers 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.979
 mine and I do not know why they're here in 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.710
 because it does not serve more free samples 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.549
 Band-Aid 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.040
 a lipstick that does not look too bad 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.500
 or it is dry it has nothing so 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.290

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.810
