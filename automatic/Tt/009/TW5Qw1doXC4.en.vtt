00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.230
 hello guys in this video I wanted to say 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.420
 that the headlights and commentaries have come off 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 so I leave a lot of the clan stuff 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 the whole of the next world 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.619
 guys , I told you how you did it 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:34.629
 as it's not nice because we're back 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:38.079
 with nuclear pdv 55 75 72 79 wind 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.079
 500 second 75 57 however as you see 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.280
 already bloody because the two products 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.980
 because we believe in its turn alone it is 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.630
 the maximum with around and so we are here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.930
 however play boss for what 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.780
 21 Jan speaks the boss dash 9 so 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.340
 talk about the third person let's say 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.489
 immediately that if you see him stop in 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.149
 this noble was lost is the importance of 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.600
 being well aware as you see you do not know 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.790
 if you see it because it is not pressed series 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.950
 even maybe dinner, but give us, of course 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.299
 I had four notches and all away 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.759
 others to and I repeat in this game 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.579
 I type if you don't see it but I have it 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.279
 me too and the type was sampled for 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.709
 make her a killer as a lion miter 

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:26.249
 because he did type called 22 times 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.569
 fight against the shanghai dog where apart 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.469
 for a long time, you are the 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:35.210
 praise that where it is done now that I have 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.310
 bought reflection market all 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.830
 topic of the video at the time of which 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.750
 we wanted to talk today so we need to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.220
 talk about how to make a nuclear a 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.330
 interesting enough topic 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.330
 we can say no 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.640
 but how will the nuclear NUCLEAR 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.270
 on the 2012 coop 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.520
 then as you see boss even if you have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.860
 some previous videos and he is 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.250
 fond of the pd v we say then vi 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.250
 recommend maybe talking nuclear 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.900
 show use the weapon you like best 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.550
 in short, it is so that it can be promised 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.070
 before they seem to me like domesticity 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.860
 say security as a stopcock 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.370
 the most modest report sexy the okay 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.320
 hanging and in any case then the rewards 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 they are very important and above all if 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.270
 you want to get a nuclear 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.910
 organized I mean 33 think for example 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.290
 if I chin dog swarm brings together menu 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.910
 we didn't think in a joke itself 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.160
 they make the 100 more while you put web 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.730
 sat web counter feels certain 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.100
 devinu for and therefore in short these 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.500
 complexes are the most useful because there 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.890
 he wants to love just to even out 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.840
 this is for 430 touadi we are because 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.300
 all the various assists also arrived 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 even at 10 thousand points per game 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.690
 also it is therefore uphill and much 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 quickly especially with points 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:05.450
 double made 20 thousand had levels of 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.590
 amia games were played on 38 mayors 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:13.019
 however as you see we estimate in 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 demolition and a fucking moment 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.670
 garatti however for how melissa ship you are 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.830
 view however the problem is if why you are 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.810
 against you here they all have as you see 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.880
 even in truth not fifth for not 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.110
 as simple as you see 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.910
 in later moments when he will find 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.380
 no one in fact what he could 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.660
 be nuclear enough for 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.220
 the access transformed maybe longer 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.410
 one minute but always fast but it is 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.470
 fast yes yes but I hardly have you 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.730
 voted and therefore the panza format 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.390
 however they were excited because it is almost 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.400
 finished the video 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.150
 anyway for me to do maybe succeed 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.850
 let's do this thing 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.410
 at the beginning not to throw me in the spam if 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.100
 you are still inexperienced maybe not voting 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.320
 me spam 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.100
 try to do maybe a cloud of 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.600
 lower quality but I saw you are going 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.200
 a forum if you really want to take a 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.730
 at all costs 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.650
 we recommend this by cutting here if 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.750
 instead you want to make lively and gameplay 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.880
 nice try to go to the spots like 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.680
 will do as your mind does because 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.590
 arranges after you can good people 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.600
 in the ass sapping interviews so if 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.130
 okay if in place of these 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.510
 rewards like maybe we already have 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.770
 repeated also in other videos 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:33.060
 it is useful to also use santa's web 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:36.360
 you watched sat and mp that you love sat and 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.160
 juan look at sachs and I wanted to use the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.840
 my pious compact apostle may have no 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.400
 truth if you have if you have a weapon 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920
 silenced in my opinion is fine 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.440
 unipi while if not given maybe 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.160
 with web heel helps you to proceed towards 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.320
 the disaster 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.790
 since it disturbs her easier to 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.700
 therefore to reach if little damage to two 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.000
 points assist seems to be six days later 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.050
 because lnp did not get from any assist 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.430
 don't close here yes but only tells you ai 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.430
 least symbol not type 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.050
 no I didn't know the dinner right 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.520
 however what we can recommend other 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.900
 finally it was this game but totolo 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.160
 especially of course as you will have 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.850
 this can be what the commission is 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.110
 and the adversaries because in short there are 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.800
 many factors that can affect 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:30.170
 the light including luck that indeed 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:33.170
 as how you see how it is as you will see 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.150
 I too am retired lost arcagni swarm 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.950
 twice you are not seen everyone from 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.760
 from the Chinese first monate plants in the 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.830
 sign 9 was alive in the second scene 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.660
 I answer for this roof they did 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.510
 already seen as you know he took the house 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.100
 to greet between definite 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.690
 oh well it is the real that made the video vi 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.660
 liked not put a like no 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.660
 joking a comment by gt what you go 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.430
 you to start if you also have some 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.660
 other advice to go there and define yourself 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.660
 face data but no
