device<00:02:26.690> which<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.960> just<00:02:27.080> mentioned<00:02:27.470> earlier

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
device which I just mentioned earlier

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.640 
device which I just mentioned earlier

overall it comes with just 4gb of
internal<00:02:30.770> storage<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:31.280> again<00:02:31.610> for<00:02:32.120> this

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
internal storage but again for this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.670 
internal storage but again for this
price<00:02:32.600> that's<00:02:33.290> pretty<00:02:33.530> decent<00:02:33.680> enough<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
price that's pretty decent enough the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.230 
price that's pretty decent enough the
negative<00:02:37.040> aspect<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.820> comes<00:02:38.090> with

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
negative aspect is that it comes with

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.150 
negative aspect is that it comes with
just<00:02:38.630> two<00:02:38.990> megapixel<00:02:39.470> camera<00:02:39.770> which<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
just two megapixel camera which the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.560 
just two megapixel camera which the
company<00:02:40.400> should<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.700> been<00:02:40.850> encouraged<00:02:41.360> and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
company should have been encouraged and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.860 
company should have been encouraged and
also<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.980> doesn't<00:02:43.370> support<00:02:43.520> 3G<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.630> means

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
also it doesn't support 3G which means

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.150 
also it doesn't support 3G which means
that<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.140> are<00:02:45.170> using<00:02:45.380> planning<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> use

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
that if you are using planning to use

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.830

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
this device for accessing the web at a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.060 
this device for accessing the web at a
higher<00:02:48.080> speed<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.740> won't<00:02:48.950> be<00:02:49.040> possible

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
higher speed that won't be possible

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.880 
higher speed that won't be possible
because<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.240> supports<00:02:50.750> just<00:02:50.900> fuji

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
because this supports just fuji

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.340 
because this supports just fuji
connection<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.520> that<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.720> get<00:02:53.930> so
