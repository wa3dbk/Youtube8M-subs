I<00:00:24.410> see<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:25.160> that<00:00:25.460> collector<00:00:25.850> drone<00:00:26.530> has<00:00:27.530> held

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
I see that that collector drone has held

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.760 
I see that that collector drone has held
and<00:00:28.400> so<00:00:28.940> I<00:00:29.240> want<00:00:29.540> to<00:00:29.600> blow<00:00:29.810> him<00:00:30.080> up<00:00:30.110> instead<00:00:30.619> of

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
and so I want to blow him up instead of

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.170 
and so I want to blow him up instead of
you<00:00:30.890> know<00:00:30.920> going<00:00:31.190> after<00:00:31.520> Harbinger<00:00:31.970> right

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
you know going after Harbinger right

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.570

my<00:01:40.730> strategy<00:01:40.970> for<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.330> section<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.900> just<00:01:42.320> a

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
my strategy for this section is just a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.230 
my strategy for this section is just a
state<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:42.950> these<00:01:43.100> first<00:01:43.340> couple<00:01:43.550> areas<00:01:43.850> and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
state in these first couple areas and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.590 
state in these first couple areas and
try<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.050> keep<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.100> collectors<00:01:46.880> from<00:01:47.150> getting

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
try to keep the collectors from getting

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.510 
try to keep the collectors from getting
to<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:49.460> cover<00:01:50.000> spot<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.340> extreme<00:01:52.340> left

Harbinger switching to my heavy pistol
and<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.120> head<00:02:24.269> shots<00:02:24.569> in

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and just going to put the head shots in

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.069 
and just going to put the head shots in
to<00:02:25.260> finish<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.680> off<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.360> 4<00:02:27.540> section<00:02:27.959> I

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
to finish it off so that's a 4 section I

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.929 
to finish it off so that's a 4 section I
recommend<00:02:28.439> just<00:02:28.739> kind<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> sticking<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.610> that

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
recommend just kind of sticking at that

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.630 
recommend just kind of sticking at that
back<00:02:30.150> cover<00:02:30.860> advancing<00:02:31.860> any<00:02:31.980> further<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
back cover advancing any further and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
back cover advancing any further and
it's<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.480> easy<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.900> get<00:02:34.049> flanked<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it's really easy to get flanked and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610 
it's really easy to get flanked and
that's<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.609> worst<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:37.079> worst<00:02:37.109> part

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
that's really the worst the worst part

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.280 
that's really the worst the worst part
about<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.069> area<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.359> pretty<00:02:40.079> easy

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
about that area is that it's pretty easy

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.360 
about that area is that it's pretty easy
to<00:02:40.500> get<00:02:41.430> flanked<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:41.819> you're<00:02:41.939> not<00:02:42.030> careful

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
to get flanked if you're not careful

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
to get flanked if you're not careful
but<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.090> kill<00:02:44.239> them<00:02:44.299> fast<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.629> won't<00:02:44.720> get

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
but if you kill them fast you won't get

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.619 
but if you kill them fast you won't get
flanked<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.950> all<00:02:46.700> right<00:02:46.879> there<00:02:47.120> picking<00:02:47.569> up

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
flanked so all right there picking up

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.059

hits<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:49.200> warp<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.100> that's<00:03:50.400> something<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
hits of of warp so that's something to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.430 
hits of of warp so that's something to
watch<00:03:50.760> out<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.230> showing

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
work right next to him it reduces him

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.610 
work right next to him it reduces him
down<00:04:05.549> just<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.060> much<00:04:06.239> as<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.810> he<00:04:06.989> had<00:04:07.080> been<00:04:07.110> hit

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
and as you can see right there he can't

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.070 
and as you can see right there he can't
fire<00:05:30.620> over<00:05:30.979> just<00:05:31.189> because<00:05:31.309> of<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.849> angle<00:05:32.599> um

going<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:13.840> be<00:06:13.900> able<00:06:13.930> to<00:06:14.080> hit<00:06:14.170> you<00:06:14.610> so<00:06:15.610> just<00:06:16.480> you

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
going to be able to hit you so just you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.080 
going to be able to hit you so just you
know<00:06:17.170> make<00:06:17.410> sure<00:06:17.590> your<00:06:17.890> attack<00:06:18.520> is<00:06:18.550> making<00:06:19.000> its

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
know make sure your attack is making its

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.600 
know make sure your attack is making its
first<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.740> while<00:06:20.740> keeping<00:06:21.040> yourself<00:06:21.400> in<00:06:21.520> a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
first and while keeping yourself in a

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.810 
first and while keeping yourself in a
safe<00:06:21.970> position<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.890> you<00:06:23.890> shouldn't<00:06:24.130> have<00:06:24.340> too

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
safe position and you shouldn't have too

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.220 
safe position and you shouldn't have too
much<00:06:24.850> trouble<00:06:24.940> taking<00:06:25.390> this<00:06:25.540> guy<00:06:25.720> down<00:06:25.780> if

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230 
much trouble taking this guy down if

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.810 
much trouble taking this guy down if
you're<00:06:26.440> using<00:06:26.620> heavy<00:06:26.890> weapons<00:06:27.310> you<00:06:27.370> take<00:06:27.580> down

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
you're using heavy weapons you take down

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.220 
you're using heavy weapons you take down
even<00:06:28.090> faster<00:06:28.240> than

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
even faster than

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.980 
even faster than
so<00:06:30.830> that's<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.310> durian

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
so that's the durian

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.470 
so that's the durian
not<00:06:33.530> too<00:06:33.680> tricky<00:06:33.950> I<00:06:34.310> think<00:06:34.850> that's<00:06:35.030> an<00:06:35.180> easier

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
not too tricky I think that's an easier

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.090 
not too tricky I think that's an easier
fight<00:06:35.800> well<00:06:36.800> a<00:06:37.070> simpler<00:06:37.910> fight<00:06:38.180> than

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
fight well a simpler fight than

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.150 
fight well a simpler fight than
earlier<00:06:40.730> ad<00:06:41.360> on<00:06:41.870> horizon<00:06:43.660> so<00:06:44.660> that<00:06:44.750> concludes

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
earlier ad on horizon so that concludes

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.470 
earlier ad on horizon so that concludes
this<00:06:46.160> part<00:06:46.460> of<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.610> video<00:06:48.730> next<00:06:49.730> up<00:06:49.880> I'll<00:06:50.090> be
