the<00:02:06.990> ACR<00:02:08.360> with<00:02:09.360> low<00:02:09.539> sensitivity<00:02:09.929> than<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the ACR with low sensitivity than if I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.980 
the ACR with low sensitivity than if I
would<00:02:10.920> go<00:02:11.070> really<00:02:11.280> high<00:02:11.430> sensitivity<00:02:11.990> they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
would go really high sensitivity they

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.630 
would go really high sensitivity they
try<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> convince<00:02:13.590> me<00:02:13.860> which<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.280> thought<00:02:14.460> was

sensitivity<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.070> very

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
sensitivity and I think that's very

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.890 
sensitivity and I think that's very
funny<00:02:20.520> because<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.000> know<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.690> pros

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
funny because I know the one of the pros
