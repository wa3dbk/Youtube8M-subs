00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.230
 I stand at the Brandenburg Gate beautiful building very nicely highlighted 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 and that should of course not be missing and my and night syria 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.269
 what are the settings that the camera can use 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.869
 first of all I put it in the final position, I go the exposure manually 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.240
 set because I can't trust my light meter 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.400
 that lies meter that sees that dark sky 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 and he actually wanted to make it mid-gray and chances are that he will do everything 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.580
 is about reported 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.280
 shutter speed that becomes quite long 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.810
 in this case three heads for 2 seconds and an aperture is seven coming in that 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.660
 shop the two seconds they long time was no problem because I work from 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 tripod 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.860
 To prevent anything else from being revealed I also have my mirror in advance 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.480
 folded up 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 blow it the moment I take the photo to make it sound like that 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.750
 become the spyker again by pressing 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 now he takes the photo which is again to prevent vibrations so you can 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.290
 to fix it in advance 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 I have come to use the autofocus in this case because there is enough light 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.270
 therefore sufficient contrast 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.360
 but that may not work 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.640
 just put the seven on my new one or also once and by hand 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 focusing 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 There are objective nowadays that we have one in the cities 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 the moment you work on a tripod you have to switch it off, it just goes 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.510
 work against you 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.520
 you have those matches that you want 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.730
 To honor the movement of bars At the moment there is no movement 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.190
 and still wanted to work 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.250
 it's not going to be okay 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 I have it so low that I have 100 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.460
 I would have shown why 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 make your mistakes again 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.580
 what I'm going to do now 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.350
 can put this up here 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.700
 of which 100 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.340
 after 64 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.290
 People often think that night photography is not that high 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 must stand 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.720
 that is not at all true if I do now take the photo with the same exposures 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.279
 is overexposed in the type 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.019
 the light signal on the sensor actually amplifies it 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.069
 the sensor that now needs much less light to be able to participate 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.719
 so I have to adjust my exposure 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.969
 I can know 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.999
 and for the calculators and drove in the same direction to get certainly after an hour already 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.219
 almost everyone comes 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.139
 the creg shows exactly the same objections that exactly the same direction too 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.139
 to get 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.659
 these look like the same pictures 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.839
 when I am going to enlarge these photos 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:45.820
 I will notice that that photo from 64 to the title 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.219
 spend much more 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.269
 it is much less beautiful there is another reason 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.869
 on the contrary, I like to drive with slow shutter speeds 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.569
 this building is standing still it is very nice to wait until there 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.229
 cyclists come along here 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.949
 and if I then work with those long shutter speeds, we will go nicely here 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
 strive for the city that was shown in the extra travel time 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:13.659
 it's just a little bit 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.089
 started raining 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.079
 you could say stop it 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.889
 actually it only gets nicer but it doesn't get much out of it 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.009
 Brussels 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.539
 The reflections from the of the lamps that you are coming now become very beautiful 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.489
 reflected in the sidewalk 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.749
 and it gives you a picture 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.749
 nice all those different colors 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.589
 if you have been in use for as long as possible, the capital is kiev 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.679
 make sure that a leg of the festival is under the objective that it is a lot 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.279
 firmer 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:50.339
 and if you accidentally get the camera if that means the flames are on then 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:53.339
 I have the chance of an accident 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.820
 my tip 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.529
 continue to be yourself 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.450
 Modern cameras can do more every year, so it makes sense to 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.329
 practice with the newest possibilities 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.120
 yes that is taking pictures today 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.499
 it seemed impossible yesterday
