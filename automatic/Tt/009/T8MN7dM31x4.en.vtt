00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 

and<00:00:00.089> then<00:00:00.510> what<00:00:00.719> should<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:00.870> plug<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.199> for

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
and then what should we plug in for

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.530 
and then what should we plug in for
delta<00:00:01.650> T<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:02.129> guess<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:02.639> now<00:00:02.730> know<00:00:02.879> delta<00:00:03.179> T<00:00:03.330> do

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
delta T I guess we now know delta T do

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:14.560 
delta T I guess we now know delta T do
it<00:00:03.689> so<00:00:04.589> just<00:00:04.890> plug<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.220> delta<00:00:05.549> T<00:00:05.730> here<00:00:05.970> ah

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.060 

alright<00:00:15.570> yeah<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.080> could<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.500> however

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
alright yeah you could do that however

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060 
alright yeah you could do that however
first<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:17.910> remember<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.830> don't<00:00:19.920> have

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
first of all remember that we don't have

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.939 
first of all remember that we don't have
to<00:00:20.279> translate<00:00:20.550> into<00:00:20.760> Calvin's<00:00:21.680> because<00:00:22.680> we're

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to translate into Calvin's because we're

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.220 
to translate into Calvin's because we're
working<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.250> delta<00:00:23.580> T<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.810> could<00:00:25.019> plug

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
working with delta T so you could plug

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.609 
working with delta T so you could plug
in<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:30.390> could<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.570> plug<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.960> t<00:00:31.170> final<00:00:31.410> minus

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
in you could just plug in t final minus

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
in you could just plug in t final minus
10<00:00:31.920> degrees<00:00:31.949> Celsius<00:00:32.610> since<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.540> working

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
10 degrees Celsius since we're working

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
10 degrees Celsius since we're working
with<00:00:33.809> delta<00:00:34.110> T<00:00:34.230> we're<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.680> sure<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> do

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
with delta T we're not sure going to do

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.010 
with delta T we're not sure going to do
that<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.610> yeah<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> could<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.510> by<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that but yeah you could do this by the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
that but yeah you could do this by the
way<00:00:37.250> notice<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.730> intelligence

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
way notice that this was intelligence

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.360 
way notice that this was intelligence
but<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> doesn't<00:00:40.290> matter<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.680> kelvins

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
but it doesn't matter because kelvins

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
but it doesn't matter because kelvins
and<00:00:41.520> salsas<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:42.690> delta<00:00:43.020> T<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and salsas are the same for delta T a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.560 
and salsas are the same for delta T a
change<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.520> temperature<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.030> Kelvin<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
change in temperature in Kelvin is the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.010 
change in temperature in Kelvin is the
same<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> temperature<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.620> Celsius<00:00:47.070> so

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
same as the temperature in Celsius so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.360 
same as the temperature in Celsius so
might<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.079> well<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.620> into<00:00:49.829> Celsius

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
might as well just put this into Celsius

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
might as well just put this into Celsius
here<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.260> thing<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.680> we're

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
here it's the same thing because we're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
here it's the same thing because we're
dick<00:00:52.890> working<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.219> delta<00:00:53.520> T<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.149> now

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
dick working with delta T all right now

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.639 
dick working with delta T all right now
even<00:00:54.510> though<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
even though you could do this it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.900 
even though you could do this it's
probably<00:00:55.890> not<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> best<00:00:56.190> approach<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
probably not the best approach for this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.569 
probably not the best approach for this
particular<00:00:57.360> problem<00:00:58.309> actually<00:00:59.309> maybe<00:00:59.430> they

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
particular problem actually maybe they

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.790 
particular problem actually maybe they
actually<00:00:59.879> would<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.030> good<00:01:00.449> practice<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
actually would be good practice for the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually would be good practice for the
problem<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.430> doing<00:01:02.579> actually

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
problem we're going to be doing actually

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.260 
problem we're going to be doing actually
you<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.439> we

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
you don't now that I think about it we

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
you don't now that I think about it we
we<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> start<00:01:06.960> getting<00:01:07.020> used<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> doing

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
we need to start getting used to doing

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.030 
we need to start getting used to doing
this<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.070> yeah<00:01:08.220> let's<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> okay

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
this so yeah let's actually do this okay

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.770 
this so yeah let's actually do this okay
all<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.610> should<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.090> well

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
all right so what should we do now well

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.510 
all right so what should we do now well
first<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.860> any<00:01:14.070> units<00:01:14.369> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
first of all can you see any units that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.510 
first of all can you see any units that
we<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> simplify<00:01:18.080> yeah<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.500> let's<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.250> do

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we can simplify yeah and let's just do

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
we can simplify yeah and let's just do
any<00:01:20.670> calculations<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.350> any

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
any calculations we can so is there any

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.370 
any calculations we can so is there any
calculations<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.520> now<00:01:26.869> 41<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
calculations we can do right now 41 is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
calculations we can do right now 41 is
it<00:01:28.530> 4184<00:01:29.220> oh<00:01:29.430> yeah<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> wrote<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> wrong

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it 4184 oh yeah I wrote down the wrong

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:48.520 
it 4184 oh yeah I wrote down the wrong
thing<00:01:30.390> overboard

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.260 

on<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.250> right<00:01:49.430> hand<00:01:49.460> left<00:01:49.700> hand<00:01:49.850> side<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.090> guess

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
on the right hand left hand side I guess

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.600 
on the right hand left hand side I guess
I<00:01:50.360> should<00:01:50.510> have<00:01:50.570> written<00:01:50.690> Jules<00:01:54.610> 20,000

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
I should have written Jules 20,000

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.480 
I should have written Jules 20,000
joules<00:01:55.760> so<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.659> Jules<00:01:57.200> over<00:01:57.590> here<00:01:57.860> and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
joules so this is Jules over here and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:07.650 
joules so this is Jules over here and
then<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> right<00:01:59.030> hand<00:01:59.060> side<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.750> got<00:01:59.930> 12<00:02:02.140> 55<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.680 

Jules<00:02:09.550> yeah<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.120> user<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.480> going<00:02:11.510> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
Jules yeah the user is going to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.770 
Jules yeah the user is going to
computers<00:02:12.050> let's<00:02:12.350> take<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> exact<00:02:13.780> since

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
computers let's take the exact since

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.440 
computers let's take the exact since
we're<00:02:14.930> using<00:02:14.959> all<00:02:15.319> consistent<00:02:15.650> units<00:02:22.450> yeah

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
we're using all consistent units yeah

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.300 
we're using all consistent units yeah
this<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:23.959> much<00:02:24.170> simple<00:02:24.620> about<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.010> units

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
this is so much simple about the units

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.550 
this is so much simple about the units
all<00:02:25.820> right<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.269> take<00:02:26.420> out<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.600> units<00:02:26.989> we

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
all right so we take out the units we

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.259 
all right so we take out the units we
get<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.860> all<00:02:28.610> right<00:02:28.730> what's<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> next<00:02:29.150> thing

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
get this all right what's the next thing

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.430 
get this all right what's the next thing
we<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.780> simplify<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.230> right-hand

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
we can do to simplify the right-hand

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.370 
we can do to simplify the right-hand
side<00:02:34.209> okay<00:02:35.209> good<00:02:35.480> actually<00:02:36.050> that's<00:02:36.200> better

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
side okay good actually that's better

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.360 
side okay good actually that's better
than<00:02:36.530> what<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.650> was<00:02:36.769> going<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.130> was<00:02:37.250> going

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
than what I was going to do I was going

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.670 
than what I was going to do I was going
to<00:02:37.459> use<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.670> distributive<00:02:37.910> law<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.569> x<00:02:38.989> 12<00:02:39.410> but

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
to use the distributive law and x 12 but

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.110 
to use the distributive law and x 12 but
actually<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.250> better<00:02:40.430> just<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.670> divide<00:02:40.940> both

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
actually it's better just to divide both

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.820 
actually it's better just to divide both
sides<00:02:41.180> that'll<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.930> rid<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.170> all<00:02:42.680> right

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
sides that'll get rid of that all right

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:54.110 
sides that'll get rid of that all right
so<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.100> do<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.190> get<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.550> do<00:02:43.670> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.320 

okay<00:02:55.120> good

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:16.809 

59<00:03:05.170> what<00:03:05.320> would<00:03:05.410> be<00:03:05.500> Venus<00:03:05.620> on<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:08.100> which<00:03:09.100> one

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.709 

it<00:03:17.819> looks<00:03:17.969> like<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.150> hadn't<00:03:18.329> confused<00:03:18.629> about

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:18.719 
it looks like we hadn't confused about

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.479 
it looks like we hadn't confused about
that<00:03:18.930> let's<00:03:19.530> take<00:03:19.680> our<00:03:19.799> time<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:20.159> think<00:03:20.280> that

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
that let's take our time to think that

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.759 
that let's take our time to think that
through<00:03:20.780> what<00:03:21.780> what's<00:03:22.170> upper<00:03:22.319> Tribune<00:03:22.709> we

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
through what what's upper Tribune we

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.399 
through what what's upper Tribune we
plug<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:24.409> 10<00:03:25.409> degrees<00:03:25.739> Celsius<00:03:26.269> so<00:03:27.269> what<00:03:27.870> so

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
plug in 10 degrees Celsius so what so

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.869 
plug in 10 degrees Celsius so what so
this<00:03:28.560> must<00:03:28.739> be<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:28.950> Celsius<00:03:29.400> ok<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.609> ended

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
this must be in Celsius ok so this ended

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.179 
this must be in Celsius ok so this ended
up<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.120> Celsius<00:03:33.569> over<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.049> 11.5<00:03:34.920> million

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
up in Celsius over here 11.5 million

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.399 
up in Celsius over here 11.5 million
degrees<00:03:35.400> Celsius<00:03:36.000> um<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.079> use<00:03:37.230> either

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
degrees Celsius um so you can use either

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.960 
degrees Celsius um so you can use either
Celsius<00:03:38.010> or<00:03:38.099> Kelvin<00:03:38.489> here<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:38.849> we're

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
Celsius or Kelvin here because we're

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.030 
Celsius or Kelvin here because we're
working<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.299> delta<00:03:39.659> T<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.680> have<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.920> be

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
working with delta T but you have to be

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.740 
working with delta T but you have to be
consistent<00:03:41.250> about<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.329> start<00:03:42.569> off

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
consistent about it if you start off

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
consistent about it if you start off
working<00:03:43.049> with<00:03:43.290> Celsius<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.069> stick

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
working with Celsius you have to stick

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.949 
working with Celsius you have to stick
with<00:03:44.250> Celsius<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.150> start<00:03:45.359> with<00:03:45.510> Kelvin<00:03:45.689> yet

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
with Celsius you start with Kelvin yet

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.259 
with Celsius you start with Kelvin yet
mistake<00:03:46.230> let's<00:03:46.409> go<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.889> here<00:03:47.129> we've<00:03:47.250> got<00:03:47.280> 11.59

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
mistake let's go so here we've got 11.59

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.509 
mistake let's go so here we've got 11.59
degrees<00:03:48.810> Celsius<00:03:49.290> I'm<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.069> actually<00:03:50.370> looks

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
degrees Celsius I'm so actually looks

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.160 
degrees Celsius I'm so actually looks
like<00:03:50.609> i<00:03:50.760> exaggerated<00:03:51.389> on<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.569> board<00:03:51.810> here<00:03:52.049> if

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
like i exaggerated on the board here if

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.300 
like i exaggerated on the board here if
we're<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.530> temperatures<00:03:52.889> not<00:03:52.950> going<00:03:53.189> up

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
we're not the temperatures not going up

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.190 
we're not the temperatures not going up
very<00:03:53.340> much<00:03:53.700> temperatures<00:03:54.689> really<00:03:54.840> only<00:03:55.019> going

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
very much temperatures really only going

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.830 
very much temperatures really only going
up<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.439> little<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:56.090> better<00:03:57.090> final<00:03:57.569> temperature

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
up a little bit better final temperature

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:21.500 
up a little bit better final temperature
here<00:03:59.569> B<00:04:02.599> 11.59<00:04:03.599> degrees<00:04:04.260> Celsius<00:04:06.739> okay

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.600 

okay<00:04:22.230> that's<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.740> very<00:04:22.980> important<00:04:23.370> type<00:04:23.460> of

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
okay that's a very important type of

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.770 
okay that's a very important type of
problem<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.060> hopefully<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.390> have<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.660> in

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
problem so hopefully you have that in

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.410 
problem so hopefully you have that in
your<00:04:24.870> notes<00:04:25.050> you'll<00:04:25.260> go<00:04:25.350> back<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.740> redo<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.420> so

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
your notes you'll go back and redo it so

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.820 
your notes you'll go back and redo it so
that's<00:04:27.600> how<00:04:27.660> we<00:04:27.720> use<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.050> how<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.620> know<00:04:28.770> to

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
that's how we use this how do we know to

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.380 
that's how we use this how do we know to
use<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.160> formula<00:04:29.490> because<00:04:29.910> we<00:04:30.060> were<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.300> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
use this formula because we were in the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.590 
use this formula because we were in the
temperature<00:04:30.750> change<00:04:30.990> region<00:04:32.360> if<00:04:33.360> we<00:04:33.480> were<00:04:33.570> in

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
temperature change region if we were in

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120 
temperature change region if we were in
a<00:04:33.690> phase<00:04:33.870> change<00:04:33.900> region<00:04:34.410> we<00:04:34.710> would<00:04:34.830> use<00:04:34.980> this

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
a phase change region we would use this

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.550 
a phase change region we would use this
formula<00:04:35.460> over<00:04:35.850> here<00:04:36.350> so<00:04:37.350> what's<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.650> 4184<00:04:38.580> me

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
formula over here so what's this 4184 me

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:49.060 
formula over here so what's this 4184 me
what<00:04:40.560> were<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.740> units<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> 4184<00:04:41.910> again

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.850 

did<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.190> interpret<00:04:50.670> this<00:04:51.200> well<00:04:52.200> remember<00:04:52.770> this

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
did we interpret this well remember this

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.710 
did we interpret this well remember this
is<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.130> civic<00:04:53.490> heat<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.760> water<00:04:53.940> number<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.510> good

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
is the civic heat of water number a good

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.630 
is the civic heat of water number a good
way<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.900> interpret<00:04:55.230> units<00:04:55.710> if<00:04:55.920> there's<00:04:56.370> units

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
way to interpret units if there's units

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.040 
way to interpret units if there's units
on<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.820> bottom<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.270> fraction<00:04:57.420> is<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> put<00:04:58.020> a

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
on the bottom of a fraction is to put a

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.650 
on the bottom of a fraction is to put a
one<00:04:58.350> in<00:04:58.560> front<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.980> them<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.420> here<00:05:00.420> we<00:05:00.570> have

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
one in front of them and here we have

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.910 
one in front of them and here we have
two<00:05:00.840> units<00:05:01.140> on<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.290> bottom<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:01.680> it's<00:05:01.800> put<00:05:01.890> a

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
two units on the bottom so it's put a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.310 
two units on the bottom so it's put a
one<00:05:02.130> in<00:05:02.160> front<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.460> this<00:05:02.610> as<00:05:02.760> well<00:05:03.200> after<00:05:04.200> all

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
one in front of this as well after all

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.720 
one in front of this as well after all
putting<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.770> one<00:05:04.920> it<00:05:05.040> doesn't<00:05:05.220> change<00:05:05.460> things

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
putting the one it doesn't change things

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.700 
putting the one it doesn't change things
what<00:05:06.270> does<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:06.420> mean<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.170> means<00:05:07.230> if<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.590> got

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
what does this mean it means if you got

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.680 
what does this mean it means if you got
a<00:05:07.740> kilogram<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.250> water<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.480> want<00:05:09.630> to

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
a kilogram of water and you want to

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.970 
a kilogram of water and you want to
increase<00:05:09.930> its<00:05:10.110> temperature<00:05:10.200> by<00:05:10.710> one<00:05:10.740> degree

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
increase its temperature by one degree

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.840 
increase its temperature by one degree
Kelvin<00:05:11.640> you<00:05:12.390> got<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.660> add<00:05:12.750> 4148<00:05:13.710> jewels<00:05:14.070> so

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
Kelvin you got to add 4148 jewels so

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.340 
Kelvin you got to add 4148 jewels so
it's<00:05:15.000> good<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.360> an<00:05:15.510> interpretation<00:05:16.020> with

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
it's good to have an interpretation with

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.050 
it's good to have an interpretation with
the<00:05:16.440> specific<00:05:16.590> heat<00:05:16.890> tells<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:17.640> putting<00:05:17.910> a

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the specific heat tells you so putting a

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.640 
the specific heat tells you so putting a
one<00:05:18.240> on<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.570> bottom<00:05:18.720> of<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.020> fraction<00:05:19.170> really

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
one on the bottom of a fraction really

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.230 
one on the bottom of a fraction really
helps<00:05:19.860> us<00:05:19.920> to<00:05:20.070> interpret<00:05:20.430> these<00:05:20.700> complicated

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
helps us to interpret these complicated

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.630 
helps us to interpret these complicated
units<00:05:21.660> this<00:05:22.290> is<00:05:22.350> telling<00:05:22.770> us<00:05:22.890> they<00:05:23.070> got<00:05:23.430> one

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
units this is telling us they got one

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.610 
units this is telling us they got one
kilogram<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.120> water<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.750> we<00:05:25.050> want<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.380> raise

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
kilogram of water and we want to raise

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.830 
kilogram of water and we want to raise
its<00:05:25.890> temperature<00:05:25.950> by<00:05:26.520> one<00:05:26.550> Kelvin<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.720> is

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
its temperature by one Kelvin this is

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.870 
its temperature by one Kelvin this is
how<00:05:27.960> much<00:05:28.080> energy<00:05:28.260> you<00:05:28.470> would<00:05:28.620> take<00:05:28.880> 4148

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
how much energy you would take 4148

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.820 
how much energy you would take 4148
jewels<00:05:30.210> this<00:05:30.690> is<00:05:30.810> why<00:05:30.960> i<00:05:30.990> said<00:05:31.290> before<00:05:31.410> that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
jewels this is why i said before that

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.560 
jewels this is why i said before that
this<00:05:31.920> tells<00:05:32.190> us<00:05:32.310> how<00:05:32.730> hard<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.180> is<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.450> raise

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
this tells us how hard it is to raise

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.150 
this tells us how hard it is to raise
the<00:05:33.750> temperature<00:05:34.020> because<00:05:34.740> if<00:05:34.860> this<00:05:34.950> was<00:05:35.130> a

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
the temperature because if this was a

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.200 
the temperature because if this was a
bigger<00:05:35.370> number<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.790> would<00:05:35.940> mean<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.180> would

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
bigger number it would mean it would

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.760 
bigger number it would mean it would
take<00:05:36.420> more<00:05:36.630> heat<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.080> raise<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:37.530> temperature

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
take more heat to raise the temperature

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.080 
take more heat to raise the temperature
by<00:05:38.070> one<00:05:38.100> degree<00:05:38.280> kelvin<00:05:40.790> we<00:05:41.790> didn't<00:05:42.000> actually

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
by one degree kelvin we didn't actually

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.430 
by one degree kelvin we didn't actually
have<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.390> think<00:05:42.570> through<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.840> logic<00:05:43.170> I<00:05:43.260> guess

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
have to think through that logic I guess

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.420 
have to think through that logic I guess
when<00:05:43.590> we<00:05:43.650> were<00:05:43.740> just<00:05:43.860> pointing<00:05:44.040> into<00:05:44.340> the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
when we were just pointing into the

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.890 
when we were just pointing into the
formula<00:05:44.730> but<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:45.210> really<00:05:45.420> helps<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.720> have<00:05:45.840> a

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
formula but it really helps to have a

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.480 
formula but it really helps to have a
little<00:05:46.050> intuition<00:05:46.380> for<00:05:46.740> what<00:05:46.830> C<00:05:47.040> is<00:05:47.070> telling

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
little intuition for what C is telling

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.700 
little intuition for what C is telling
us<00:05:47.660> so<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:48.840> telling<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.230> skin<00:05:49.410> how<00:05:49.560> much

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
us so this is telling the skin how much

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.650 
us so this is telling the skin how much
energy<00:05:49.890> would<00:05:50.220> take<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.700> raise<00:05:50.880> one<00:05:51.210> kilogram

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
energy would take to raise one kilogram

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.140 
energy would take to raise one kilogram
of<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.900> substance<00:05:52.320> one<00:05:52.560> degree<00:05:52.830> Kelvin<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:54.030> if

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
of the substance one degree Kelvin so if

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.460 
of the substance one degree Kelvin so if
we<00:05:54.240> wanted<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:54.570> raise<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:54.990> by<00:05:55.110> 2<00:05:55.170> degrees

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
we wanted to raise it by 2 degrees

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.810 
we wanted to raise it by 2 degrees
Kelvin<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.130> would<00:05:56.250> take<00:05:56.370> twice<00:05:56.580> as<00:05:56.610> much

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
Kelvin it would take twice as much

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.080 
Kelvin it would take twice as much
energy<00:05:57.050> or<00:05:58.050> if<00:05:58.980> we<00:05:59.220> wanted<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.640> raise<00:05:59.820> it<00:06:00.000> by

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
energy or if we wanted to raise it by

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.430 
energy or if we wanted to raise it by
one<00:06:00.300> degree<00:06:00.450> Kelvin<00:06:00.930> and<00:06:01.080> we<00:06:01.170> have<00:06:01.260> two

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
one degree Kelvin and we have two

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.750 
one degree Kelvin and we have two
kilograms<00:06:01.920> it<00:06:02.100> would<00:06:02.190> take<00:06:02.310> twice<00:06:02.520> as<00:06:02.550> much

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
kilograms it would take twice as much

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.790 
kilograms it would take twice as much
energy<00:06:03.060> clearly<00:06:03.720> the<00:06:03.810> more<00:06:03.960> massive<00:06:04.230> have<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
energy clearly the more massive have the

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.930 
energy clearly the more massive have the
more<00:06:04.920> energy<00:06:05.040> it<00:06:05.370> takes<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.640> raise<00:06:05.790> the

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
more energy it takes to raise the

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.300 
more energy it takes to raise the
temperature<00:06:06.620> okay<00:06:07.620> so<00:06:07.680> that's<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:07.950> basic

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
temperature okay so that's the basic

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.280 
temperature okay so that's the basic
interpretation<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.180> specific<00:06:09.600> heat<00:06:09.630> how

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
interpretation of the specific heat how

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.960 
interpretation of the specific heat how
much<00:06:10.500> heat<00:06:10.740> it<00:06:10.920> takes<00:06:11.160> to<00:06:11.610> raise<00:06:11.760> the

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
much heat it takes to raise the

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.180 
much heat it takes to raise the
temperature<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.600> one<00:06:13.350> kilogram<00:06:13.620> with<00:06:14.070> that

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
temperature of one kilogram with that

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.130 
temperature of one kilogram with that
specific<00:06:14.370> substance<00:06:15.090> by<00:06:15.300> one<00:06:15.510> degree<00:06:15.660> Cal<00:06:18.140> I'm

specific substance by one degree Cal I'm
class<00:06:19.410> all<00:06:20.250> right<00:06:20.430> so<00:06:20.880> still<00:06:21.750> some<00:06:21.870> important

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
class all right so still some important

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:33.410 
class all right so still some important
have<00:06:23.070> to<00:06:23.190> go<00:06:23.310> over<00:06:23.520> here<00:06:23.760> so

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.360 

one<00:06:34.050> thing<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.200> notice<00:06:34.440> in<00:06:34.680> these<00:06:34.830> equations

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
one thing to notice in these equations

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.090 
one thing to notice in these equations
here<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.790> I<00:06:36.200> notice<00:06:37.200> that<00:06:37.320> in<00:06:37.410> this<00:06:37.440> equation<00:06:37.800> I

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
here is I notice that in this equation I

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.670 
here is I notice that in this equation I
put<00:06:38.250> a<00:06:38.280> big<00:06:38.490> fat<00:06:38.520> dot<00:06:39.060> over<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.540> q<00:06:39.840> whereas<00:06:40.590> in

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
put a big fat dot over the q whereas in

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.920 
put a big fat dot over the q whereas in
this<00:06:40.800> equation<00:06:41.100> I<00:06:41.490> didn't<00:06:41.850> put<00:06:41.970> a<00:06:42.000> dot<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.450> we

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
this equation I didn't put a dot and we

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.870 
this equation I didn't put a dot and we
know<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.170> significance<00:06:43.320> of<00:06:43.800> that<00:06:43.860> is<00:06:44.310> when

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
know the significance of that is when

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.130 
know the significance of that is when
the<00:06:44.910> dumb<00:06:45.180> when<00:06:45.330> we<00:06:45.450> put<00:06:45.600> to<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:45.750> dock<00:06:45.930> you

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
the dumb when we put to the dock you

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.330 
the dumb when we put to the dock you
know<00:06:46.260> I<00:06:46.320> like<00:06:46.560> to<00:06:46.680> use<00:06:46.830> that<00:06:46.860> just<00:06:47.160> for

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
know I like to use that just for

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.430 
know I like to use that just for
magnitudes<00:06:47.820> so<00:06:48.330> this<00:06:48.450> formula<00:06:48.720> just<00:06:49.080> tells<00:06:49.290> us

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
magnitudes so this formula just tells us

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.680 
magnitudes so this formula just tells us
the<00:06:49.590> magnitude<00:06:50.160> of<00:06:50.340> the<00:06:50.940> heat<00:06:51.270> when<00:06:51.570> you're

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
the magnitude of the heat when you're

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.830 
the magnitude of the heat when you're
changing<00:06:51.900> phase<00:06:53.300> whereas<00:06:54.300> this<00:06:54.420> formula

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
changing phase whereas this formula

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.610 
changing phase whereas this formula
actually<00:06:55.020> tells<00:06:55.440> you<00:06:55.680> the<00:06:56.520> signs<00:06:56.760> as<00:06:57.090> well

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
actually tells you the signs as well

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.570 
actually tells you the signs as well
remember<00:06:58.620> that<00:06:58.770> when<00:06:58.860> we<00:06:58.890> use<00:06:59.130> this<00:06:59.310> formula

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
remember that when we use this formula

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.700 
remember that when we use this formula
we<00:06:59.820> actually<00:07:00.090> plugged<00:07:00.330> in<00:07:00.450> positive<00:07:00.990> 20,000

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
we actually plugged in positive 20,000

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.960 
we actually plugged in positive 20,000
because<00:07:01.860> we're<00:07:02.010> actually<00:07:02.160> adding<00:07:02.460> heat<00:07:02.790> if

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
because we're actually adding heat if

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.160 
because we're actually adding heat if
we've<00:07:03.090> been<00:07:03.210> removing<00:07:03.600> people<00:07:03.810> you<00:07:03.960> would<00:07:04.050> put

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
we've been removing people you would put

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.770 
we've been removing people you would put
in<00:07:04.290> negative<00:07:04.410> twenty<00:07:04.830> thousand<00:07:05.420> but<00:07:06.420> the

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
in negative twenty thousand but the

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.540 
in negative twenty thousand but the
changing<00:07:07.200> phase<00:07:07.410> equation<00:07:07.950> is<00:07:08.100> just<00:07:08.310> in<00:07:08.430> terms

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
changing phase equation is just in terms

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:15.020 
changing phase equation is just in terms
of<00:07:08.730> magnitudes<00:07:13.370> so<00:07:14.370> you<00:07:14.430> have<00:07:14.640> to<00:07:14.700> put<00:07:14.850> in<00:07:14.940> the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
of magnitudes so you have to put in the

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.030 
of magnitudes so you have to put in the
sign<00:07:15.210> yourself<00:07:15.390> so<00:07:16.380> let's<00:07:16.770> see<00:07:16.890> how<00:07:16.920> that

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
sign yourself so let's see how that

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.920 
sign yourself so let's see how that
would<00:07:17.220> work<00:07:17.280> let's<00:07:18.210> say<00:07:18.330> that<00:07:18.360> you<00:07:18.570> wanted<00:07:18.810> to

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
would work let's say that you wanted to

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:28.040 
would work let's say that you wanted to
go<00:07:19.080> from<00:07:19.410> here<00:07:19.470> to<00:07:20.030> here<00:07:26.720> so<00:07:27.720> this<00:07:27.840> would<00:07:28.020> be

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
go from here to here so this would be

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.300 
go from here to here so this would be
your<00:07:28.170> initial<00:07:28.650> point<00:07:28.890> of<00:07:28.980> this<00:07:29.040> would<00:07:29.190> be<00:07:29.280> your

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
your initial point of this would be your

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.400 
your initial point of this would be your
final<00:07:29.730> point<00:07:29.940> well<00:07:30.420> how<00:07:30.720> do<00:07:30.780> you<00:07:30.900> do<00:07:31.020> that<00:07:31.050> by

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
final point well how do you do that by

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.120 
final point well how do you do that by
adding<00:07:31.620> heat<00:07:31.980> or<00:07:32.160> removing<00:07:32.550> heat<00:07:33.680> soak<00:07:34.680> you<00:07:35.010> be

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130 
adding heat or removing heat soak you be

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.400 
adding heat or removing heat soak you be
positive<00:07:35.550> or<00:07:35.640> negative<00:07:35.820> yeah<00:07:36.810> so<00:07:37.230> you<00:07:37.290> would

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.410 
positive or negative yeah so you would

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.170 
positive or negative yeah so you would
use<00:07:37.620> this<00:07:37.800> formula<00:07:38.130> to<00:07:38.340> figure<00:07:38.460> out<00:07:38.730> a<00:07:38.910> number

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
use this formula to figure out a number

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.210 
use this formula to figure out a number
for<00:07:39.540> Q<00:07:39.720> but<00:07:40.500> then<00:07:40.680> you<00:07:40.830> would<00:07:40.950> know<00:07:41.070> on<00:07:41.190> your

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
for Q but then you would know on your

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.820 
for Q but then you would know on your
own<00:07:41.430> that<00:07:41.460> Q<00:07:41.850> would<00:07:42.000> be<00:07:42.120> positive<00:07:42.480> or<00:07:42.740> on<00:07:43.740> the

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
own that Q would be positive or on the

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.010 
own that Q would be positive or on the
other<00:07:43.860> hand<00:07:44.160> let's<00:07:44.940> say<00:07:45.150> we're<00:07:45.360> going<00:07:45.660> from

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 
other hand let's say we're going from

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.720 
other hand let's say we're going from
here<00:07:46.080> to<00:07:46.440> here<00:07:48.080> are<00:07:49.130> we<00:07:50.130> adding<00:07:50.280> heat<00:07:50.580> or

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:50.730 
here to here are we adding heat or

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.840 
here to here are we adding heat or
removing<00:07:51.090> heat<00:07:51.860> soak<00:07:52.860> you<00:07:53.190> be<00:07:53.310> positive<00:07:53.730> and

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:53.850 
removing heat soak you be positive and

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.210 
removing heat soak you be positive and
negative<00:07:54.210> so<00:07:55.050> this<00:07:55.080> formula<00:07:55.650> will<00:07:55.920> just<00:07:56.070> give

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 
negative so this formula will just give

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.710 
negative so this formula will just give
you<00:07:56.250> a<00:07:56.400> number<00:07:56.580> for<00:07:56.910> Q<00:07:57.090> and<00:07:57.120> then<00:07:57.420> we<00:07:57.540> have<00:07:57.690> to

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 
you a number for Q and then we have to

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.330 
you a number for Q and then we have to
tag<00:07:57.990> on<00:07:58.140> a<00:07:58.170> negative<00:07:58.590> sign<00:07:58.770> because<00:07:58.950> we<00:07:59.220> know

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 
tag on a negative sign because we know

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.650 
tag on a negative sign because we know
we're<00:07:59.490> removing<00:07:59.700> eat<00:08:00.030> all<00:08:00.360> right<00:08:00.480> so<00:08:00.570> let's

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 
we're removing eat all right so let's

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.980 
we're removing eat all right so let's
see<00:08:00.840> how<00:08:00.870> we<00:08:00.990> would<00:08:01.170> use<00:08:01.230> this<00:08:01.500> formula<00:08:01.830> here
