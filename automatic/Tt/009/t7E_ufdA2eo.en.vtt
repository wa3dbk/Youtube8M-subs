you probably wouldn't expect there to be
any<00:01:59.360> kind<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.720> issue<00:01:59.930> when<00:02:00.350> you're<00:02:00.530> placing

the phone inside your case and really

the phone inside your case and really
there<00:02:03.200> isn't<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:04.040> just<00:02:04.280> snap<00:02:04.550> in<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.970> top

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
there isn't you just snap in the top

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.990 
there isn't you just snap in the top
bottom<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:05.990> voila<00:02:06.410> you're<00:02:06.770> done<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.820> leaves

all<00:02:08.209> your<00:02:08.360> ports<00:02:08.660> open<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.619> easily

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
all your ports open so you can easily

the<00:02:15.230> bottom<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.830> headphone<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.550> charging

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
the bottom for headphone and charging

the bottom for headphone and charging
and<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:18.200> guess<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.709> top<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.100> an<00:02:19.220> additional

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and I guess I'm the top is an additional

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.280 
and I guess I'm the top is an additional
microphone<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.540> think<00:02:20.840> something<00:02:21.140> else

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
microphone and I think something else

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.070 
microphone and I think something else
but<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.770> shouldn't<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.480> anyways<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
but I shouldn't know anyways there is a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080 
but I shouldn't know anyways there is a
good<00:02:24.470> amount<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.920> grip<00:02:25.190> although<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
good amount of grip although it is a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.570 
good amount of grip although it is a
matte<00:02:26.510> finish<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.680> feel<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.010> you're

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
matte finish so if you feel that you're

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.699 
matte finish so if you feel that you're
used<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.510> something<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.870> has<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.290> little<00:02:30.620> bit

silicon or something like that this

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.530

or loose parts or anything like that but

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.539 
or loose parts or anything like that but
obviously<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:39.440> not<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:39.769> we<00:03:39.799> drop<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> phone

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
obviously that's not how we drop a phone

obviously that's not how we drop a phone
so<00:03:41.350> let's<00:03:42.350> drop<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.769> waist<00:03:43.010> height<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.610> its

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
so let's drop it waist height on its

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.030 
so let's drop it waist height on its
side

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
especially when I'm looking at it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.330

because I feel like that when I'm

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.550 
because I feel like that when I'm
looking<00:04:26.730> at<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.000> case<00:04:27.210> there's<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.810> chunk<00:04:28.350> of

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
looking at the case there's a chunk of

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.040 
looking at the case there's a chunk of
the<00:04:28.710> case<00:04:28.950> missing<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.300> look<00:04:30.570> at<00:04:30.690> it<00:04:30.810> closer

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
the case missing and I look at it closer

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.970 
the case missing and I look at it closer
like<00:04:31.440> oh<00:04:31.700> that's<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.940> design<00:04:33.330> it's<00:04:34.050> something

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
like oh that's a design it's something

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.880 
like oh that's a design it's something
you<00:04:35.130> get<00:04:35.310> used<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.760> overtime<00:04:36.480> but<00:04:37.140> even<00:04:37.350> doing

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
you get used to overtime but even doing

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.850 
you get used to overtime but even doing
this<00:04:38.010> review<00:04:38.460> right<00:04:38.640> now<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:39.750> made<00:04:40.350> me<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:40.830> a

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
this review right now it made me do a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.580 
this review right now it made me do a
double<00:04:41.310> take<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.060> few<00:04:42.090> times<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:42.810> that's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
double take just a few times so that's

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.250 
double take just a few times so that's
really<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:44.100> perception<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.750> preference

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
really a perception and a preference

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.800 
really a perception and a preference
which<00:04:46.650> i<00:04:46.770> guess<00:04:46.980> is<00:04:47.010> why<00:04:47.370> having<00:04:47.850> case<00:04:48.300> options

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
which i guess is why having case options

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.770 
which i guess is why having case options
is<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> good<00:04:49.320> thing<00:04:49.530> but<00:04:50.340> yeah<00:04:50.640> it's<00:04:51.120> not<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.480> bad

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
is a good thing but yeah it's not a bad

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.070 
is a good thing but yeah it's not a bad

silicon itself the TPU itself will

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.240 
silicon itself the TPU itself will
absorb<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.660> shock<00:05:15.690> hey<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.440> know<00:05:16.740> what<00:05:16.919> that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
absorb the shock hey you know what that

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.610 
absorb the shock hey you know what that
might<00:05:17.520> be<00:05:17.790> true<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.360> know<00:05:18.600> I'm<00:05:18.840> not<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.020> scientist

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
might be true I know I'm not a scientist

might be true I know I'm not a scientist
I<00:05:19.890> don't<00:05:20.100> know<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.490> exact<00:05:21.470> chemical

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
I don't know the exact chemical

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.909 
I don't know the exact chemical
imbalance<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.660> all<00:05:24.990> that<00:05:25.200> other<00:05:25.320> stuff<00:05:25.440> like

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
imbalance and all that other stuff like

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.920 
imbalance and all that other stuff like
how<00:05:26.100> that<00:05:26.160> really<00:05:26.669> works<00:05:27.000> but<00:05:27.390> what<00:05:27.540> I<00:05:27.570> do<00:05:27.690> know

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
how that really works but what I do know

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.440 
how that really works but what I do know
is<00:05:28.169> when<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.710> drop<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.310> phone<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.970> don't<00:05:30.210> really

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
is when I drop the phone I don't really

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.070 
is when I drop the phone I don't really
have<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:31.320> worry<00:05:31.350> about<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:32.070> whatsoever<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:33.450> I
