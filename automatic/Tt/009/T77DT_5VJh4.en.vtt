00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.051
You all right?

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:28.076
Great, aye.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.093
I thought you weren't in today?

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.512
Aye, well... I wasn't, but I am now.

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:43.040
Yeah...

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:46.207
Just the small wreath, thanks.

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:49.804
Message?

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:53.133
Just...

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.503
"I'm sorry."

00:00:58.256 --> 00:00:59.927
No. No name.

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:02.196
Thanks.

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:13.905
Thanks. I'll pay you back later.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.227
No bother. So, who was it?

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.672
That died?

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.450
Just someone from home.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.299
Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.298
No. It's fine.

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:28.754
I know how hard it is.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.058
You wish you could just turn the clock back.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.501
Undo everything.

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.856
Make it good again.

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:39.448
Aye.

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:42.759
Sorry, am I interrupting you?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.175
That's Stella again.

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:54.994
I'll get her later.

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:03.921
"Take one for the team" - aye, right!

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:06.469
Will and Robbie aren't even here yet.

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.080
Sorry, I need to go again.

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:15.431
Wow! That's some costume, Kelly Marie!

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.367
One thing's for sure...

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:19.704
You're not going to need to blow
a whistle to attract attention.

00:02:23.158 --> 00:02:23.968
Hi.

00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:35.395
Hello, ladies.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:45.739
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the warm up will be led by...

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.032
Believe it or not...

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:50.964
Molly O'Hara!

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:33.115
Hello, everyone!

00:03:33.448 --> 00:03:42.310
And a big thank you for turning out today
in all these numbers and all these
wonderfully inventive costumes.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:43.397
Well done.

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:50.239
As you know, we're running today in aid of this charity.
Which is very close to our hearts.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.702
I'm sure you hope we make a great deal of money.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:56.592
All right. Malcolm, your turn.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640
On your marks...

00:03:58.675 --> 00:03:59.778
Get set...

00:04:49.574 --> 00:04:50.802
I think that's the race gone off.

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:55.500
Listen...

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.680
Why don't you go and watch the race?

00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:59.458
Is Christina no' doing it?

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:00.643
I was going to valet that car.

00:05:00.678 --> 00:05:01.618
Please.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:03.978
Just go.

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:04.099
Molly O'Hara.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.345
One R.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.962
This is my grand wean, you know!

00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:09.614
I don't think I look old enough, do I?
