obviously 3 &amp; 4
you've<00:01:28.950> only<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.670> set<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you've only really got one set of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.260 
you've only really got one set of
controls<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.690> 5<00:01:31.290> &amp;<00:01:31.470> 6<00:01:31.790> again<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.000> set<00:01:33.180> of

controls for that channel channels 1 &amp; 2

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.340 
controls for that channel channels 1 &amp; 2
probably<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.770> aimed<00:01:37.980> at<00:01:38.900> mono<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.140> mic

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.900 
inputs or instrument imports and here
you've<00:01:42.660> got<00:01:42.870> an<00:01:43.080> individual<00:01:43.670> input<00:01:44.670> gain

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
you've got an individual input gain

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.950 
you've got an individual input gain
level<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> channel<00:01:46.640> look<00:01:47.640> meter<00:01:48.210> high

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
level panning left and right so you can

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
level panning left and right so you can
alter<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.460> where<00:01:56.910> it<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.150> in<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:57.960> mix

area tells you if you actually overdrive
in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> channel<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.480> reduce<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
in the channel so you can reduce the

in the channel so you can reduce the
gain<00:02:07.050> input<00:02:09.019> what<00:02:10.019> else<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.319> got

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799

looking at the back of it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.289 
looking at the back of it
one<00:02:14.280> thing<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.519> notice<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.939> you<00:02:15.000> pick<00:02:15.209> this

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
one thing you notice when you pick this

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.720 
one thing you notice when you pick this
thing<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.659> built<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.989> friggin<00:02:16.439> tank<00:02:16.739> you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
thing it's built like a friggin tank you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.460 
thing it's built like a friggin tank you
tape<00:02:18.150> inputs<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:18.750> sorry<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:19.170> upside<00:02:19.260> down

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
tape inputs there sorry it's upside down

and<00:02:20.099> your<00:02:20.340> USB<00:02:20.640> important<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.269> power<00:02:21.480> input

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
and your USB important the power input

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.069 
and your USB important the power input
in<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.900> switch<00:02:22.310> that's<00:02:23.310> pretty<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.420> mean

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
in a switch that's pretty much it I mean

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.809
