00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.410
 hello friends i'm sergey sibertsev 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.030
 fitness and sports specialists 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.470
 turnout site note past 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.330
 there are things that are obvious to me but 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.849
 this is incomprehensible to many people 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.979
 for example, I was surprised when I became often with 

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.659
 seal the question of how to pump up to beat 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.339
 using push ups 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.949
 man's body is pretty 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.980
 complicated 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.750
 and often novice athletes do not understand 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.900
 how does it work 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.670
 and what muscles are involved in the work 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.490
 under certain holiday 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.340
 so on my site the answer is gov.ru 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.930
 I post many tutorials 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.490
 and video lessons 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.220
 I tried to tell difficult 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.140
 things in simple words to boost 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.520
 level of your knowledge 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.570
 today answering the question of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 is it possible using push up from the floor 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 pump your biceps 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.910
 benitez is the muscles that touch the arm 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.700
 elbow joint 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 and also from turning 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 forearm out 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 These are the two main functions of Vitebsk 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.680
 Benitez are active in those 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.610
 exercises where required with effort 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.010
 with one goal in total 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.120
 and turn the forearm outward 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 with the greatest intensity 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 most components 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.880
 business running 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.180
 during the festival hands with unfolded 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.010
 forearm 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.040
 and his Biden trips to Kiev with 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.380
 simultaneous reversal 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 forearm was 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.040
 that's why special 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.610
 pizza exercises 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.780
 these are various rub festivals 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.110
 with dumbbells or with a barbell 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.040
 for example here the ram's horn 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.050
 formulations standing 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.000
 during pregnancy fell hands 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.260
 for a short time 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.280
 with simultaneous reversal of the forearm 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.370
 on the street 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.889
 here they are now 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.949
 called biceps brachii 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.350
 precipitations around the world kirk elbow joint 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.719
 called shooting and forearm 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.129
 anatomical tongue is slightly different from 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 colloquial 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.919
 so biceps work great in 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.939
 various theaters stand by theaters on 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:29.770
 simulators 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.579
 and just pull up 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.509
 because in these exercises for sure 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.999
 also required with great effort in winter 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.919
 elbow joints 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.539
 miner pulling them up 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.919
 business and work great together with 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.349
 russian backs 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.059
 look at the gymnasts 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.769
 they don't make special 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.130
 exercise fill stocks 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.059
 during this time from Astana 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.259
 but at the same time they have very good thoughts 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.229
 developed selection walked amount 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.229
 drag on the crossbar 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.039
 now let's deal with their desire 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.699
 during germany in studying trying 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.139
 services will take hands to raise their 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.629
 hall body 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.719
 that is, you need to develop efforts 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.029
 to refuse him in the arm and elbow 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:14.959
 joint 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.369
 movement occurs simultaneously 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.069
 shoulder 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.229
 at the same time 37 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.669
 which time debate galactichos arm whiskers 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.379
 as well as rubles of thoughts 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.549
 and the front of those or other muscles 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.129
 then when troops from iraq to their place 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.999
 bodies 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.530
 same muscles 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.049
 holding back your movements 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.760
 yielding gradually 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.439
 stretched 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.439
 biceps in this work do not differ 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.879
 So push-ups can not work 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.709
 biceps because while living semi 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.919
 with effort 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.479
 you define flour in a suit of baytik elbows 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.359
 joints 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.269
 and the function is seen right 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.459
 opposite 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.919
 here are the baths of the arm and the elbow joint 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.349
 some people say 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.959
 and the euro and drug addiction feel like 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.149
 tense biceps means he trains 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.639
 I can say that with intense 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.329
 hard work in almost any 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.149
 exercise can strain everything 

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.819
 body even face 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.019
 but it does not mean 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.139
 that in this case I will train all these 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.559
 muscles 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.409
 for example while already beckoning also 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.939
 strained legs 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.269
 but this does not mean that push-ups in the 

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.719
 the answer to pump emotions 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.799
 on the occasion of experiencing a great burden they 

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:35.320
 use just for 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.870
 fixing the body in a certain 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.370
 position 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.070
 Similarly, months can be 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.389
 tense in different exercises 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.360
 but they use them as an auxiliary 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.259
 muscles 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.050
 but in order to stabilize the arms 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.050
 in a certain position 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.700
 in fact if you want to achieve 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.849
 after good results 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.680
 not to dream too 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320
 and use the right 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.060
 training programs which 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.219
 made up of specialists 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.619
 quote.ru has a tutorial on my site 

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:08.380

 video tutorials that will help you
