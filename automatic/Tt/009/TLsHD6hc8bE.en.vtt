00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.270
 hi of the world 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.279
 these gones were so true we get 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.439
 find for one or rather a tutorial very 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.199
 expected since a lot of people have me 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 asked for a tutorial on the effects of 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.040
 colors that I did in the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.769
 graffiti so that's so today 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 is going to be this tutorial so has it all so 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.170
 first I will show you several 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 two number methods that I do 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.299
 so the first is simply 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.970
 so degrade it so I will make you 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.180
 this with so it's saying too much there so 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.799
 so here at the denounced level the file 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:03.409
 green the grace and the boys would he me 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:05.390
 seems so I'm going to show you so the 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.159
 degrade it is pretty simple so it's 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.409
 always a French golf has a 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.060
 lighter color so especially so 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.020
 there I'm going to start the color more 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.550
 dark down there so we spend a 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.510
 first layer of veyron it's all in 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.060
 down like this do not hesitate to iron 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.280
 several times to leave the foot 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 quite humid it is very convenient to 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.340
 level of the graded nose to then have 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.790
 our fade so here we go all of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.659
 then he second layer so of the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.750
 second glass on top so the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.060
 first what clearly appears that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.520
 the fade so there we start to 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:57.320
 see a beginning to degrade then 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.770
 we pass quickly a little layer by 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.280
 on it take limited 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.710
 and there we see that we are starting to see 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 a nice gradient 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:14.980
 so here we continue like these 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 follow immediately with the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.890
 third to a drink that I appreciate 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.890
 a lot 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:30.010
 so we always iron a thin layer 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.560
 over the previous one to give this 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.349
 degrading effect that we will get 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.200
 we always go back a second layer 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.540
 of glass actually by ironing a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.239
 second layer of glass the two 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.519
 imbued colors get confused have of 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 blow is what will allow to 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.040
 degrade 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.739
 so there we do not hesitate so here I am 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.720
 will enlarge the space of the light green on 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.430
 will make you see I live ranks so 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.459
 so here is where you can observe 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.109
 so we can not wait dark green until 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.680
 light green so with a whole 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.549
 progression so it works for all 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.069
 the different colors 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.200
 of course so here I am going to show you 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.910
 a second method so this one that 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.209
 I use more often in my 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:29.400
 graphs since I have a lot of shaded seen 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:32.000
 what I rarely use 3d so 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.220
 here 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.880
 so always a little to delineate 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:43.700
 what tools here is the shave surprises me 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.890
 so we will take our candy colors 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.760
 change we will take something other than the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.970
 glass or go for example a blue these 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.980
 blue there so it's the cian so we're going 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.120
 so browse the color that goes 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:06.459
 color so the color that we 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:06.459
 interested here 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.759
 so here is then the part the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.940
 more interesting 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:26.030
 it is this so pro marker has it so that there 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.580
 so do in fact if this marc collat ​​which 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.410
 will allow us to shade 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.680
 pinching we will bring the shadow of this 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.550
 side there so we're all going to shadow who's going 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.610
 to get here 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:45.370
 so if we apply immediately a 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:45.370
 layer makes two cries has it slightly 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:58.480
 like these we can iron a little 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.480
 blue over it here 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.110
 so here we go 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.760
 So here we see that there is 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.920
 the shadow on that side so convince the 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.960
 gray will allow background this is the 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.750
 color which is our base in fact the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.740
 basic color that has been applied 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.720
 so it was a guy the features 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.880
 I really approve what she and not 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.190
 allows to do a lot number at the level 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.530
 graphs as I superimposes good 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.170
 lettering 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.420
 so that's it again I was asked 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.420
 also so how do I get to do so 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.700
 gradients but multiple colors 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.530
 so there especially I made a range of 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.910
 glasses but I can make the negroes 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:55.350
 was born in many colors including 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:57.810
 the one guy I was proposing to uncle carmine 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.540
 a color that I was going super beautiful 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.950
 what I use a lot in my graphs 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:07.100
 so that color and and the rape 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.540
 were the music 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.670
 so these are two colors downright 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.660
 opposite and I make you look a 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.550
 gradient of these two colors there so 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.850
 it's not complicated it's exactly the 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:25.760
 same technique as the first one so we 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:32.190
 will apply a good layer of carmine 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:34.920
 so there then we always do it again 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:40.730
 like this then we always apply a 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.730
 little layer on the edge of the first 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:49.400
 like this one he does not hesitate to 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.180
 iron each time and 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.360
 gradually 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:59.449
 I was going to see that we will get a 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.900
 color squarely mix between the 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:06.620
 purple and the carmine look just at 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:10.729
 middle one has a sister of a rose a man 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.560
 pretty clear that's how we go 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.919
 to make a gradient of colors 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:20.719
 So that's where you've seen us go 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.800
 from purple to so it works with 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.839
 any color 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.979
 of course you have to avoid 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:29.719
 colors quite dark because a color 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:33.830
 darker will dominate on a color 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:35.810
 clear this everybody knows so he 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.860
 there are several so couple of colors that 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.389
 go beautiful together that I can you 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:45.050
 so propose especially these two 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:47.839
 colors there are the chestnuts that have 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.479
 very well with oranje also after 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:52.039
 good it's up to you to see what you 

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.509
 want to do that test yourself one is 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.669
 like me I'm all always having a 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:57.439
 little sheet next to me that serves me 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:01.039
 palettes for me to do small tests 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:04.189
 and see if I like it or not and that's it 

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:05.930
 So what we have least it was good 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:07.339
 from an early pointy so the colors 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.990
 I hope I have answered all your 

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:11.060
 questions and we end up for the 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.659
 next time for a new tutorial at the 

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.659
 end of lease
