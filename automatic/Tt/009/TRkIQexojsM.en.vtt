00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
wanted to go take a look at something

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
wanted to go take a look at something
let's<00:00:54.960> say<00:00:55.050> office<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.829> tap<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.430> straight<00:00:56.730> in

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
let's say office just tap go straight in

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.479 
let's say office just tap go straight in
and<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> concept

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and what we have here is a concept

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
and what we have here is a concept
called<00:00:59.640> panoramas<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.840> means<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> you're

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
called panoramas which means that you're

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
called panoramas which means that you're
able<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> slide<00:01:02.039> across<00:01:02.190> different<00:01:02.910> panes<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
able to slide across different panes and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
able to slide across different panes and
so<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> visual<00:01:04.589> hints<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so a visual hints that kind of go to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
so a visual hints that kind of go to
this<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> OneNote<00:01:06.600> yup<00:01:07.439> take<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> look<00:01:07.770> at
