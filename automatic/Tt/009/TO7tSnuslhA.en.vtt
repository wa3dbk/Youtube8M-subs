the first chem that I got in ghosts
which<00:00:20.430> was<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.960> video<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.260> probably<00:00:22.470> two

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
which was this video is probably two

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
which was this video is probably two
months<00:00:23.070> old<00:00:23.220> by<00:00:23.430> now<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.150> haven't<00:00:24.630> had

months old by now but I just haven't had
time<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:26.519> upload<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> yet<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.449> thought<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
time to to upload it yet so I thought I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.589 
time to to upload it yet so I thought I
would<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> quick<00:00:29.010> commentary<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.760> upload

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
would do a quick commentary and upload

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
would do a quick commentary and upload

as<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.520> month<00:01:11.760> ago

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
as of one month ago

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
as of one month ago
it<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:14.010> combo<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it was a really really good combo I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
it was a really really good combo I
don't<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.439> they've<00:01:16.590> made<00:01:16.770> any<00:01:16.830> updates

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
don't know if they've made any updates

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.359 
don't know if they've made any updates
to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> game<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.299> nerfed<00:01:19.369> footsteps

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to the game and like nerfed footsteps

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
to the game and like nerfed footsteps
but<00:01:20.810> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.409> point<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.979> gameplay<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
but at the point of this gameplay the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.320 
but at the point of this gameplay the
footsteps<00:01:24.150> were<00:01:24.360> quite<00:01:25.049> audible<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:26.330> great

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
footsteps were quite audible at great

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
footsteps were quite audible at great
distances<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.400> anyways<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
distances actually so anyways this is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719 
distances actually so anyways this is
the<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:31.079> cam<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.009> cod<00:01:32.220> ghosts

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the first cam that I got in cod ghosts

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.810 
the first cam that I got in cod ghosts
and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.689> wasn't<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:35.159> aiming<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and I actually wasn't really aiming to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
and I actually wasn't really aiming to
get<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> chem<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
get a chem this game like I was kind of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
get a chem this game like I was kind of
surprised<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> actually<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
surprised when I actually got the the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.649 
surprised when I actually got the the
Kem<00:01:40.140> strike<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:42.000> using<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.390> salt

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
Kem strike because I'm using the salt

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
Kem strike because I'm using the salt
layout<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:44.009> wasn't<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.579> paying

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
layout here and I wasn't really paying

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.190 
layout here and I wasn't really paying
attention<00:01:44.970> through<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.509> streak<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.020> did

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
attention through my streak like I did

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
attention through my streak like I did
notice<00:01:46.470> at<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:46.890> point<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> 40

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
notice at some point that I was on a 40

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.490 
notice at some point that I was on a 40
kill<00:01:48.180> streak<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> hadn't<00:01:48.930> gotten<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.200> account

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
kill streak and hadn't gotten an account

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.639 
kill streak and hadn't gotten an account
yet<00:01:49.790> but<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.939> didn't<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.509> cross<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.619> mind

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
yet but it didn't really cross my mind

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
yet but it didn't really cross my mind
that<00:01:53.040> much<00:01:53.189> until<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.270> saw<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> kill

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that much until I actually saw the kill

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
that much until I actually saw the kill
streak<00:01:55.110> coming<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> screen<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.310> this

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
streak coming up on the screen so this

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.920 
streak coming up on the screen so this
guy<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.670> exciting<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> first<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.750> light

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
guy I'm exciting is the first can light

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
guy I'm exciting is the first can light
on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.229> game<00:01:58.409> since<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.340> have

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
on the game since then I think I have

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
on the game since then I think I have
gotten<00:02:00.090> another<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.600> 5<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:00.869> 6<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.070> said

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
gotten another like 5 or 6 but as I said

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
gotten another like 5 or 6 but as I said
I<00:02:02.310> haven't<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.090> played<00:02:03.420> much<00:02:03.750> much<00:02:04.320> Call

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I haven't really played much much Call

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
I haven't really played much much Call

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'll probably start playing a bunch more

I'll probably start playing a bunch more
and<00:02:19.450> uploading<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.050> bunch<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.320> more<00:02:20.470> videos<00:02:20.740> but

and uploading a bunch of more videos but
in<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> meantime<00:02:21.460> I'm<00:02:21.790> gonna<00:02:21.940> try<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> upload

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
in the meantime I'm gonna try to upload

in the meantime I'm gonna try to upload
some<00:02:24.340> videos<00:02:24.370> before<00:02:25.210> then<00:02:25.390> I'm<00:02:26.050> actually

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
some videos before then I'm actually

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.900 
some videos before then I'm actually
recording<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.710> right<00:02:26.920> now<00:02:27.070> or<00:02:27.460> not

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
recording this right now or not

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.980 
recording this right now or not
recording<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.510> making<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.840> video

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
recording but I'm making this video

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.970 
recording but I'm making this video
right<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.560> using<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:30.280> MacBook<00:02:30.670> Air<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
right now using a MacBook Air so it

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.050 
right now using a MacBook Air so it
might<00:02:33.160> look<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.430> little<00:02:33.460> different<00:02:33.640> I'm<00:02:34.030> not

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
might look a little different I'm not

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.290 
might look a little different I'm not
using<00:02:34.420> using<00:02:35.110> my<00:02:35.230> usual<00:02:35.740> setup<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:37.150> actually

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
using using my usual setup I'm actually

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.720 
using using my usual setup I'm actually
quite<00:02:37.540> interested<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.020> see<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:39.280> how<00:02:39.580> this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
quite interested to see what how this

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.040 
quite interested to see what how this
turns<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.330> how<00:02:40.480> long<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.750> takes<00:02:40.930> to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
turns out like how long it takes to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
turns out like how long it takes to
render<00:02:41.200> maybe<00:02:41.530> Apple<00:02:41.740> has<00:02:42.040> some<00:02:42.280> sort<00:02:42.460> of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
render maybe Apple has some sort of

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.270 
render maybe Apple has some sort of
black<00:02:42.760> magic<00:02:42.970> they<00:02:43.270> use<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.630> make<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> not<00:02:44.050> take

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
black magic they use to make it not take

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.580 
black magic they use to make it not take
four<00:02:45.280> hours<00:02:45.310> seen<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.390> has<00:02:46.600> got<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
four hours seen as this has got like a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.370 
four hours seen as this has got like a
laptop<00:02:48.010> CPU<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> nobody<00:02:49.600> at<00:02:49.660> Acadia<00:02:49.870> graphics

or<00:02:50.530> anything<00:02:50.680> like<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:52.450> when<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.660> render

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
or anything like that like when I render

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.380 
or anything like that like when I render
on<00:02:53.140> my<00:02:53.320> desktop<00:02:53.740> with<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> gtx<00:02:55.030> 680<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.690> i<00:02:57.390> 535

know<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.430> we'll<00:03:10.030> see<00:03:10.180> how<00:03:10.210> long<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.510> takes<00:03:10.540> on

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
know but we'll see how long it takes on

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.570 
know but we'll see how long it takes on
the<00:03:10.900> MacBook<00:03:11.050> I'm<00:03:11.350> quite<00:03:11.500> interested<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.070> see

haven't bothered me that much you know
there's<00:03:33.760> not<00:03:33.910> too<00:03:33.970> many<00:03:34.300> problems<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.720> the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
there's not too many problems of the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.300 
there's not too many problems of the
game<00:03:34.900> there's<00:03:35.080> a<00:03:35.140> VI<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.830> chemistry<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.130> was

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
game there's a VI that chemistry I was

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.440 
game there's a VI that chemistry I was
kind<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.459> surprised<00:03:36.700> but<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:37.060> think<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.390> was

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
kind of surprised but I think it was

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.720 
kind of surprised but I think it was
like<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.780> dog<00:03:38.110> or<00:03:38.410> something<00:03:38.830> or<00:03:38.980> helicopter

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
like the dog or something or helicopter

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.150 
like the dog or something or helicopter

like how did I even get that kill or no

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.010 
like how did I even get that kill or no
actually<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.550> think<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.970> got<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> kill<00:03:43.630> streak<00:03:43.720> and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020

actually I think I got a kill streak and
then<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:44.410> showed<00:03:44.590> up<00:03:44.740> after<00:03:45.220> because<00:03:45.730> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
then that just showed up after because I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.940 
then that just showed up after because I
got<00:03:46.240> the<00:03:46.390> helicopter<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.959> then<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.200> cam<00:03:47.380> but

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
yeah I was kind of surprised by that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.170 
yeah I was kind of surprised by that
excited<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:51.040> course<00:03:51.520> now<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.030> I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
excited to and then of course now that I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.390 
excited to and then of course now that I
have<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.420> camera<00:03:52.570> like<00:03:52.780> oh<00:03:52.840> my<00:03:52.959> god<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.400> panic

have the camera like oh my god and panic

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.420 
have the camera like oh my god and panic
and<00:03:54.610> end<00:03:54.850> up<00:03:54.970> dying<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.650> few<00:03:56.890> moments<00:03:57.220> here

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
and end up dying in a few moments here

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.420 
and end up dying in a few moments here
but<00:03:58.620> yeah<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.830> most<00:03:59.980> part<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.220> games

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
but yeah for the most part this games

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.160 
but yeah for the most part this games
been<00:04:00.520> pretty<00:04:01.060> good<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.360> me<00:04:01.600> like<00:04:01.810> I've<00:04:01.930> gotten

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
been pretty good to me like I've gotten

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.750 
been pretty good to me like I've gotten
a<00:04:02.320> couple<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.560> cam<00:04:02.770> strikes<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.280> like<00:04:03.459> using<00:04:03.640> a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
a couple of cam strikes I like using a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.420 
a couple of cam strikes I like using a
bunch<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.090> different<00:04:04.180> weapons<00:04:05.130> assault<00:04:06.130> I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
bunch of different weapons assault I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.300 
bunch of different weapons assault I
find<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.000> be<00:04:07.410> relatively<00:04:08.410> useless<00:04:08.860> like<00:04:09.160> it's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
find to be relatively useless like it's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.400 
find to be relatively useless like it's
not<00:04:09.400> overpowered<00:04:10.090> in<00:04:10.239> any<00:04:10.390> way<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.840> none<00:04:11.380> of

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
not overpowered in any way and none of

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.800 
not overpowered in any way and none of
the<00:04:11.560> kill<00:04:12.010> streaks<00:04:12.220> are<00:04:12.340> really<00:04:12.520> that<00:04:12.700> fun<00:04:13.540> to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
the kill streaks are really that fun to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.440 
the kill streaks are really that fun to
use<00:04:14.020> like<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.680> really<00:04:15.430> enjoyed<00:04:15.700> using<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
use like I really enjoyed using the the

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.909 
use like I really enjoyed using the the
Reaper<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.989> lodestar<00:04:17.410> that's<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.709> really

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
Reaper in the lodestar that's a really

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.390 
Reaper in the lodestar that's a really
fun<00:04:18.190> kill<00:04:18.430> streak<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.850> use<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:19.830> yeah<00:04:20.830> I<00:04:20.890> find

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
fun kill streak to use but yeah I find

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.530 
fun kill streak to use but yeah I find
most<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.729> kill<00:04:21.880> streaks<00:04:22.150> like<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
most of the kill streaks like the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.510 
most of the kill streaks like the
assault<00:04:22.720> kill<00:04:22.930> streaks<00:04:23.169> are<00:04:23.520> relatively

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
assault kill streaks are relatively

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.040 
assault kill streaks are relatively
useless<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.150> not<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.390> entertaining

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
useless and not that entertaining

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.629 
useless and not that entertaining
and<00:04:26.199> I<00:04:26.349> really<00:04:26.860> really<00:04:27.009> don't<00:04:27.280> like<00:04:27.400> this

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
and I really really don't like this

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.360 
and I really really don't like this
orange<00:04:28.030> glow<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.690> Kem<00:04:29.590> strike<00:04:29.770> puts<00:04:30.250> on

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
orange glow that the Kem strike puts on

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.189 
orange glow that the Kem strike puts on
the<00:04:30.460> map<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.789> find<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.090> makes<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.990> very

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
the map I find it makes it very

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.830 
the map I find it makes it very
difficult<00:04:32.319> to<00:04:32.889> see<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.940> anything<00:04:34.479> that's

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
difficult to see like anything that's

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.100 
difficult to see like anything that's
not<00:04:35.080> ten<00:04:35.379> feet<00:04:35.560> in<00:04:35.620> front<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.069> so<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:37.330> don't

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
not ten feet in front of you so I don't

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.300 
not ten feet in front of you so I don't
like<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.349> I<00:04:38.409> should<00:04:38.560> have<00:04:38.650> saved<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.949> chem<00:04:39.129> to

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
like it I should have saved the chem to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.439 
like it I should have saved the chem to
the<00:04:39.400> end<00:04:39.520> but<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:39.970> know<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.210> my<00:04:40.270> first

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
the end but you know it's my first

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.040 
the end but you know it's my first
chemistry<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.500> was<00:04:42.039> all<00:04:42.159> just<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.699> know

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
chemistry so I was all just you know

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.010 
chemistry so I was all just you know
wanted<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.139> call<00:04:44.289> it<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:46.419> only<00:04:46.599> thing<00:04:46.870> that

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
wanted to call it in the only thing that

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.200 
wanted to call it in the only thing that
really<00:04:47.680> really<00:04:48.009> gets<00:04:48.280> on<00:04:48.430> my<00:04:48.580> nerves<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.090> this

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
really really gets on my nerves in this

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.020 
really really gets on my nerves in this
game<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:49.509> other<00:04:49.690> than<00:04:49.949> then<00:04:50.949> like<00:04:51.400> really

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
game like other than then like really

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.540 
game like other than then like really
hardcore<00:04:52.659> camping<00:04:52.930> which<00:04:53.319> does<00:04:54.069> happen

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
hardcore camping which does happen

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.580 
hardcore camping which does happen
because<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.599> know<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:56.169> can't<00:04:56.409> really

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
because you know you can't really

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.700 
because you know you can't really
control<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:58.000> guess<00:04:58.930> like<00:04:59.110> I've<00:04:59.229> seen<00:04:59.440> in

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
control that I guess like I've seen in

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.219 
control that I guess like I've seen in
some<00:04:59.740> like<00:05:00.520> modded<00:05:00.909> lobbyists<00:05:01.389> or<00:05:01.509> private

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
some like modded lobbyists or private

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.399 
some like modded lobbyists or private
servers<00:05:02.530> or<00:05:02.680> whatever<00:05:03.330> people<00:05:04.330> do<00:05:04.690> anti<00:05:05.080> camp

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
servers or whatever people do anti camp

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.930 
servers or whatever people do anti camp
timers<00:05:05.979> so<00:05:06.250> if<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.400> stand<00:05:06.639> in<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.759> same<00:05:06.880> spot

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
timers so if you stand in the same spot

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.749 
timers so if you stand in the same spot
for<00:05:07.389> more<00:05:07.509> than<00:05:07.630> ten<00:05:07.780> seconds<00:05:08.199> like<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.490> die

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
for more than ten seconds like you die

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.969 
for more than ten seconds like you die
it<00:05:10.270> gives<00:05:10.569> you<00:05:10.659> a<00:05:10.690> warning<00:05:10.960> like<00:05:11.139> stop<00:05:11.530> camping

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
it gives you a warning like stop camping

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.370 
it gives you a warning like stop camping
and<00:05:12.190> then<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.550> timer<00:05:13.210> goes<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.780> then<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.199> die

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
and then a timer goes and then you die

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.230 
and then a timer goes and then you die
if<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:14.740> don't<00:05:14.919> move<00:05:15.009> around<00:05:15.190> but<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.090> know

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
if you don't move around but you know

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.399 
if you don't move around but you know
that's<00:05:16.389> that's<00:05:16.659> still<00:05:16.810> kind<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:16.990> broken

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
that's that's still kind of broken

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:18.899 
that's that's still kind of broken
because<00:05:17.590> people<00:05:17.919> can<00:05:18.130> just<00:05:18.310> like<00:05:18.490> move<00:05:18.729> from

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
because people can just like move from
