00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Nine people terrors here and I have in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.259
 last mp3 video cut that up 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.189
 in the process of trying it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
 hinzubekommen 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 and yes one day later, so I still have 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.570
 finally managed and the gameplay could 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.449
 Now look at this and that just mine 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.939
 first livermore with the l 118 but if 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 you me is why and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.600
 Surprisingly , especially me 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.800
 the whole life on the map bootleg 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 succeeded what actually anyway 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 no sniper map is actually with it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.650
 calculated that me somehow 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.469
 succeed so successful cars interchange 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.670
 such maps but yes bootleg was already 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.260
 surprise but think well anyway 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.550
 to look at is of course a bit longer 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 the street because I'm really not good 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.300
 can cut and it can be on everyone 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.469
 case and you see from that, I ask 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270
 I still like me today 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.590
 have done 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 by the way, by the way, with the theater 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 therefore, do not be surprised 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.399
 if the hit action is sometimes a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.539
 it is still a bit strange 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.760
 you can see quite well that me 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.370
 sometimes really bad and miss 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.350
 so very strange and everything 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.780
 any case not so my metier you have 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.290
 already noticed that lead 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.299
 Strangely , I have it anyway 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.680
 and I want that already 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.630
 anticipate I have on the stream5 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 kills made with my mp 9 and one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.189
 child my knife but after that I have 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.900
 four more on my street 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.909
 after I got the guy 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
 her four more remains from there 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 I think nobody should be there 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.030
 I can complain that I have too many kids 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.790
 but I did with other weapons 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.990
 At least I did it and now 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.329
 actually there is not so much to so 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.750
 Of course, standard poor s tell for 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.640
 pull me nimble integrated quickly at 19 and 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.180
 master marksman and then as extras 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 calm hand assassin and hardliner and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.070
 then stop the expand magazine and im 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.030
 speed I think on the understandable 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.409
 sniper or one fits that already 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.880
 and yes I play when I'm on the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.259
 sixth stage actually pretty 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.909
 low where they say i believe that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 Most snipers are already playing at eight 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.430
 or so it is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.110
 It does not really itch me to play 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.720
 65 safer because the games 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.489
 usually on a four is already 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.069
 class change for me to 6 suddenly 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.300
 to play with the sniper and then it fits 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.989
 That's it and you definitely see 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.489
 on gameplay that I have a hartz iv oper 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.370
 the finest So am I really 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.590
 There are no problems with it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.830
 many sniper follow me 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.810
 unofficial codecs or something 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.940
 unofficial unwritten laws 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.620
 it was only quick schopen may only notes 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 may and only harzburg and so 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890
 must say further than me if I am 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860
 Neppe then I'll do it on the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.269
 as effective as possible if that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.209
 consider myself my secondary 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.380
 raushole or my hard times scope 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.299
 in a few seconds long then I have 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.640
 so no problem at all and makes 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.680
 that without problems happy and who with it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.330
 a problem has all but yes because of me 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.530
 honestly i find the ridiculous 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.670
 sometimes these rules when you have time 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.420
 meanwhile prevailed 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.400
 somehow these standards when cutting 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.560
 has developed more and more with mw2 that 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.850
 Men started less but good 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.769
 example here the situation even if 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 I come on the hit market with the sniper 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.480
 and then i'll get my second 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.100
 more safety out and then a 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.549
 hit with the second I stop in 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.010
 keel 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.930
 and he fits that and I want more 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 not at all and by the way I have too 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.100
 here is a nice color collection 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.829
 done a bit different from the video 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.470
 standard color collection so how did 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.549
 them have edited image the way 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.540
 again a tight situation 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.069
 I think that's a bit like that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.450
 is a few montage and so on and 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.400
 You want to do that again like that 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 arrives that livermore if so with them 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.690
 there a little wacky color collection 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.370
 to see 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.370
 And that was also such a moral I have to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.489
 say the very surprising came for me 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.200
 because I play against the whole 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.930
 clan or I think five times plan 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.090
 at least and they were already 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.510
 thought oh man than me in the game 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.310
 come 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.410
 It was right at the beginning I can 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.000
 somehow only with 70 points and so on 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.970
 continue into the game 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.920
 that's also the 1 cup match 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.989
 where I just see what you see here 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.819
 can be in gameplay and has been mine 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.160
 thought oh man will be no directly 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.799
 ag and play clearly different races and 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.650
 So on, and still somehow 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.970
 managed and therefore how strange at 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.270
 Normally, most of them are created 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.740
 gameplay against halt mainly 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.360
 people, however, is clear in any case 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.400
 not and you know that so if you eg 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.139
 cod then plays in lobby congo then 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.759
 somehow only splitscreen you just watch 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.199
 with low level people that one 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.360
 right here with your hands are tearing 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.380
 For the first time and maybe one 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.030
 to get the gamepad 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.190
 and that was not here, for example 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.330
 the case because I actually thought first 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.740
 ok, I'll probably be two more 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.389
 Millions again quarreled 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.910
 but still works 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.990
 Surprisingly, and that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.340
 likely that the most 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.979
 Gameplay is always not worth it 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.380
 and actually already completed 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.810
 with the round more or less year old 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.349
 sofas written in monza script four 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.550
 man is missing but what the hell and I have 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.560
 I wonder why the opponents 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.210
 jumped so badly on the flags 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.289
 and I do not know that at all and 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.310
 Accordingly, I have the game on 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.949
 it can already be lost 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.509
 unfortunately I also betrayed on one 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.889
 strict constraints taken but completely 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.210
 honestly we have the flags instant 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.820
 lost if I have taken the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.979
 both jumped without end 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.599
 and all evening I'm only against 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.220
 such people played or only against 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.159
 The clans played at once 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.020
 jump flags and then I am myself 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.650
 had totally wondered next to elite 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.570
 looked in the internet on the cod page 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.820
 elite and then I saw that exactly 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.120
 around the and gambled in the timeframe 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.250
 have in the stately bob that exactly 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.620
 in that in the period was then such a 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.169
 elite challenge where it came 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.610
 somehow as clear most flags 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.870
 domination and I have there 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.070
 nothing at all surprised and there can 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.930
 I do not think I can do anything 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.940
 individual players go the whole clan 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.320
 the only out if possible as many 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.530
 to take flags by possibly 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.169
 small period of therefore against the 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.759
 unfortunately not in our team and me 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.520
 does not like hearings totally 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.380
 wondered that a sniper kill after the 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.550
 first after the first murder children 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.919
 Somehow strange and I was myself 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.360
 not gameplay to show you loses 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.400
 but I am so glad that finally 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.639
 get the nano out and then 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.419
 just before some clear that is 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.590
 I still do not believe so 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.100
 is problematic because I had 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.810
 really tried and 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.990
 we know that too whom he like that 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.110
 to gamble is so good it was to 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.460
 always short comment 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.600
 and maybe we'll have a look 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.680
 I can not do anything else 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.420
 Actually, I had only promise 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.760
 planned to create one and then 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.870
 to be satisfied but maybe pack 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.300
 I'm still another with an essay 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.430
 or so that was the first 230 new 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.900
 fenced later and yes I hope 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.200
 fallen until next time 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.200
 pure skin
