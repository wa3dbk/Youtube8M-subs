00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.730
 Hi there, this is a review and mobile games from 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.910
 mob uay and the microphone as usual 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.829
 depreciation drove today with us very 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.079
 beautiful and high-quality game of the genre 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.060
 which kind of tower defense 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.430
 just the opposite but you are on the side 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.919
 dudes who they go 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.960
 defend they say the first part of the game in 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.629
 time made a lot of noise 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.510
 but of course I slept and played 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.510
 only from the second we meet anomaly 2 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.640
 when I said that the game is quality I 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 didn't mean only good graphics 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
 grafon here is of course at a height but he is not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.929
 figure if you follow my 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.239
 reviews do you know what happens games where with 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.269
 the graphics seem to be fine but here it is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 the game is like an asshole done wrong here 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.579
 everything is cool and graphics and animation 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 interactions of the units are all debugged and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
 works great creating 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 the impression of quality 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.090
 carefully assembled product if 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.549
 In short, I knead this year so in 2018 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.679
 your mother land on chambers some 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 crap from space and game events 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.390
 unfold after our fall 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 races the earth is now icy desert a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.679
 little people and in the minority no longer say 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 for spoilers but about gameplay 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.479
 it is necessary to talk at all he conditionally 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 divided into two components tactical 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.399
 and own tactical part 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 the game is the choice of our route 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.810
 convoy clicking on the appropriate button 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.479
 you get on the cards on this card 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.459
 marked enemies and shown road poke 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.940
 fingers choosing the most profitable 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.129
 route 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.840
 enemies by the way have the property of a sudden 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:50.759
 get out and multiply so 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 you will correct tactics more than once 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.099
 and not two per level game component 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.929
 this is watching your column kill 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.970
 enemies gives money that you can 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.310
 you can buy the maximum technique 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.259
 have six units besides from enemies 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 by give bonuses like first-aid kits and 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.369
 distracting beacons so just 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.769
 passively observe the movement of the column 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.629
 and not have to and every unit has 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.670
 two forms for example will be 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.190
 transform from robot tanks and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.230
 back every form has its advantages and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.480
 cons and here, too, does not hurt 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.540
 tactical if in short the game to me 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.360
 I liked it bright and juicy and with explosions 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.670
 robots alien tentacles and even 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.310
 and to the river you have to think short 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.959
 we play all network mode of course too 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.599
 present so with brahter 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.280
 it will be chopped up today 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.530
