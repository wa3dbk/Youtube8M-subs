tough<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:52.180> pretty<00:00:52.300> simply<00:00:52.720> idea<00:00:53.050> that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
tough but it's pretty simply idea that

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.340

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
at that time pre computers have been

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.110 
at that time pre computers have been
either<00:05:10.319> where<00:05:10.560> we<00:05:11.340> had<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.849> money<00:05:12.000> to

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
either where we had to have the money to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.189 
either where we had to have the money to
to<00:05:13.110> do<00:05:13.259> things<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.520> very<00:05:14.729> beginning

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
to do things so in the very beginning

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.619 
to do things so in the very beginning
the<00:05:16.199> fallout<00:05:16.620> started<00:05:17.069> with<00:05:17.300> what<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.330> wanted

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
the fallout started with what I wanted

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.420 
the fallout started with what I wanted
to<00:05:18.750> do<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.289> would<00:05:19.650> find<00:05:19.979> they<00:05:20.250> had

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
to do and I would find they had

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.240 
to do and I would find they had
production<00:05:20.729> guys<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.270> would<00:05:21.509> say<00:05:21.690> how<00:05:22.620> in

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
production guys that I would say how in

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.240 
production guys that I would say how in
pre-production<00:05:23.610> had<00:05:24.800> something<00:05:25.800> organized

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
pre-production had something organized

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.529 
pre-production had something organized
and<00:05:26.490> I'd<00:05:26.550> go<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:26.759> do<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.090> there<00:05:27.180> was<00:05:27.270> change

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
and I'd go to do and there was change

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.749 
and I'd go to do and there was change
and<00:05:27.690> they<00:05:27.840> would<00:05:27.990> go<00:05:28.409> ballistic<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:29.610> they

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
and they would go ballistic that they

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.070 
and they would go ballistic that they
had<00:05:29.880> changed<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.330> without<00:05:30.479> me<00:05:30.719> knowing

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
had changed it without me knowing

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.740 
had changed it without me knowing
and<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.639> it<00:05:33.090> kind<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.360> started<00:05:33.719> the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
and so that it kind of started the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.330 
and so that it kind of started the
beginning<00:05:33.930> in<00:05:34.259> the<00:05:34.380> comet<00:05:34.710> there<00:05:34.860> is<00:05:34.979> constant

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
beginning in the comet there is constant

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.260
