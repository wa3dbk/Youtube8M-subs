bolt<00:01:25.460> over<00:01:25.580> here<00:01:25.970> that's<00:01:26.510> what<00:01:26.719> holds<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
bolt over here that's what holds the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.859 
bolt over here that's what holds the
starter<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:29.030> one<00:01:29.180> here<00:01:29.359> is<00:01:29.450> easy<00:01:29.630> that's

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
starter on this one here is easy that's

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.060 
starter on this one here is easy that's
where<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.200> need<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.500> sock<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:30.770> in<00:01:31.009> the

where you need to sock it in the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310 
where you need to sock it in the
extension<00:01:31.549> but<00:01:32.329> over<00:01:32.570> here<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.200> use

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
extension but over here you have to use

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.859 
extension but over here you have to use
a<00:01:33.350> wrench<00:01:33.649> all<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.009> way<00:01:34.130> because<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.869> starter

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
a wrench all the way because the starter

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.359 
a wrench all the way because the starter
drive<00:01:36.109> mechanism<00:01:36.649> gets<00:01:36.799> in<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.039> way<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:37.280> you

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
drive mechanism gets in the way and you

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.310 
drive mechanism gets in the way and you
can't<00:01:37.579> use<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:38.500> socket<00:01:40.420> now<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.600> some<00:01:41.929> engines

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
can't use a socket now on some engines

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.310 
can't use a socket now on some engines
the<00:01:42.950> bolts<00:01:43.340> are<00:01:43.490> torques<00:01:43.909> drive<00:01:44.179> so<00:01:45.109> you<00:01:45.200> can

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the bolts are torques drive so you can

00:01:45.320 --> 00:02:09.300 
the bolts are torques drive so you can
use<00:01:45.469> a<00:01:45.500> Torx<00:01:45.890> bit<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.340> want

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.410 

and<00:02:10.310> you're<00:02:10.490> probably<00:02:10.610> thinking<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.150> can<00:02:11.300> use

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and you're probably thinking you can use

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.760 
and you're probably thinking you can use
a<00:02:11.450> ratchet<00:02:11.900> wrench<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:12.260> here

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
a ratchet wrench over here

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.800 
a ratchet wrench over here
it<00:02:13.280> won't<00:02:13.490> spit<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.000> got<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.209> do<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.540> just

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
it won't spit you got to do it like just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.850 
it won't spit you got to do it like just
by<00:02:14.990> hand<00:02:16.959> it's<00:02:17.959> usually<00:02:18.110> best<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.560> hold<00:02:18.680> your

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
by hand it's usually best to hold your

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.699 
by hand it's usually best to hold your
starter<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:19.370> loosen<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:21.560> don't

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
starter here loosen it up so it don't

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.580 
starter here loosen it up so it don't
drop<00:02:24.250> take<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> bolt<00:02:25.580> all<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.790> way<00:02:25.970> out<00:02:26.590> there

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
drop take the bolt all the way out there

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.740 
drop take the bolt all the way out there
it<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:31.640> there<00:02:31.819> are<00:02:31.880> various<00:02:32.180> types<00:02:32.569> of
