little gizmos here protect the pipe from

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.349 
little gizmos here protect the pipe from
the<00:00:03.300> wire<00:00:03.510> from<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.959> braiding<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.560> chafing<00:00:04.859> so

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
the wire from a braiding and chafing so

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.700 
the wire from a braiding and chafing so
got<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.390> whole<00:00:06.540> bunch<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.870> I'm<00:00:07.290> gonna<00:00:07.440> let<00:00:07.620> them

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
got a whole bunch of I'm gonna let them

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.459 
got a whole bunch of I'm gonna let them
down<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:07.980> you're<00:00:08.429> supposed<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.700> use<00:00:09.469> bare

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
down now you're supposed to use bare

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
down now you're supposed to use bare
wire<00:00:10.769> that's<00:00:11.070> not<00:00:11.280> got<00:00:11.550> insulation<00:00:12.150> around<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
wire that's not got insulation around it

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.230 
wire that's not got insulation around it
but<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> what<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> had<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.240> eight

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
but this is what I had so it's eight

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.859 
but this is what I had so it's eight
gauge<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:16.070> it's<00:00:17.070> more<00:00:17.430> than<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> ten<00:00:18.539> for

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
gauge I think it's more than a ten for

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.620 
gauge I think it's more than a ten for
when<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> twelve<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:20.939> anyways<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> what

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
when you twelve but anyways this is what

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.660 
when you twelve but anyways this is what
I<00:00:21.779> had<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:23.720> run<00:00:24.720> these<00:00:24.900> down

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
I had so we use it up run these down

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
I had so we use it up run these down
that<00:00:26.670> ends<00:00:27.230> will<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.380> how<00:00:28.500> deep<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> weld<00:00:29.070> are

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
that ends will do how deep the weld are

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.769 
that ends will do how deep the weld are
in<00:00:29.490> other<00:00:29.609> parts<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> country<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.660> out

chicken to drop it down I guess it's got
to<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.770> done<00:02:37.830> eventually<00:02:38.250> now<00:02:38.580> how<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.850> hold

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to get done eventually now how do I hold

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.330 
to get done eventually now how do I hold
it<00:02:39.300> up<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:41.690> clamp<00:02:45.620> maybe<00:02:46.620> I'll<00:02:46.800> run<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.130> wire

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it up to clamp maybe I'll run the wire

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.360 
it up to clamp maybe I'll run the wire
and<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.820> cut<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.180> wire<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:49.740> wire<00:02:49.920> comes<00:02:50.250> out

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
and I cut this wire the wire comes out

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.860 
and I cut this wire the wire comes out
of<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.520> ground<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.300> time<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.540> cut

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
of the ground I think it's time to cut

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.100 
of the ground I think it's time to cut
it<00:02:52.730> I'll<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.910> some<00:02:54.150> wire<00:02:54.360> nuts<00:02:54.660> underneath

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
it I'll have some wire nuts underneath

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.690 
it I'll have some wire nuts underneath
the<00:02:55.940> cap<00:02:56.940> well<00:02:57.780> cap<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:59.190> I'll<00:02:59.310> run<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> down

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
the cap well cap and I'll run it down

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.610 
the cap well cap and I'll run it down
beside<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.270> plastic<00:03:00.750> pipe<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.290> I'll<00:03:01.410> cut

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
beside this plastic pipe and I'll cut

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.990 
beside this plastic pipe and I'll cut
the<00:03:01.740> plastic<00:03:01.920> pipe<00:03:02.310> from<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.550> wire<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:02.970> the
