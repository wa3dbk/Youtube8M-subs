00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.010
 let's make a crab salad 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.220
 of river with papaya pasta and a vinaigrette 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.439
 of citrus fruits and ginger let's start 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.360
 cleaning the papaya we take a papaya 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.170
 that is well mature we cut it to the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 half 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.360
 what we are going to do is clean it 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 the nuggets we remove them here 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.180
 we are going to hit it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.399
 we need all the skin well because if 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.399
 not bitter 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.010
 and we take it off 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.260
 head 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 and the back once we have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.750
 the papaya already peeled let's cut the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.670
 center 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.059
 and we are going to cut it in the measurements 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.059
 little 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.720
 It is important that the papaya is ripe 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.860
 but do not be too soft because if 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.659
 it is not impossible that we were 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.250
 cutting the can not be too 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.220
 green because if it would not be too much 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.960
 astringent and would not be good once 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.460
 we have the papaya cut we're going to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 move on to our smell 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 we take a leek and we will use the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 whiter part the green part we're going 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 to leave for when we do some kind 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.430
 of broth that has more flavor but is a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.390
 bit harder we are going to cut in julienne 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.390
 very finite 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 something like that in this case we're going to cut 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.090
 the tomato in squares and we're going to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.110
 leave with the skin that in this case to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.110
 our salty will not hinder us 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 Crabs are going to cook and 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.330
 we are going to use only the part of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.220
 the tail the part of the head the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.780
 we will leave to make some broth or some 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.399
 sofrito we can even use it for 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.850
 make a rice let's cook like 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.140
 much a minute if we wanted to cook 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.400
 the head we had to leave it at least 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.930
 three minutes but in this case we're going to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 only count one minute because 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 we're just going to cook to use 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.239
 the skin 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.840
 we put the crabs and leave them 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.660
 as much 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
 an important minute that the water is 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.500
 well salted because if not the crab we 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.110
 would be too lonely and would not have 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.870
 flavor and it's not the same as taking the flavor 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.440
 and the salt since it is cooked to that the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.440
 fuck later 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.410
 then we draw water with ice that we are going to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.660
 make the vinaigrette we have the juice of 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.740
 lime 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.740
 olive oil 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.040
 we're going to take grated ginger 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.950
 grated garlic 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.950
 and lemon zest 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.069
 we mix it this type of vinegar dastan 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.800
 citrus fruits gain in texture if we leave it 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.650
 that is half cut we're going to 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.660
 cook the pasta in this case we are going to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.330
 let cook as much as five minutes 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.550
 because it's about fresh pasta we have 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.830
 our crabs to peel it is so 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 simple as breaking it a little bit 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.980
 down and once it's broken by 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.470
 down 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.840
 open up is the best way to 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.840
 that we do not break the flesh of 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.840
 crab 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.970
 we do not have the cooked pasta we can in 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.440
 a bowl and let's put the crabs already 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.270
 peeled that we keep in the oil 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.270
 olive tomato 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.180
 good 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.819
 we're not going to line up with the vinaigrette 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.820
 let's put the pasta making sure 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.190
 that all the ingredients fall well 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.080
 have a little tomato that has 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.269
 good crab 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.139
 and we are going to finish it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.139
 with papaya 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.400
 we drop the papaya 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.270
 roughly we put a little salt and 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.490
 a little bit of pool 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.710
 and we go back to take a little bit of the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.710
 line that we have here and the crabs 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.170
 and this is the papaya salad 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.220
 crayfish and pasta with vinaigrette 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.220
 of citrus and ginger
