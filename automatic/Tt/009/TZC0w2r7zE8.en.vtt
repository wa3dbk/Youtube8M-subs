00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.350
 aloha we are asked again and again 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.060
 which pencils are used and that is 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.740
 a very important question 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.300
 and in this video we will be you 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.190
 show which pencils for 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.520
 Portrait drawings particularly suitable 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.650
 are and how the hardness or 1 degree 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.850
 revealed that is certainly aware 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.520
 that there are many different ones 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.830
 pencil harsh there and probably 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.230
 also the hair for rather hard and b for 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.059
 rather soft meat is good 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 Material is for a nice drawing 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.680
 very important and that's why we show you 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.449
 here on the basis of a small drawings 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.110
 The german soccer national team 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.519
 with which pencils we work for 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.589
 beautiful shading with many 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.019
 Contrast you work best with 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.699
 several pencils the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.250
 we have different herten show 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.180
 here the effect of 12 pencils 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.040
 with the hardness of 2 to 8 b 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 I draw every third person with one 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 new pencil hardness there are of course 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.920
 the more strength overall 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.049
 range from 9 to 9 b use one 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.290
 hair pencil for the basis of the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.090
 drawing the first sketch as one 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.040
 beautiful drawing must be worked out 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.590
 you increase in this work process 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 the contrast and works with one 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.780
 darker , softer ones made progress 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.450
 That's why we draw everyone here 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.299
 player with a pencil of hardness 2h 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.560
 before the soft so the dark donors 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.109
 user in the drawings the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.570
 basically very shady I am 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.359
 personally prefer to use h 2b and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.100
 4b and can you only recommend the 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.350
 team we draw here is from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.030
 So do not be surprised if 2010 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.030
 some players are not there 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.130
 she starts with serdar tasci and thomas 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.920
 müller and with the same 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.020
 mentioned 2h pencil rest 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 Usually pencils are used with this 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.670
 Strength or harder only for the basis 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.010
 technical drawings or for 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.840
 Graphical representation is used there 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.100
 a hard pencil wiping paper 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.100
 not quite as fast retrieves 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.700
 and it continues with gomez the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.799
 lately in the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.900
 national team not so often to 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.909
 He came and stood outside 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.930
 Holger badstuber are with the strength 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.930
 hair drawn 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.610
 for per mertesacker the German 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.160
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, just left clubs and 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.220
 Simon Rolfes will be f and for the next 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.250
 both want these two gentlemen 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.290
 are almost the same and fig is probably 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.900
 most common pencil and probably 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.190
 Every one of you has your home or home 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.190
 high dearest draws 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.880
 selective and all friedrich of the number 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
 the football has left behind 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.320
 get the pencil as it stands for 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.300
 black means that the pencils 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.150
 now getting softer and that 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.430
 As a result, the result is always darker 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.769
 You can confirm the first ones very well 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.879
 for freehand drawing or smaller 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.590
 use sketches 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.599
 and that's exactly what we're doing here now 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.280
 the extremely popular footballers 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.280
 Schweinsteiger Klose and Podolski 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.520
 the extremely successful coaching duo 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.669
 Joachim Löw is with a pencil of 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.560
 hardness 4b drawn starting from now 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.560
 the really soft donors 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.840
 at the bottom left, the series begins with 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.250
 Trochowski and Marko Marin both in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.509
 the national team stab over him 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.770
 it is also a mystery 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.360
 especially the maria through his 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.979
 fast sprints real one 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.720
 enrichment for the game has been 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.460
 because one wonders with many 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.699
 gifted players are no longer there 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.699
 are 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.619
 The captain for the plan is here with 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:08.619
 the 6b pencil shown 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.709
 So now we go to the goalkeeper trio 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.449
 with manuel new in the middle of he 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.409
 still very successful the German 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.439
 defended 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.149
 with it the 7b pencil starts this 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.919
 you can cure for excellent 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:35.360
 rougher sketches and quick designs 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.249
 do not necessarily use them 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.989
 to be worked out and in one 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.819
 really mature drawing 

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:42.709
 lend these deep black donors 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.989
 in my opinion, a drawing only 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:47.269
 the expression to be really alive 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:49.729
 the last three players work in 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:52.159
 have this picture including mesut özil 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.360
 me with 8 b so the furthest pen in 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.360
 our series draws 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.890
 so now if you have the whole picture 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.240
 Do you look at the differences 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.550
 who hounded by the different ones 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.410
 a dark drawing is generated 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.410
 also creates a different effect 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.420
 as a bright delicate drawing and around it 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.490
 I advise you several more 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.240
 pencils with different herten 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.640
 zuzulegen 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.470
 on our material page we have you 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.000
 the pencils listed again and 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.530
 immediately with amazon on the left 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.450
 besides, we're writing now, of course 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.050
 under each video which founder we 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.360
 use 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.830
 with further questions and wishes could 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.740
 Now, of course, always happy
