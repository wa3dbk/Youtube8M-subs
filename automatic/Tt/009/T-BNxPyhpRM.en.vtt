00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
really do place it in the center like

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
really do place it in the center like
last<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.890> whatever<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.250> want

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
last time and you do whatever you want

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.209 
last time and you do whatever you want
to<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.910> shuffle<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> cut<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to it you can shuffle you can cut you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.130 
to it you can shuffle you can cut you
can<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> bit<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> shuffle<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
can do a bit of a shuffle like this you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
can do a bit of a shuffle like this you
can<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> idea<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> makes<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
can and the idea is that it makes it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
can and the idea is that it makes it
look<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> top<00:00:49.710> at

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
all though it's just the three of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.069 
all though it's just the three of

middle<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> eight<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> heart<00:01:22.530> goes<00:01:22.830> there

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
middle of the eight of heart goes there

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
middle of the eight of heart goes there
sandwiched<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> between<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.900> then

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
sandwiched in between here and then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
sandwiched in between here and then
sandwich<00:01:25.860> even<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.820> slowly<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
sandwich even in here going slowly in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.969 
sandwich even in here going slowly in
the<00:01:27.750> middle<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.380> nothing<00:01:28.799> going

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the middle I see there's nothing going

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
the middle I see there's nothing going
on<00:01:29.189> wrong<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.270> even

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
on wrong here and you see it's not even

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
on wrong here and you see it's not even
on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> top<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.310> happens

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
on the top but look when this happens

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.770 
on the top but look when this happens
when<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.090> doesn't<00:01:33.299> come<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> top<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
when that one doesn't come to top you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.359 
when that one doesn't come to top you
can<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:33.930> rub<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> actually<00:01:35.100> then

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
can just rub like that and actually then

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.580 
can just rub like that and actually then
it<00:01:35.490> comes<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> top<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> course

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it comes to the top and then of course

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230 
it comes to the top and then of course
it<00:01:37.710> goes<00:01:37.799> back<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> walk<00:01:38.280> working<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> normal

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it goes back to walk working to normal

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
it goes back to walk working to normal
you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> eight<00:01:39.900> put<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can take the eight put it in the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520 
you can take the eight put it in the
center<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:42.259> yeah<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> comes

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
center and if you just yeah it comes

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
center and if you just yeah it comes
back<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> top<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.790> how<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.570> we'll

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
back to the top but how about this we'll

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.389 
back to the top but how about this we'll
mix<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.320> we'll<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mix it up a bit we'll take that and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
mix it up a bit we'll take that and
we'll<00:01:47.460> place<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.729> facedown<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> center<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
we'll place it facedown in the center so

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.609 
we'll place it facedown in the center so
now<00:01:50.119> now<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> look<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.470> not

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
now now if you look if you can it's not

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.539 
now now if you look if you can it's not
going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> the

going to it's not going to come to the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.789 
going to it's not going to come to the
top<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.790> sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> randomly<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
top just sort of randomly because you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
able to see it to come to the top this

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.190 
able to see it to come to the top this
time<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.760> take<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.569> place<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.989> into

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
time but we take the a we place it into

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930 
time but we take the a we place it into
the<00:02:34.440> center<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.220> look<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.549> shake

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
the center and now look if you shake

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
the center and now look if you shake
like<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.440> then<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> comes<00:02:37.769> right<00:02:37.890> back<00:02:38.130> to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
like this then it comes right back to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.920 
like this then it comes right back to
the<00:02:38.340> top<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.230> trick
