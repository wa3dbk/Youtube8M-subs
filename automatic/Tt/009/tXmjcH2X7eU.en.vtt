00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello my name is alexey and in this 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.860
 lesson in the program sony vegas pro 13 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.320
 I want to show how to edit video 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.300
 projects are digital juce 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 yes not only in these projects any 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 others that you download from 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.060
 Internet, I will show two options as 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.400
 add edit and delete video 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.620
 from the project in this case in this lesson 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.570
 I'll show the first row and in the second lesson 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.699
 I will show the second option as they 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 take some time and I would not want 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.769
 that these two ways were in one video 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 lessons so oh well on this phenomenon we have 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.949
 there is a project 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.749
 let's open push the letter and and so 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.109
 and the very first thing we need to see 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:51.890
 what it is in our project that's just 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.710
 you will see written on the preview / zone 01 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's see the project itself down there 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.089
 just in those files which are called 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 friend zone with the same name friend zone 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:08.759
 01 in this case in this project only 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 2 / zone is our place with 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.619
 transparency which is just encapsulated 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.540
 in this project so that these pipe zones can 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.280
 was replaced by video or 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.369
 photos like if 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.219
 data / zones will be very much visible 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.930
 name for example here is friend zone 01 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.570
 there are / zones 02 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.579
 or drop for 03 and so on then 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.439
 timeline just click right click 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.920
 choose from the list of media files 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 project click and just in the file menu 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 the project 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.049
 this fraction zone it immediately 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 stands out so well let's say so 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.729
 standard procedure go add 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.189
 video and then on I'll show you how 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.799
 edit video project itself 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.360
 go to the media files of the project right 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.660
 click on this friend zone 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.940
 and find the words replace find our 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.460
 cocaine video on add click on 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.350
 open it then it automatically 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 displayed on the video track so 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.230
 let's immediately find a transition in this 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:14.600
 case in this project is still a little bit 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.220
 let's say from here to this transition 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.330
 This place does not look for a marker 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.530
 on the keyboard, press the emma button here 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.570
 you can write something 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.060
 and we don't write anything like a marker 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.380
 already numbered now given video 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.150
 we will edit 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.160
 let's see here we have happened 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.040
 turn that is the scene itself which is needed 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.570
 in this project she is with us 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.360
 while you see him how much is empty 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.050
 space is not necessary we have already passed here 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.570
 and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.120
 This space needs to be taken exactly 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.090
 This is the scene that is starting now. 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.090
 prior to the beginning of this segment of the video select 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.380
 right click to select a loop as 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 only she stands out in the right 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.060
 the bottom corner is written 25 seconds 23 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.300
 milliseconds 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.840
 remember this tsiferku after this 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.510
 this video on the timeline we will delete that is 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.610
 holding by the edge 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.560
 we safely remove even explain why 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.150
 we will not edit it in this 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 place since we in fact Otroshko 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.290
 is in combination mode 3d 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.659
 I think it is not entirely correct if 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.670
 we'll go back side and make a little 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.930
 another way this video is deleted 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.159
 press presses so tsiferku remembered 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.420
 which has just been twenty-five 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:46.390
 seconds 23 hundredths of a millisecond we go in 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.459
 project media files for this video 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.269
 click right mouse click and click 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.269
 open in 3 world 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.459
 so here we will only find 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.989
 the place where our given begins 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.720
 project 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:13.400
 here from this place we remember time 25 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.920
 seconds 23 hundredths of a millisecond so the cursor 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:27.020
 we are already exposed here in this drop box 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:28.180
 condo wife and prescribe 25 here 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.860
 registered 23 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.500
 then press enter 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.270
 this video section we have stood out 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.069
 before making further 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.560
 action cursor on this phenomenon by setting 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.629
 to this position exactly after the marker 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.479
 this is going to the trimmer by clicking on the video 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:51.110
 about the mouse button and select the highlight 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.090
 only the video after that is highlighted 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.780
 track track itself which is 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.879
 added video and click on this 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.159
 tool from us video added 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.930
 select another track 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.819
 click here and do the same 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.819
 click on this tool 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:25.000
 so now let's see just here 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:27.550
 all this happened and 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.950
 He just want to show this lesson 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.320
 some nuances when will 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.530
 interaction trimmer with mouse now i'm 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.770
 Click for example the frames a second here 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.260
 will not pay attention to this 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.460
 as in any case 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.810
 properties of the project frame rate is also 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.910
 remains 29 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.010
 but at least with me you will 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.780
 set a frame rate of some sort 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.460
 its just 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.770
 agree that the mouse is in 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.530
 interaction with the trimmer so even when 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.510
 will add video by clicking on 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.400
 this timeline, right-click 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.400
 the default mouse 1 is worth using 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.290
 project frame rate if you choose 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.350
 use the frame rate of the media file 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.960
 then accordingly after me 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.400
 the file will be added to the video track 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.790
 do not forget to look at the very end 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.389
 video clip let's do this example 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.190
 a year ago 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.139
 choose a place to use the frequency 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.560
 project frames choose to use 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.990
 the frame rate of the media file so after 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.330
 this cursor is set by marker 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:34.580
 track itself highlighted click 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:40.190
 tool let's see immediately what 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.660
 what happened here is what I said well 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.780
 proper 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.780
 take over the edge 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.569
 so allocate another track 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:58.520
 we click here again press 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.520
 the sting which add our videos and 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.699
 grabbing the edge of the video drag 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.050
 actually the first version of this 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.629
 editing the second option and and show 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.909
 in the second lesson, what if someone has 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.449
