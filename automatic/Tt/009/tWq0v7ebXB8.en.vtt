00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.730
 good morning friends and rubÃ©n and 17 and what 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.230
 today is bring is a gameplay background 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.820
 ok but this is not the important thing we 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.589
 you need to notice the gameplay 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
 what I bring to you is the information 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.669
 about the new trailer that has come out 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.920
 world premiere of the new trailer of 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.630
 call of duty black ops 3 ok I've already 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 seen it seen a lot of people actually 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.170
 it has become trend and everything and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 I had a lot of desire already immediately after 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.390
 upload this video saying everything that has 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 left in the trailer is worth so as 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.180
 I really say the background gameplay is not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.740
 you need to notice if you do not want 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.339
 but because the game I think 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 I finished 3312 if I did not take care of myself and good 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.519
 true that they have not probable is that I go 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.289
 teaching some scenes worth or follow 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.550
 putting pieces of the trailer so that 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.140
 see what I mean and such if not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 you have seen it yet anyway 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 You will have a link to the trailer below in the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.429
 description so you can see what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 it is also in Spanish and 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.809
 immediately upon leaving in English 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.579
 it also came out in Spanish and really 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.780
 let's see this trailer several teaches 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 new scenes so you can see how 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.559
 I'll give you my opinion a bit and all 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.800
 the little things that have come out in this 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.230
 trailer according the truth that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.510
 There is a lot of information that you can give 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.790
 very important the truth so good 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.770
 let's put the first thing to see how 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.750
 is the trailer for you to see these 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.210
 scenes of agreement good the first of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.619
 all obviously tell you where 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.790
 the game goes on where 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.130
 It goes with the game is set 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.040
 in the future it is worth to be exact in the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.810
 year 2065 as it has already been revealed 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.250
 previously it is as you are seeing 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.280
 the soldiers are soldiers 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.619
 futuristic vale there are ships 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.659
 the soldiers let's say they have 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.270
 very advanced warfare style armor 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.220
 is worth one of the things that has been seen in 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.259
 the trailer as you can see is that the 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.970
 players can swim through the water and 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.399
 kill in the water is worth that we will be able to 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.039
 go through the water and kill let's say 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.119
 move while we are in this water and 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.369
 to kill here is as good as it could have been in 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.899
 other games is worth something very very 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.780
 important that has been seen in the trailer 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.090
 it's also the theme of robots guys 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.310
 to see this what does it mean that we are going to 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.990
 face against specters like the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.600
 that there was for example in titan fold 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.480
 it's not worth it, not because you can 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.920
 see in these scenes really 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.660
 it's not that we're faced with 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 spectrum but you can choose between 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.250
 humans or spectra is worth at least the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.290
 election that seems to be there in the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.650
 game is worth as you see then let's say 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.120
 there are soldiers who come out with fists 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.130
 it gives the impression that we are going to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.300
 be able to choose between humans and robots worth 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.040
 at least it is the impression it gives since 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.630
 we are in the future forget that they are 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.910
 humans that have become robots 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.010
 which can also be because we say that 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.170
 the future great part of the story 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.720
 it happens that we say that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.140
 human then 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.810
 as it is said that they have been using the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.160
 mechanics to evolve to go 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.570
 become better in agreement 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.370
 then also more things, for example 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.990
 there's going to be the theme of the jumps as 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.520
 you have been able to appreciate in this scene of 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.080
 here it's worth as you see the jumps let's say 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.120
 what is it said that they will be like 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 double jumps then for the moment 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.580
 let's say you have not appreciated those for 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.020
 so to say it is worth but also worth 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.910
 that also has a kind of mini 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.910
 exos but let's say it's like giving them 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.010
 a simple extra boost is worth it but for 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.709
 so to say but a principle I do not think 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 that is going to be jumps as such of the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.130
 same way it's worth something else like 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.080
 see also is there arc worth we have 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.590
 could see that there is an arch in this 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.700
 trailer so this obviously so 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.500
 can be very cool honestly 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.030
 we have also seen some other 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.060
 losing streak as it can be for 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.290
 example the ball that we have seen in this 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.820
 scene here we have seen that there is a ball 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.209
 who rolls killing a guy then this 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.440
 Well, I do not know, it's funny, not the game 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.390
 We definitely know also that 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.760
 will leave on 6 of 11 also wanted 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.590
 say it I will leave October 6 as usual 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.870
 be usual for these dates 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.769
 important has also shown a 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.920
 this scene of zombies but really 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.200
 cortita 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.610
 this is the scene that you have it and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.599
 it really is quite short the truth 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.239
 also the most important thing perhaps of all 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.150
 worth is the most important thing of all is that 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.450
 It is already absolutely official voucher call 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.390
 duty white 3 will not go out for the old 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.330
 generation is worth I already know playstation 3 or 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.590
 xbox 360 has not come out absolutely for 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
 that is, it will not go absolutely to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.099
 no side is going to continue so much for 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.500
 pc as for xbox one as for 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.019
 playstation 4 is worth that is official since 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.459
 in the trailer he says he has done here 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.310
 I'm going to show you the scene that puts 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.510
 lion's bullet in this silver the variable 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.260
 I do not forgive, I have it in Spanish 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.060
 available in equipment one ps4 ipc voucher i 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.180
 I think the most important thing of all 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.530
 On the one hand, we're going to have 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.840
 reserve it an option to get the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.920
 beta is worth going to a beta that is being 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.240
 talking about it going out one or two months 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.330
 before the game it's obviously not worth the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.740
 they're going to take out one thing from the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.970
 that is talking a lot and very 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.670
 important perhaps is the issue of how it 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.010
 says exclusivity is worth the subject of 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.540
 the exclusivity has not been seen 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.910
 absolutely by nowhere 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.550
 no indication that there will be 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.070
 exclusivity on the part of xbox one worth 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.690
 that is by any place normally 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.420
 They often give us to understand that what is 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.460
 xbox the recorded gameplay usually put 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.380
 it's recorded with xbox voucher it's usually 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.960
 put and this time they have not given us any 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.760
 indication of this so it tends to 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.290
 think that it may be that it has 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.690
 determined the exclusivity that xbox one 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.450
 or even it has come to talk about that 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.240
 has happened to fight to ps 4 is worth 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.820
 this would be even even great for 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.930
 those who are from ps 4 like me for example 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.120
 since it has been so long 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.950
 exclusive for xbox, because it would play 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.390
 turn it into playstation 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.190
 bar regardless of how many can 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.280
 get angry but for those of play 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.750
 we see it backwards as I say about everything 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.140
 affects the theme of the old generation 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.000
 ok if you have ps3 or xbox 360 they are not 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.040
 to take out or is it completely to the not what 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.480
 they are going to remove these consoles except that 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.940
 there is some change and they say they take it out 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.520
 because in my opinion, sincerely , 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.370
 they are loading a large part of the market 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.800
 but hey guys this is like that over 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.180
 of the analysis worth of this trailer is worth 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.670
 I already know that the 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.490
 true but good really is that way a 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.100
 little above to show you x scenes 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.270
 of the trailer and later if more 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.000
 information 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.070
 I imagine that I will bring it to you, it is worth everything 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.570
 if more scenes come out or whatever it is about 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.760
 the whole subject of zombies that you already know 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.840
 that now I'm going to start uploading zombies 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.310
 especially with this if it comes out more 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.840
 information near this most likely 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.220
 is that I bring it because that's what 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.390
 I'm really more interested in you 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.310
 you are the zombies more than the 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.530
 multiplayer and finally I also 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.230
 I would like to add that it has also been 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.970
 revealed the official cover of the game 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.520
 ok here I will show you what is the 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.620
 of pc but really it has also 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.750
 shown the ps3 and that of ps or that of 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
 pc 4 loss of xbox one that are going to be 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.870
 really the same but good is pointed 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.310
 and the others are the same but of their 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.740
 respective consoles worth this is the 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.110
 official cover as it is more or less 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.120
 I sensed that it was going to be the image and also 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.830
 the image of call of duty black ops 3 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.409
 zombies what is this here is worth something 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.750
 more simple but this is the official 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:06.740
 what is going to be so these have been 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.879
 the covers and well, I hope that 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.379
 I really liked this video guys 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.090
 that you leave a great like if it has been
