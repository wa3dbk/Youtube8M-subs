00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.490 
and an easy key to play as well and the
second<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.330> tower<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.990> survival

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
second way will be a tower for survival

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.640 
second way will be a tower for survival
on<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.740> rotation<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.370> well<00:01:42.350> tower<00:01:43.350> for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
on the rotation a as well tower for

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.170 
on the rotation a as well tower for
survivals<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.790> hard<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.120> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
survivals a little bit hard to get a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.850 
survivals a little bit hard to get a
hold<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.480> actually<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.380> harder<00:01:46.650> to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
hold of actually quite a bit harder to

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.419 
hold of actually quite a bit harder to
get<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> hold<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
get a hold of

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.520 
get a hold of
so<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.420> guess<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.689> can<00:01:49.780> always<00:01:49.899> go<00:01:50.079> and<00:01:50.409> ask

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
so I guess you can always go and ask

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.020 
so I guess you can always go and ask
your<00:01:50.770> friends<00:01:51.100> if<00:01:51.130> they<00:01:51.189> have<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.429> keys<00:01:51.670> or

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
