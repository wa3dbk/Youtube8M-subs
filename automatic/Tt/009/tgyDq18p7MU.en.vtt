00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
we're going to be doing the oval wave

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
we're going to be doing the oval wave
which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> instruction<00:01:50.700> booklet<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
which is in the instruction booklet that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
which is in the instruction booklet that
you<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.159> you're<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.340> want<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> do

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
is start wrapping at the top here and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.999 
is start wrapping at the top here and
just<00:01:57.060> loosely<00:01:57.659> wrap<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> around<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.710> build

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
just loosely wrap it around and build

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.819 
just loosely wrap it around and build
your<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> top<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.740> gonna

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
your way up to the top you just gonna

your way up to the top you just gonna
hold<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.670> bit<00:02:02.790> until<00:02:03.119> it
