00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 at 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.380
 my name is janet and I run the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.970
 foundation for the protection of 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.040
 wild camels which is a 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.840
 non-governmental organization 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.970
 English whose mission is to protect 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.510
 the wild camel is in danger 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.510
 extinction criticism 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 the wild camel is a species apart 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 whole he has bumps and we have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.019
 has about 600 in China and 450 in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.920
 mongolia which are the only countries where they 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.920
 still live in the wild 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 they are critically endangered 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.920
 mainly because of the activity 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.360
 human 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 one of the problems is the implementation of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 illegal mining in protected areas 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.699
 in China and Mongolia to extract 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.199
 among others, gold and copper 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.970
 camels are also faced with 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.699
 another problem which is the increase 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.150
 of the number of lists in effect in these 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.920
 two countries 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.080
 the shepherds hunt wolves in order to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 protect their flocks what has for 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 consequence of pushing them towards the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
 desert areas where camels live 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 the wolves attack their little ones 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.660
 who a few days after their birth 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660
 are easy prey 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 in china wild camels live 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.570
 in a particular area where were 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 carried out 43 nuclear tests until 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 1970 is the power of each test 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.120
 was superior to that of the bomb 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.780
 atomic dropped on hiroshima and the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.880
 camel survived he also survived 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 with salt water whose salt content in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.350
 this region is superior to that of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.350
 sea ​​water imagine what animal 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.490
 in Mongolia the situation 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.590
 was more favorable since it was not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.120
 not a nuclear test area that there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 had fresh water and there are some 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.479
 by the way still 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.950
 despite this the camel is still 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.379
 threatened by mining activities 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 illegal and as I say 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.640
 previously 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.290
 my mission through the foundation is 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.160
 to try to protect this creature 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.980
 amazing 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 which genetically differs from 35% of the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 domestic camel at blue bosses 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.600
 also called the camel of your sort 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.340
 yann in 2008 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.280
 samples were sent to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 the veterinary university come after 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.700
 five years of dna tests 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.410
 it has been officially declared that he 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 it was a species in its own right 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.830
 in the family of camelids that 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.410
 differs from other known species 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.330
 for five hundred thousand years it was a 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.950
 very good news justifying a little 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.360
 the more the need to preserve this 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 stopover in 2004 we built a 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.010
 breeding center in Mongolia in 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.570
 the gobi desert were brought 8 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.250
 wild camel during the period of 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.280
 reproduction 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.320
 we have 22 in 2014 his camels 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.850
 stays in this pad a few months so 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.800
 to be isolated from domestic camels 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.040
 then are released in their 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.040
 environment 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.760
 I invite anyone who has seen 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.530
 this video to share and stay 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.900
 attentive to the situation of this species 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.580
 threatened 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.640
 he is an extraordinary creature 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.480
 that few people know he has 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.950
 survived in China and Mongolia 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.510
 if you can support others 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.950
 foundations which is the only one in the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.080
 world whose actions are dedicated 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:51.620
 only to the preservation of the camel 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.620
 wild www.websense.com thanks
