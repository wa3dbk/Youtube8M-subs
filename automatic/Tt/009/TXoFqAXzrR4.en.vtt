00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.180
 this one wanted for the big one but they were not 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.889
 although not in stream and the one that goes to 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.809
 take now it's narcissus mine 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.080
 Narcissus that will be the friendly half turn 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.849
 for Galmarini does not Galmarini with 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.849
 the second money poster service 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.380
 this is my life 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 the attitude appeared again 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.070
 opportunity for the band on the right 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 very well he did mine because he endures 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.230
 the ball discharges it and then returns 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.260
 towards the center to try to be who 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.900
 receive that ball the referee had a 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.850
 perfect viewing angle to point 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.850
 to the ball mine the shot 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.170
 and continues with that stigma of the original 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.050
 if they are a fault from as from the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.030
 criminal blotch got a lot of cream to their 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.180
 tacos smoke to the healthy and finished 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 crashing the ball on the post 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 the inertias that remain as well 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.990
 we pointed it out with the owner and that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 intelligence assistance capacity 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 to move from mauro boselli and the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 inability unfortunately for 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 define however that we already know that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.890
 what makes the difference in this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 sport is forcefulness has not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 had and in any action with the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.170
 individual category that has the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 lion set that can do it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 weigh the shag mounts again with the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.860
 spherical opening for elías hernández 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.540
 elías to adequately control is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.490
 spherical and look for the overflow you want 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.490
 remove the ball 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.440
 but not 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.440
 Juli Peña does not forgive the Empire 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.980
 strike perfect appellant the dough lunch 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 and the lion the beast 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.489
 if you are taking advantage and you are winning 1 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.489
 by 0 1 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.830
 is elías hernández with the rating 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.480
 perfect for the aris got up from 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.330
 extraordinary way the diagonal 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.700
 delayed is perfect for this man 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.450
 for the goal and club although it was the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.830
 intervention by goalkeeper eder patiño 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.570
 it's definitely not the best I had 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.750
 option to divert this ball 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.050
 because it passes very close to giving her hand to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.270
 Leon already confirmed that if capacity 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.580
 individual is about the best 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.230
 they handle it's not easy to grab for that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.720
 impressive stretch that has the bully 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.250
 rock in the open field and reality 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.290
 is that salustiano candia this man who 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.120
 we remember it with veracruz of very good 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.400
 step by colon santa faith looks great 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.990
 and it is out of place or does not say 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.610
 umpire who does not have it narcissus mine 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.610
 but it is already open there is a lack 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.010
 marketing 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.260
 antonio rodríguez 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.420
 who teach this criminal to Rafa 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.299
 mark let's see it there in repetition 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.220
 do not hesitate to a single second marked 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.490
 rodríguez 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.680
 there I see a repetition the control of 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.500
 narcissus mine backs the ball there 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.110
 what do you think a balance is worth nothing 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.910
 absolutely nothing and if I want another 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.910
 invention to arbitrate on behalf of frame 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.670
 rodríguez for me the whistle profile 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.270
 stream by stream spherical michael 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.270
 the shot 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:54.100
 knocking down parts and that's impossible 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.410
 for 4 if you want to save you have to 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.690
 put the ones that have opportunities like 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.930
 this one of the criminal core is amazing by the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.030
 4 the moon so there is no team to be saved 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.140
 that clear and less with these 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.240
 opportunities in the two penalties he has 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.460
 wasted wasted the whole 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.100
 of the atlantean from the moment in which 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.650
 outlined a lot of the hobby that 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.420
 it's worth it here in the tribune 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.700
 acute litis that has had for 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.350
 long time already 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.660
 the picture quickly for walter erviti 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.480
 of tracing the ball looking for the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.250
 accompaniment of manuel viniegra 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.570
 opening for candle sailing with the center at 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.570
 area that tries to kill mine 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.530
 in the end 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.580
 do not miss the opportunity that you 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.750
 add within the area 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.840
 sanz the shot to beat william and 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.430
 with a total stroke of luck like that of 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.620
 dressing room 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.650
 the atlante managed to discount in this 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.320
 party there was cancer or this is placed I 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.150
 one by one I would say that if a great goal 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.390
 a great conquest full of 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.670
 virtuosity intelligence of 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.240
 effectiveness beyond the deviation that 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.760
 produces part of the shot of Manuel 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.040
 viniegra appears by surprise in that 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.380
 area where absolutely nobody is 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.840
 close to your position what good does it 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.860
 narcissus mine interpreting what was it 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.860
 that the play was demanding
