00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
fun to do with shoulder mode and point

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.590 
fun to do with shoulder mode and point
mode<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:18.210> instead<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> having<00:00:19.230> both<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:20.600> elbow

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and this is going to be a combination

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.900 
and this is going to be a combination
between<00:00:33.420> point<00:00:34.079> mode<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> shoulder<00:00:34.680> look

which one you toss and which one you

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:06.830 
which one you toss and which one you
keep<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.959> deployment

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.259 

so<00:02:07.840> clue<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.259> have<00:02:08.649> fun<00:02:08.800> with<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.099> if<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.119> can

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
so clue that have fun with it if you can

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.690 
so clue that have fun with it if you can
think<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.539> any<00:02:10.660> other<00:02:10.720> ideas<00:02:11.319> or<00:02:12.010> things<00:02:12.580> that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700
