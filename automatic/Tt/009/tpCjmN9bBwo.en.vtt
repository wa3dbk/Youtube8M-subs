of<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> first<00:02:10.530> summit<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.459> very

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
of the first summit it's very very

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.490 
of the first summit it's very very
special<00:02:11.970> I've<00:02:12.270> got<00:02:12.420> access<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.110> nineteen

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
special I've got access to the nineteen

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.850 
special I've got access to the nineteen
fifty

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
fifty

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
fifty
footage<00:02:14.310> as<00:02:14.460> well<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.390> there<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:15.930> lots<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
footage as well so there can be lots of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
footage as well so there can be lots of
comparisons<00:02:16.800> between<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.310> I'm<00:02:17.460> going

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
comparisons between what I'm going

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.250 
comparisons between what I'm going
through<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.150> Hillary<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> Tenzing

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
through and what Hillary and Tenzing

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.650 
through and what Hillary and Tenzing
went<00:02:19.770> through<00:02:19.920> 60<00:02:20.340> years<00:02:20.550> ago<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.330> reckon

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
went through 60 years ago so you reckon

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.210 
went through 60 years ago so you reckon
you'll<00:02:21.780> be<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.410> summit<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.010> two

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
you'll be at the summit in what two

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.680 
you'll be at the summit in what two
weeks<00:02:24.800> hopefully<00:02:25.800> yeah<00:02:26.220> middle<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.640> mayhem<00:02:27.150> at

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
weeks hopefully yeah middle of mayhem at

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.420 
weeks hopefully yeah middle of mayhem at
the<00:02:27.840> moment<00:02:28.170> we're<00:02:28.260> waiting<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> weather

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the moment we're waiting for the weather

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
the moment we're waiting for the weather
conditions<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.240> improve<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.080> also<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.770> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
conditions to improve and also for the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.230 
conditions to improve and also for the
mountain<00:02:32.310> actually<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.910> prepared

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
mountain actually to get prepared

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.420 
mountain actually to get prepared
believe<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.320> or<00:02:34.380> not<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.830> actual<00:02:34.920> summit

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
believe it or not the actual summit

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.980 
believe it or not the actual summit
routes<00:02:35.610> they<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.060> actually<00:02:36.300> put<00:02:36.570> some<00:02:36.600> ropes

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
routes they do actually put some ropes

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.920 
routes they do actually put some ropes
there<00:02:37.860> cuz<00:02:38.160> some<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> ridges<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.150> 3,000

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
there cuz some of the ridges there 3,000

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
there cuz some of the ridges there 3,000
meter<00:02:40.080> drop<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.920> really<00:02:41.880> am<00:02:41.970> risking<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.450> lot

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
meter drop so I really am risking a lot

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480 
meter drop so I really am risking a lot
to<00:02:42.780> try<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.080> raise<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.380> million<00:02:43.709> pounds<00:02:44.070> but

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
to try and raise this million pounds but

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.160 
to try and raise this million pounds but
also<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.880> try<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.390> invite<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.780> into<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.080> world

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
also to try and invite you into my world

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.740 
also to try and invite you into my world
I<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.120> Everest<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
I like to think of this as a Everest the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.380 
I like to think of this as a Everest the
real<00:02:48.930> deal<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.670> let's<00:02:50.670> just<00:02:50.760> hope<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
real deal and let's just hope that the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.090 
real deal and let's just hope that the
satellite<00:02:52.020> technology<00:02:52.590> works<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:52.980> you're

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
satellite technology works when you're

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.350 
satellite technology works when you're
at<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.250> top<00:02:53.430> because<00:02:53.610> you'll<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:53.970> talking<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
at the top because you'll be talking to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.350 
at the top because you'll be talking to
us<00:02:54.600> hopefully<00:02:55.050> from<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.320> top<00:02:55.500> when<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.360> apps

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
us hopefully from the top when you apps

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.870 
us hopefully from the top when you apps
absolutely<00:02:58.290> i'll<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.160> doing<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.459> series<00:02:59.850> of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
absolutely i'll be doing a series of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.479 
absolutely i'll be doing a series of
lives<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.600> way<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.020> very<00:03:01.200> top<00:03:01.489> if

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
lives all the way up to the very top if

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.770 
lives all the way up to the very top if
you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.790> imagine<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.270> red<00:03:03.480> bull<00:03:03.660> stratos

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you can imagine like a red bull stratos

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.740 
you can imagine like a red bull stratos
type<00:03:04.380> feel<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.430> Everest<00:03:05.820> I've<00:03:06.570> been

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
type feel but on Everest I've been

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.120 
type feel but on Everest I've been
testing<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.350> kit<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.739> two<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.070> half

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
testing all this kit for two and a half

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.890 
testing all this kit for two and a half
years<00:03:08.550> that's<00:03:09.060> how<00:03:09.150> long<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.480> campaign's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
years that's how long the campaign's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
years that's how long the campaign's
been<00:03:10.110> going<00:03:10.320> for<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.739> I'm<00:03:11.010> very<00:03:11.070> very

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
been going for so I'm very very

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.010 
been going for so I'm very very
confident<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.450> technology<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.930> going

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
confident that the technology is going

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.570
