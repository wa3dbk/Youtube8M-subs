00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 we must think of the earth carbonara 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 how bacon is made with eggs 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.720
 or the pillow according to the versions 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 let's say the pillow for the carbonara of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.820
 sea 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.470
 we do the same thing we use 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 parmesan roe fish eggs 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 oil vermicelli and a glass of wine 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 we take fish eggs 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.059
 let's take a slight incision 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 on the bag and turning the knife 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.590
 in fact we extract our eggs 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.079
 if it starts to become a dish that 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 you will often do you will begin to recognize 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 the qualities of the eggs and indeed the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.300
 fish quality 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.730
 for example his dish is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 particularly good with saint's eggs 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.910
 Peter 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 try the roe battagliamo 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 strips like maybe bacon 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 we are to put in the pan with a drop 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.760
 of oil and we have to make it crunchy 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.259
 It does not need to be too long of 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.680
 a panel is thinly cut so there 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.680
 will take little 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:36.540
 crunchy to remove if we put it on 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:39.420
 on a cloth to dry at this point 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.210
 in the pan add a clove 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.280
 of garlic in shirt we did not put 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 first in garlic because otherwise of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 our bottarga would have tasted 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.420
 of agno instead we want to leave it like this 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.710
 naked and raw 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 then we add our eggs 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 this this operation very much 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.770
 important that is precisely that of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 take the eggs and crush them properly 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.640
 they must separate us 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:23.400
 meanwhile lower the pasta e 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.950
 we continue to crush our eggs 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.760
 at this point I remove the garlic and go to 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.760
 add the white wine 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.610
 I turn off 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.280
 I add a dash of cooking water e 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:01.280
 our europe sauce we drain the pasta 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 always nice al dente when we're almost there 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.830
 when cooked let's take a little bit 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.830
 of our crunchy bottarga la 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.370
 let's make even more small we start a 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:22.810
 put it inside so we get to the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:25.400
 fresh ground pepper with the help of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.900
 committed fork we cut it to do 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.900
 our carbonara dish 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.720
 add some pepper parmesan 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.570
 freshly ground and we put our own 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.130
 slices of crispy bottarga la 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.130
 carbonara di mare is ready
