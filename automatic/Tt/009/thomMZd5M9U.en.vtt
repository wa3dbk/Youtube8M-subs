00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.550
 it was back to school for the rcm this weekend first match in 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.400
 moving to the promu boulogne monaco confederal 15 months ago 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.790
 archc-favorite the Massicois know that a match against a promoted can 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.809
 sometimes complicated 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.229
 men jeff dubois can not take long to learn 

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:19.050
 more in this meeting 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.840
 I feel that the Massicois pack is starting to register the first 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640
 try the part 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 The first of a long series 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.630
 clark does not turn my week 51 0% 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670
 the number 10 but also although we find a few moments later 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 with this beautiful combination between jean martineau that adds five points of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.150
 more for mascouche these fossils would do it will not be 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 the previous week 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.840
 blog in lack of efficiency optier loses valuable points by missing 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 their first two penalties 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 r 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.960
 in the 27th minute messi pushed a little more the nail on this breakthrough garza 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.070
 -15 Massicois only has to send to vacallo to who goes away quietly 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.070
 flatten in the middle of the photos 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 mass sport this March 19th 0% to 6 months 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.780
 this follows a new big push of the pack of aol cercoux 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.160
 that fit together register the fourth try of this article 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.320
 by cons the coach but the sitcom already the 24 million wide 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
 the man then leaves the murder and marcel first three 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.760
 the bunnies points of the game on this penalty of 2007 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.820
 just before the break the bolonnais is unable to compete to help me with 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.900
 their opponents concede a penalty try 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.070
 at half-time the same Massicois 31-3 portrait 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.359
 back from the massive locker room hands out a layer the baccalaureate bachelor 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.850
 escapes along the line to inscribe the sixth try of the game 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.669
 at the end of this week 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 clark do not tremble msi even 38 to troyes 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.249
 in the 54th minute following a news gave the job no sm the king who 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.849
 comes flattening captivating even his teammates finau maka the camera 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.059
 Wednesday morning does not hurt if 43 goals 3 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.389
 the Boulonnais who twice have the opportunity to make life less 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 of salt 2010 does not find the poles 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.159
 like all trying to put a little pace in this end of the meeting 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.040
 immaterial kobo of his show this time my daughter will not be 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.579
 passed the last two points of the game 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.599
 final score 55 3 created in 2000 finalist last year they do not have 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.559
 trembled at the problem 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 no jean jacques 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.439
 by age group 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.439
 the day was stolen 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.860
 Lille have had the honor 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.919
 the judgment is in its role 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:17.609
 the next day the world she too beautiful I think it was the name of 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.799
 the economy 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.709
 we had walked 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.629
 because the promoted especially that they usually promoted 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.480
 the Indians imitate them already in federal 2 so I knew he 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.639
 was going to play to a fund for the fight against crime 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.299
 then a little bit of the passion to ride in federal 1 goes up in 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.779
 federal contributions 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.469
 the goal of finalizing 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.659
 editions passed me I think we would have liked to play thoroughly especially 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:39.619
 half-century 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.619
 many were really expecting his 1,82 start the fed in particular 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.039
 yet we are a little bit of the focus before we have followed the compromise 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.319
 melee ascendancy 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.559
 but on balloons worn we took the opportunity to surprise 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.399
 we had a video game with these sites if the season starts there 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:55.959
 always remains difficult 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.379
 I find it a little dilapidated in March and to extend life 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:01.359
 the authors of the report 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.309
 it made the difference 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.799
 while it's tight that 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.369
 not on the quality of the game emissaries on stage 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.459
 he also told 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.359
 this encounter knows the ease of the task at the end of the match but there I 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.789
 am a little tired 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.059
 the fatigue is felt he was still 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:18.959
 these shows the movie 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.290
 I had a scanner the first games of the season and the pace of 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.840
 Contents 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.570
 but never replaced by the physical sciences we could do something else 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.669
 before you know 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.550
 it's right now 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 necessarily very low and pesticides are a little better 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.210
 the little sin of gluttony on his site here 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.210
 everything is a little too fast and too much must be counted 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.479
 we can then discuss 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.509
 3 the score was done they were all his guests by several sponsors did 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.470
 not played a lot of matches 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.999
 since this summer the case in hand 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
 you are a hothouse fan and 5 rebounds 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:53.340
 Rakotoarivelo 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.340
 good here finally greenhouse 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.460
 - March 7, 2011 and round table he unleashed the sequels of boer the bonus 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.759
 but it's still good for me this season in c1 is very good 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.800
 a season that begins in the best of ways massive return of 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.680
 they are all the more reassuring it is the quality of the group solemi and 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.889
 that's what all the major players in the team were not present 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.629
 Sunday to elect my team and players - g 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.449
 I just tried to replay the game and I want to show that I would be 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.680
 already behind 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.040
 I tried gesture 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.270
 but also this year 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.560
 on the go the wounded and the players are expected down and injured 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.889
 and the sick 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.249
 violence and every interview 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:37.409
 the world has found its quality in the heart 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.779
 for her he is often nicknamed 1930 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.779
 The way is still long 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.599
 for his second 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.499
 we often made the difference 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.800
 the last ones for this 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.930
 to get his solution 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.889
 to aim always higher 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.439
 the line of sight for matisse and of course the pro d2 I ran 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.650
 to reach you have to win their confrontation next Sunday at 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.139
 home facing strasbourg
