a little<00:00:09.280> more<00:00:09.370> empty<00:00:09.700> today<00:00:09.820> and<00:00:10.120> expend<00:00:10.420> the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
a little more empty today and expend the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.590 
a little more empty today and expend the
other<00:00:10.660> days<00:00:10.900> but<00:00:11.620> I<00:00:12.160> think<00:00:13.030> things<00:00:13.210> will<00:00:13.360> fill

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
other days but I think things will fill

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.269 
other days but I think things will fill
up<00:00:13.780> as<00:00:14.350> the<00:00:14.530> day<00:00:14.650> goes<00:00:14.800> on

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
up as the day goes on

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.359 
up as the day goes on
if<00:00:16.429> you<00:00:16.580> double<00:00:16.910> it<00:00:17.060> right<00:00:17.840> there<00:00:18.369> he's

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
if you double it right there he's

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.200 
if you double it right there he's
signing<00:00:19.730> autographs<00:00:20.090> and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
signing autographs and

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.280 
signing autographs and
stuff<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:22.960> I<00:00:22.990> think<00:00:24.300> complexity<00:00:25.300> and<00:00:25.540> effects

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
stuff and I think complexity and effects

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.380 
stuff and I think complexity and effects
oh<00:00:26.440> we're<00:00:26.680> playing<00:00:26.800> right<00:00:27.070> now<00:00:27.100> I<00:00:27.550> wonder
