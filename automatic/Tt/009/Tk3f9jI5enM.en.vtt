you guys messaged me and tweeted me

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
you guys messaged me and tweeted me
after<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> needed<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> haul<00:00:19.170> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
after that that I needed to do a haul so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
after that that I needed to do a haul so
that's<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.130> doing

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
that's what I'm doing

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.700 
that's what I'm doing
basically<00:00:21.390> all<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.720> stuff<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
basically all this stuff that I got is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
basically all this stuff that I got is
for<00:00:23.369> fall<00:00:23.789> which<00:00:24.240> makes<00:00:24.539> sense<00:00:24.810> because

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
for fall which makes sense because

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.689 
for fall which makes sense because
that's<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.250> season<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.859> sin<00:00:28.859> No<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that's what season it is a sin No so I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
that's what season it is a sin No so I
guess<00:00:29.880> I'll<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.119> start<00:00:30.269> off<00:00:30.449> where<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> got

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
guess I'll just start off where I got

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.590 
guess I'll just start off where I got
the<00:00:31.170> most<00:00:31.439> things<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.489> gab<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the most things which was gab and the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.970 
the most things which was gab and the
reason<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.290> lot<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:34.770> there

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
reason that I got a lot of stuff there

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.450 
reason that I got a lot of stuff there
is<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.450> they<00:00:36.450> were<00:00:36.510> having<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.920> bunch

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
is because they were having like a bunch

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.500 
is because they were having like a bunch
of<00:00:38.790> fall<00:00:39.210> stuff<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.760> $5<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.000> item

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
of fall stuff that was like $5 in item

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
of fall stuff that was like $5 in item
when<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> found<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.219> on
