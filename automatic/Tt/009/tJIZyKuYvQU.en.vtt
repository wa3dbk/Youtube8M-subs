00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.629 
of getting comfortable with this tool
and<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:26.810> little<00:04:27.229> practice<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.860> you'll<00:04:28.370> get<00:04:28.490> it

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
and a little practice and you'll get it

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.480 
and a little practice and you'll get it
it's<00:04:28.760> really<00:04:28.849> simple<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.419> use<00:04:29.599> it's<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:30.490> just
