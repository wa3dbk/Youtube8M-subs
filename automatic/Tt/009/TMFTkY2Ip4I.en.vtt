00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
did put the batteries in you have to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
did put the batteries in you have to
open<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> set<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.800> hatch<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.369> with

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
open up the set a little hatch here with

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.600 
open up the set a little hatch here with
a<00:00:32.579> screwdriver<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.780> insert<00:00:34.140> six<00:00:34.559> no<00:00:35.460> my

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a screwdriver you insert six no my

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
a screwdriver you insert six no my
batteries<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.899> gun<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.110> full<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.770> all

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
batteries and this gun is full out all

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.979 
batteries and this gun is full out all
by<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.790> no<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> off<00:00:39.719> switch

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
by the way there's no on and off switch

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.130 
by the way there's no on and off switch
so<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.360> worked<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.750> pulling<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
so it's just it worked by pulling a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.299 
so it's just it worked by pulling a
trigger<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.149> actually<00:00:45.600> quite<00:00:45.750> loud

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
trigger now and it's actually quite loud

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.170 
trigger now and it's actually quite loud
it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.840> quite<00:00:49.350> slow<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.030> has

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it is actually quite slow but it has

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.080 
it is actually quite slow but it has
some<00:00:51.360> good<00:00:51.539> range<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> i<00:00:53.370> guess<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> almost

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
some good range so i guess it almost

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.080 
some good range so i guess it almost
makes<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.309> accuracy<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.910> them

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
makes up for it but the accuracy of them

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900 
makes up for it but the accuracy of them
is<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.629> best<00:00:57.930> either<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
is that best either but here we are this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.719 
is that best either but here we are this
is<00:01:00.079> almost<00:01:01.079> exactly<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.760> speed<00:01:03.090> swarm<00:01:03.449> I

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
is almost exactly like the speed swarm I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.679 
is almost exactly like the speed swarm I
the<00:01:05.729> only<00:01:05.760> difference<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the only difference would just be the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.370 
the only difference would just be the
colors<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.900> even<00:01:10.170> know

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
colors really I don't really even know

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.510 
colors really I don't really even know
if<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.680> anything<00:01:10.860> different<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
if there's anything different with a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
if there's anything different with a
texture<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.060> anything<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.510> seems<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
texture or anything it seems like it's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.460 
texture or anything it seems like it's
all<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> same<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> gun<00:01:15.689> does<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
all the same so this gun does have the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.700 
all the same so this gun does have the
little<00:01:17.000> pouch<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.420> type<00:01:18.900> thing<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.380> your

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
little pouch here type thing for your

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.929 
little pouch here type thing for your
darts<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.720> short<00:01:22.200> bandolier<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.220> can

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
darts and a really short bandolier I can

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.789 
darts and a really short bandolier I can
imagine<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.630> wouldn't<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.350> able<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> put<00:01:25.710> this

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
imagine I wouldn't be able to put this

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.429 
imagine I wouldn't be able to put this
around<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.130> shoulder<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.700> hook<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:28.049> with

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
around my shoulder and hook it here with

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.800 
around my shoulder and hook it here with
everything<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.759> imagine<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.479> use

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
everything but I can imagine you can use

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
everything but I can imagine you can use
this<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> pouch<00:01:32.600> combined<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:34.700> well

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
this with the pouch combined with well

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700 
this with the pouch combined with well
maybe<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.540> pouch<00:01:36.720> itself<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.350> something

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
maybe just the pouch itself or something

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.060 
maybe just the pouch itself or something
to<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> seems<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:39.840> very

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
to put on you as it seems to be very

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.840 
to put on you as it seems to be very
sure<00:01:42.020> as<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.579> right

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
sure as you can see here it's like right

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.499 
sure as you can see here it's like right
up<00:01:45.180> against<00:01:45.950> Marvin<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.119> also<00:01:48.270> two

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
up against Marvin so there are also two

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.770 
up against Marvin so there are also two
sling<00:01:49.290> adapters<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
sling adapters on this so if you can you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.410 
sling adapters on this so if you can you
can't<00:01:52.049> attach<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.710> slings<00:01:53.670> right<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.149> here

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can't attach these slings right in here

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410 
can't attach these slings right in here
I<00:01:55.110> guess<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> could<00:01:55.890> leave<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> pouch<00:01:57.180> on

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I guess you could leave the pouch on

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
I guess you could leave the pouch on
here<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:59.189> two<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.460> them

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
here if you want and there's two of them

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.970 
here if you want and there's two of them
on<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> bottom<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> handle<00:02:00.570> one

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
on the bottom to handle one

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.070 
on the bottom to handle one
kids<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.760> can<00:02:01.910> just<00:02:01.940> hang<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.050> your

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
kids so you can just hang it on your

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.260 
kids so you can just hang it on your
shoulder<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.560> guess<00:02:03.830> so<00:02:04.160> this<00:02:04.910> gun<00:02:05.090> doesn't

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
shoulder I guess so this gun doesn't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.150 
shoulder I guess so this gun doesn't
have<00:02:05.480> any<00:02:05.750> railings<00:02:06.230> on<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.560> or<00:02:06.710> any<00:02:06.830> sites

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
have any railings on it or any sites

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.520 
have any railings on it or any sites
because<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.730> from<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:09.170> was<00:02:09.320> originally

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
because it's from the it was originally

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.230 
because it's from the it was originally
from<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> dart<00:02:10.190> tag<00:02:10.369> series<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.940> doesn't

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
from the dart tag series that doesn't

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.200 
from the dart tag series that doesn't
have<00:02:11.360> any<00:02:11.510> railings<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.440> its<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.730> quite<00:02:14.000> big

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
have any railings on its it's quite big

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.120 
have any railings on its it's quite big
and<00:02:14.420> actually<00:02:14.720> quite<00:02:14.930> heavy<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> pistol<00:02:16.010> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and actually quite heavy for a pistol I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.230 
and actually quite heavy for a pistol I
would<00:02:16.280> say<00:02:16.460> but<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:16.970> you're<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.150> to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
would say but if you're going to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.750 
would say but if you're going to
one-hand<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.930> guess<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:18.590> fine<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.520> mean

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
one-hand it I guess it's fine but I mean

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.510 
one-hand it I guess it's fine but I mean
it's<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.450> little<00:02:20.690> bit<00:02:20.840> heavy<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:22.340> not

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's a little bit heavy so it's not

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.850 
it's a little bit heavy so it's not
really<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:23.270> pistol<00:02:24.140> I<00:02:24.230> guess<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> could<00:02:24.620> say<00:02:24.770> it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
really a pistol I guess I could say it's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.630 
really a pistol I guess I could say it's
more<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.280> rightful<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.950> let's<00:02:28.370> give<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
more like it rightful so let's give the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.090 
more like it rightful so let's give the
pros<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.180> cons<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.660> skin<00:02:29.870> i<00:02:29.900> guess<00:02:30.200> first<00:02:30.920> of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
pros and cons the skin i guess first of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.730 
pros and cons the skin i guess first of
all<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> pros<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.670> skin<00:02:32.120> has<00:02:32.360> its<00:02:32.570> full<00:02:33.560> auto

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
all the pros the skin has its full auto

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.410 
all the pros the skin has its full auto
which<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.100> pretty<00:02:34.220> nice<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:35.270> pull

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
which is pretty nice you can just pull

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.830 
which is pretty nice you can just pull
the<00:02:35.510> trigger<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.810> start<00:02:36.320> shooting<00:02:37.720> also<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the trigger and start shooting also the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.000 
the trigger and start shooting also the
range<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.230> pretty<00:02:39.290> nice<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:40.580> are<00:02:40.700> no<00:02:40.850> AR

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
range is pretty nice there are no AR

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.040 
range is pretty nice there are no AR
individual<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.160> RS<00:02:43.460> per<00:02:43.790> each<00:02:43.940> gun<00:02:44.270> there's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
individual a RS per each gun there's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.920 
individual a RS per each gun there's
only<00:02:45.170> an<00:02:45.380> AR<00:02:45.820> for<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.910> actual<00:02:47.240> shooting

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
only an AR for the actual shooting

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.230 
only an AR for the actual shooting
mechanism<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.160> darts<00:02:49.580> won't<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:49.970> pushed

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
mechanism so the darts won't get pushed

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.050 
mechanism so the darts won't get pushed
forwards<00:02:50.780> which<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.080> pretty<00:02:51.290> nice<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:52.610> mean

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
forwards which is pretty nice I mean

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.120 
forwards which is pretty nice I mean
some<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.690> lot<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.080> other<00:02:54.440> guns<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.950> put

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
some of a lot of other guns and you put

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.820 
some of a lot of other guns and you put
a<00:02:55.370> dart<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> front<00:02:56.570> push<00:02:57.260> forwards<00:02:57.710> and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
a dart on the front push forwards and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.060 
a dart on the front push forwards and
you<00:02:57.920> can't<00:02:58.160> fired<00:02:58.910> because<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.410> AR<00:03:00.770> isn't

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you can't fired because it the AR isn't

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.050 
you can't fired because it the AR isn't
activated<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.440> pretty<00:03:03.650> nice<00:03:04.000> for<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
activated so that's pretty nice for the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.720 
activated so that's pretty nice for the
cons<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.720> gun<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.310> little<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.580> heavy

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
cons of this gun it's a little bit heavy

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.340 
cons of this gun it's a little bit heavy
for<00:03:08.000> pistol<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.570> guess<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.810> could<00:03:08.870> say<00:03:09.050> again

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
for pistol I guess you could say again

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.710 
for pistol I guess you could say again
yeah<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.890> it's<00:03:10.010> more<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> really<00:03:11.330> small

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
yeah so it's more like a really small

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.550 
yeah so it's more like a really small
rifle<00:03:12.610> also<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> response<00:03:14.150> time<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.750> how

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
rifle also the response time and how

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.560 
rifle also the response time and how
slow<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.160> fires<00:03:17.260> quite<00:03:18.459> slow<00:03:19.459> as<00:03:20.239> soon<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.450> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
slow it fires quite slow as soon as you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.300 
slow it fires quite slow as soon as you
pull<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> trigger<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.290> takes<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> second<00:03:22.190> or

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
pull a trigger it takes like a second or

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.660 
pull a trigger it takes like a second or
a<00:03:22.340> half-second<00:03:22.850> at<00:03:22.940> least<00:03:23.260> 42<00:03:24.260> fired<00:03:24.530> art<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.370> I

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
a half-second at least 42 fired art so I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.400 
a half-second at least 42 fired art so I
mean<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.030> kind<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.330> wouldn't<00:03:27.140> be<00:03:27.200> able<00:03:27.260> to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
mean you kind of wouldn't be able to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.530 
mean you kind of wouldn't be able to
shoot<00:03:27.620> as<00:03:27.860> quick<00:03:28.070> as<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> good<00:03:28.910> my

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
shoot as quick as you can with a good my

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.960 
shoot as quick as you can with a good my
personal<00:03:29.810> opinion<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:30.350> like<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.820> it's

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
personal opinion I like it I think it's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.650 
personal opinion I like it I think it's
the<00:03:32.660> same<00:03:32.930> thing<00:03:32.959> as<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> speed<00:03:34.190> swarm<00:03:34.580> so<00:03:35.270> I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the same thing as a speed swarm so I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.560 
the same thing as a speed swarm so I
like<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.260> gun<00:03:36.500> however<00:03:37.300> there<00:03:38.300> are<00:03:38.420> some

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
like this gun however there are some

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.390 
like this gun however there are some
cons<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.080> but<00:03:39.830> let's<00:03:39.980> get<00:03:40.070> into<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
cons to it but let's get into the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400 
cons to it but let's get into the
shooting<00:03:40.700> test<00:03:41.000> alright<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:41.840> we<00:03:41.930> lined<00:03:42.170> up<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
shooting test alright so we lined up the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.560 
shooting test alright so we lined up the
real<00:03:42.590> we've<00:03:42.800> got<00:03:42.920> 40<00:03:43.250> feet<00:03:43.370> lined<00:03:43.610> up<00:03:43.790> and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
real we've got 40 feet lined up and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:56.289 
real we've got 40 feet lined up and
let's<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.080> shooting

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.490 

alright<00:03:57.299> so<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.689> range<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.170> gun<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
alright so for the range of this gun the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.309 
alright so for the range of this gun the
dark<00:03:58.709> splendid<00:03:59.129> from<00:03:59.579> around<00:03:59.790> 33<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.810> door

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
dark splendid from around 33 to the door

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.130 
dark splendid from around 33 to the door
so<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.099> probably<00:04:02.400> reached<00:04:02.700> maybe<00:04:02.909> 45<00:04:03.450> maybe<00:04:03.870> 50

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
so it probably reached maybe 45 maybe 50

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.500 
so it probably reached maybe 45 maybe 50
feet<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:05.609> effective<00:04:05.939> range<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.299> gun<00:04:06.480> is

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
feet the effective range in this gun is

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.479 
feet the effective range in this gun is
probably<00:04:06.870> around<00:04:07.019> 23<00:04:07.799> feet<00:04:07.980> because<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
probably around 23 feet because of the

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.509 
probably around 23 feet because of the
accuracy<00:04:09.469> I'd<00:04:10.469> say<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.799> gun<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:11.010> much<00:04:11.280> more

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
accuracy I'd say this gun is much more
