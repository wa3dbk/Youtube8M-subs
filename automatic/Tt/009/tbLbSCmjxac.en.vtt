00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 good morning 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.320
 my name is lorenzo bellini i am a 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.480
 architect 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.599
 we are inside the stand 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:25.520
 of the servant at the furniture fair of 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:28.150
 milano I am sitting in an armchair that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.699
 I designed for this new collection 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:36.860
 world what we wanted to do with 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:43.190
 the for freezes is to create one 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:45.079
 intimate space enclosed by working the two 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 wood materials the skin that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.390
 constitute the fundamental elements 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.110
 then I thought of the whole collection 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.110
 first of all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.150
 create let's say relationships between the various 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.140
 materials in this case the wood and the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 leather worked in a more modern way 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.830
 lines are more pulled less rounded and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.400
 starting from these details 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.250
 I wanted to think of how to carry 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.820
 this concept also on the mobile on 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.620
 sideboard on the table on all 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 objects that eventually do 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.759
 part of this collection 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.070
 starting from the bergÃ¨re I drew 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.840
 already for the forest and this is the third that 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.740
 we designed one at the same time 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.890
 with downtown another for the merlin dom 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.170
 in which c 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.290
 we turned to the past with an eye to the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.990
 present in this case we wanted 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.110
 starting from the present go more towards the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.110
 future
