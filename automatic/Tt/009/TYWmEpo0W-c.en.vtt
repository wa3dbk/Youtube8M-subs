00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.410
 yes that's hard to come by 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.100
 the german keyboard version for the 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.660
 samsung galaxy note 10.1 what offers 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.059
 this keyboard as already at 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.570
 samsung is usually the charging port on the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.029
 on the back side a jack connection 35 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.160
 mm for exit into catch a 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.480
 stereo around the hub then music 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.369
 what else do we have for play 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.910
 buttons that are specific we have 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.149
 ahead 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.890
 the home button the multitasking button 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.350
 for multiple applications to control that 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.420
 Unfortunately, Internet mail does not yet report 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.860
 possible google mail as standard mail 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.500
 to set up something I do not particularly like 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 Great find the attitude for the 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.050
 manual volume and the mp3 player 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.059
 Often also criticized is that the systems 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.860
 keyboard on point when you are in the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.989
 Internet moves and moves something 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.329
 you want to be able to write this one completely 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.160
 I'll show you away easily 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.110
 annoying you right now with this key 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.029
 but sometimes I have to do a bit 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.499
 confess so I can do that from now on 

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.170
 lock the sports key very quickly 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.079
 work also unlock a cup 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.389
 for example, and off you go 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.130
 yes, what else is there to say with 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:19.420
 The keyboard is always something actually 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.369
 Until recently, youtube was with me 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.380
 only the small screen to see if 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.420
 you have a video played the city 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.039
 apparently changed after the last one 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.749
 update 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.219
 I have the opportunity now is also great 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.169
 that was a point of me to stand 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.639
 very annoyed but the last 

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:36.639
 update now fixed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.200
 the loudness would seduces the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.320
 look further 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 so now I'm in an area where I am 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.119
 want to take something and you see say 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.880
 nothing pressed and already appears 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.680
 system keyboard something annoying she is 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.090
 also a changed form than usual and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.360
 so probably standard I see 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.060
 You can press it by pressing the small button 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.590
 I have hair on several sides 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.330
 disappear or come and go 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.190
 to let 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.080
 corrosive because every time this function 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.420
 must do because every time this 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.640
 high so I take on facebook 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.310
 I want to write something clear here 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.310
 Now the system keyboard comes on again 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:57.730
 pushing this way naturally sucks 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:03:00.069
 and of course I write something very much 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.950
 nice how can i find myself on the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.569
 Homescreen quite normal I can through 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.170
 simply press any key to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:13.870
 activate google immediately and you can 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.799
 I'm looking for something wrong 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.260
 would like the ingenious keyboard for 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.049
 the not 10.1 is the use of the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.660
 offers plug the otto steiger comes 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.640
 usually on the bottom 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.989
 Of course, you want the device 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.890
 device would now stand this 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.150
 naturally kink plug and immense 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.520
 I can not do that any more rationally 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.470
 use 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.060
 or will damage the connector for life 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.180
 I can use this plug of the charger 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 introduce the side and functions LEGO 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.600
 in a case now a mouse easily 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.600
 use 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 a really download function over 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.240
 one can also have several devices 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.950
 at the same time drifting on the wallpaper and 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.380
 Actually, there are hardly any limits 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.560
 when working with the tab a nice 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.560
 Thing
