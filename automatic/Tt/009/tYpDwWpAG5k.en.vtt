00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone in today's video, I would 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 wanted to talk about the carburetor on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.690
 139qmb engine 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 1 scooter and today I purchased a new one 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.580
 coordinator and faced such 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.210
 problem and reset momentum 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.320
 so I began to think why 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.320
 first checked the gas cable 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 tugged means gas knob 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.020
 the flap returns to the place 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.210
 carburetor removed flushed all washed 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.750
 cleared 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 collected but the problem did not disappear means that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 I undertook began to regulate the quality 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.420
 mixtures 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.770
 I know how much I can see here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 the artist is not visible 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 so I started the scooter 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 completely all the way and began to turn away 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.150
 little by little 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.500
 and I got about two with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.689
 half three turns I twisted and all 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 the problem disappeared ie it so 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.820
 what was going too enriched mixture 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.990
 here and he for this is not for some miracle 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.990
 we did not lose turnover 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.899
 so guys before you climb and in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.259
 cable there start to twist there 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.909
 carburetor back and forth even 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.890
 as far as he finishes because 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.369
 that when you buy it at the factory usually 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.250
 spins a turn there and a half that's it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.320
 as if the stock setting but for each 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.759
 carburetor for each carburetor 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.759
 setting goes like its separate this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 tell individually what before 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.000
 place check 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.840
 screw quality mix how much you it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.690
 off turns if you have the same 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 problem happens 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.140
 just try the opposite there for one 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.299
 turn there and a half out 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.750
 I think the problem is simply not in this 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:24.110
 such a small video will disappear 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 tuning carburetor all bye
