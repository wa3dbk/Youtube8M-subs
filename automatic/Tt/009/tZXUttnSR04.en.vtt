00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.550 
fantastic just as they did when they
walk<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> they're<00:01:54.720> ready<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> go<00:01:55.229> straight

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
walk in and they're ready to go straight

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.959 
walk in and they're ready to go straight
to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> operating<00:01:56.219> room<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.729> come

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
to the operating room when they come

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.999 
to the operating room when they come
back<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.930> morning<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.320> surgery<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
back on the morning of surgery the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.580 
back on the morning of surgery the
patient<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.579> shows<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.530> instead<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
patient then shows up and instead of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
patient then shows up and instead of
going<00:02:01.799> through<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> localization<00:02:02.729> process

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going through the localization process

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.069 
going through the localization process
etc<00:02:03.840> she<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.560> go<00:02:04.740> directly<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.700> surgery<00:02:06.240> which

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
etc she can go directly to surgery which

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.160 
etc she can go directly to surgery which
really<00:02:07.439> shortens<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.819> procedure<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
really shortens the procedure and the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.590 
really shortens the procedure and the
day<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.709> her<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.459> experience<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.239> the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
day for her and the experience on the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.940 
day for her and the experience on the
a<00:02:12.630> surgery<00:02:13.760> when<00:02:14.760> she<00:02:14.790> shows<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.480> surgery

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
a surgery when she shows up in surgery

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
a surgery when she shows up in surgery
we<00:02:16.950> put<00:02:17.220> her<00:02:17.400> off<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.940> sleep<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.320> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
we put her off to sleep and we have a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.640 
we put her off to sleep and we have a
handheld<00:02:20.280> probe<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.180> picks<00:02:21.600> up<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> signal

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
handheld probe that picks up the signal

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.960 
handheld probe that picks up the signal
emitted<00:02:23.310> by<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.910> chip<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:25.980> use<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.730> probe

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
emitted by the chip and we use the probe

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.140 
emitted by the chip and we use the probe
to<00:02:27.330> find<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.200> signal<00:02:28.650> make<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> small<00:02:29.730> incision

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
to find the signal make a small incision

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.600 
to find the signal make a small incision
right<00:02:30.600> where<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> signal<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.620> emitted<00:02:31.770> follow

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
right where the signal is emitted follow

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.420 
right where the signal is emitted follow
that<00:02:32.880> signal<00:02:33.120> down<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:34.050> really

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that signal down and that's really

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
that signal down and that's really
corresponding<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> area<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.270> concern<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
corresponding to the area of concern the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.560 
corresponding to the area of concern the
cancer<00:02:37.350> or<00:02:37.530> abnormality<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.850> remove<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
cancer or abnormality we remove that and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.180 
cancer or abnormality we remove that and
the<00:02:39.660> patient<00:02:40.050> goes<00:02:40.080> home<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.590> chip<00:02:40.860> comes

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the patient goes home and the chip comes

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.850 
the patient goes home and the chip comes
out<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> cancer<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.230> with<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
out with the cancer or with the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.890 
out with the cancer or with the
abnormality<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.850> we've<00:02:44.970> removed<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.630> wound

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
abnormality that we've removed the wound

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.090 
abnormality that we've removed the wound
has<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.230> closed<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> patient<00:02:46.980> goes

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
has then closed then the patient goes

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.970 
has then closed then the patient goes
home<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.490> day<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:49.020> very<00:02:49.290> easy<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
home that day so it's very easy on the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.550 
home that day so it's very easy on the
surgeon<00:02:50.460> very<00:02:50.940> easy<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> patient<00:02:52.410> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
surgeon very easy on the patient in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.350 
surgeon very easy on the patient in
terms<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.890> shortening<00:02:53.280> her<00:02:53.580> experience<00:02:54.180> on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
terms of shortening her experience on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
terms of shortening her experience on
the<00:02:54.480> day<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.660> surgery<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.530> seed<00:02:56.100> localization

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the day of surgery the seed localization

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.380 
the day of surgery the seed localization
process<00:02:58.250> epitomizes<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.610> kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> care

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
process epitomizes that kind of care

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
process epitomizes that kind of care
that<00:03:00.420> we're<00:03:00.810> trying<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.290> give<00:03:01.470> today's<00:03:02.460> day
