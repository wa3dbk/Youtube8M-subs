00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
far as I'm were in World War two and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.840 
far as I'm were in World War two and
will<00:04:01.330> no<00:04:01.660> one<00:04:01.810> lagged<00:04:02.080> out<00:04:02.670> because<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.760> will

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
will no one lagged out because it will

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.610 
will no one lagged out because it will
be<00:04:03.970> pretty<00:04:04.270> ridiculous<00:04:04.990> I'm<00:04:05.500> probably

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
be pretty ridiculous I'm probably

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.710 
be pretty ridiculous I'm probably
getting<00:04:05.830> fucked<00:04:06.160> about<00:04:06.490> by<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.790> explosions
