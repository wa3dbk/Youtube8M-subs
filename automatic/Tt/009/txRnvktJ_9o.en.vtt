00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the new version is that this version

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
the new version is that this version
when<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.410> Raven<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.010> created<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
when the Raven is created so is the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970 
when the Raven is created so is the
ground<00:00:39.420> control<00:00:39.809> station<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.950> see

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
ground control station there you can see

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
ground control station there you can see
I<00:00:41.100> picked<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.600> I'm<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.020> picking<00:00:43.260> up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
and I'm going to go over to the ground

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.290 
and I'm going to go over to the ground
control<00:01:10.330> station<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.350> can<00:01:11.470> see<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
control station and you can see the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.480 
control station and you can see the
interface<00:01:13.300> for<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.590> camera<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.250> stuff<00:01:15.370> like

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
interface for the camera and stuff like

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.360 
interface for the camera and stuff like
that<00:01:15.550> is<00:01:15.880> now<00:01:16.150> onto<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.140> ground<00:01:18.070> control

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
that is now onto the ground control

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.420 
that is now onto the ground control
station

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
station

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
station
the<00:01:20.970> nice<00:01:21.150> thing<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.050> actually<00:01:22.320> use

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the nice thing is is I can actually use

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.430 
the nice thing is is I can actually use
the<00:01:22.800> arrow<00:01:22.980> keys<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.310> move<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.630> target<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
the arrow keys to move the target of

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.220 
the arrow keys to move the target of
interest<00:01:26.270> basically<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> marker<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
interest basically it's a marker on the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.890 
interest basically it's a marker on the
map<00:01:28.260> which<00:01:28.710> corresponds<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.940> position<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
map which corresponds to a position in

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.050 
map which corresponds to a position in
the<00:01:30.990> game<00:01:31.200> world<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.790> arrow

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the game world and if I use the arrow

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
the game world and if I use the arrow
keys<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:34.370> can<00:01:35.370> move<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.120> marker<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:37.440> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
keys I can move that marker on to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
keys I can move that marker on to
different<00:01:37.860> parts<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.930> map<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.000> up

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
different parts of the the map so the up

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
different parts of the the map so the up
arrow<00:01:42.270> key<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.750> North<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.130> arrow

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
arrow key is for North the down arrow

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.820 
arrow key is for North the down arrow
key<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.850> South<00:01:45.090> left<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:45.900> for<00:01:46.140> west<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
key is for South left is for west and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.780 
key is for South left is for west and
right<00:01:46.979> as<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.220> use<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.610> pretty

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right as we use it's pretty

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.650 
right as we use it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:49.979> also<00:01:50.100> hit<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
self-explanatory you can also hit up and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.900 
self-explanatory you can also hit up and
left<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.680> Northwest<00:01:53.399> like

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
left if you want to go Northwest like

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.850 
left if you want to go Northwest like
I'm<00:01:54.060> doing<00:01:54.360> well<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.740> I'm

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
I'm doing well actually and here I'm

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.070 
I'm doing well actually and here I'm
going<00:01:56.040> southeast<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.970> I'm<00:01:57.060> hitting<00:01:57.330> down<00:01:57.600> into

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
going southeast so I'm hitting down into

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080 
going southeast so I'm hitting down into
the<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.560> same<00:01:58.770> time<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.850> you're<00:02:00.000> not

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the right at the same time so you're not

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.210 
the right at the same time so you're not
locked<00:02:00.390> into<00:02:00.600> doing<00:02:01.140> only<00:02:01.530> northern<00:02:01.979> only

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
locked into doing only northern only

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.130 
locked into doing only northern only
south<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.729> only<00:02:02.820> west<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.360> east<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> do

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
south or only west or east you can do

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.490 
south or only west or east you can do
about<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.500> same<00:02:04.680> time<00:02:04.710> which<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.160> really<00:02:05.369> nice

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
about the same time which is really nice

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.950 
about the same time which is really nice
something<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.190> didn't<00:02:07.430> actually<00:02:07.960> anticipate

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
something I didn't actually anticipate

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.250 
something I didn't actually anticipate
working

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.479 

so<00:02:12.830> here<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.549> am<00:02:13.730> following<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:15.099> boat<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.459> I

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
so here I am following this boat and I

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.539 
so here I am following this boat and I
just<00:02:17.420> made<00:02:17.689> this<00:02:17.780> little<00:02:18.079> mission<00:02:18.430> kind<00:02:19.430> of

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
just made this little mission kind of

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.179 
just made this little mission kind of
based<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:20.409> real-world<00:02:21.409> missions<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:22.069> I've

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
based on real-world missions that I've

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.740 
based on real-world missions that I've
seen<00:02:22.489> UAVs<00:02:23.329> used<00:02:23.689> for<00:02:24.400> such<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.750> drug

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
seen UAVs used for such as drug

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.470 
seen UAVs used for such as drug
interdiction<00:02:27.640> types<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.790> missions<00:02:28.970> where

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
interdiction types of missions where

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.949 
interdiction types of missions where
there's<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.440> boat<00:02:31.190> moving<00:02:31.670> offshore<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.870> it

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
there's a boat moving offshore and it

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.949 
there's a boat moving offshore and it
has<00:02:33.079> drugs<00:02:33.409> in<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.360> use<00:02:35.360> these<00:02:35.569> unmanned

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
has drugs in it and use these unmanned

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.290 
has drugs in it and use these unmanned
aerial<00:02:36.349> vehicles<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.069> track<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> boats

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.600 

here<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.370> flying<00:02:44.370> over<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:46.080> boats<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.010> one

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
here I'm flying over the boats and one

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.010 
here I'm flying over the boats and one
of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> nice<00:02:47.880> things<00:02:47.910> about<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.510> new<00:02:48.630> camera

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
of the nice things about this new camera

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.350 
of the nice things about this new camera
system<00:02:49.050> is<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.770> when<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.240> camera<00:02:51.240> over

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
system is that when the camera over

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.200 
system is that when the camera over
flies<00:02:51.690> something<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:53.220> looks<00:02:53.640> off<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
flies something it looks off to the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.930 
flies something it looks off to the
right<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.890> normally<00:02:56.250> could<00:02:56.370> only<00:02:56.490> look<00:02:56.730> off

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
right when normally could only look off

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.540 
right when normally could only look off
to<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> left<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.590> old<00:02:58.920> version<00:02:59.130> could<00:02:59.430> do

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
to the left the old version could do

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.500 
to the left the old version could do
that<00:02:59.790> also<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.440> fake<00:03:01.740> but<00:03:02.270> now<00:03:03.270> when

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that also but it was fake but now when

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.770 
that also but it was fake but now when
it<00:03:03.600> does<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.080> realistic

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.090 

here<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:08.930> moving<00:03:09.290> behind<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.830> boats<00:03:10.070> and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
here I'm moving behind the boats and

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.590 
here I'm moving behind the boats and
approaching<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> rear<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
approaching it from the rear and the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.280 
approaching it from the rear and the
camera<00:03:15.020> can<00:03:15.440> can

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
camera can can

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.400 
camera can can
move<00:03:16.590> forward<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
move forward to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.650 
move forward to
target<00:03:19.310> whatever<00:03:19.580> you're<00:03:19.700> looking<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:20.120> again

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
target whatever you're looking at again

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.240 
target whatever you're looking at again
the<00:03:20.780> old<00:03:20.930> version<00:03:21.080> could<00:03:21.320> do<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.560> also<00:03:21.800> but

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
the old version could do this also but

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.800 
the old version could do this also but
it<00:03:22.370> wasn't<00:03:22.610> very<00:03:22.700> realistic<00:03:23.330> now<00:03:23.540> it's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
it wasn't very realistic now it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.630 
it wasn't very realistic now it's
totally<00:03:24.020> realistic<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.920> meant<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.340> from

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
totally realistic and I meant it from

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:35.860 
totally realistic and I meant it from
the<00:03:25.700> beginning

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.949 

when<00:03:36.409> you<00:03:36.530> move<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.099> camera<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:38.510> any

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
when you move the camera in any

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.990 
when you move the camera in any
direction<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:40.280> get<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.640> indicator<00:03:40.909> on

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
direction you get a little indicator on

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.640 
direction you get a little indicator on
the<00:03:41.090> screen<00:03:41.390> that<00:03:41.510> says<00:03:41.720> it's<00:03:41.900> like<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.530> this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the screen that says it's like in this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.979 
the screen that says it's like in this
case<00:03:42.709> slewing<00:03:43.430> west<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.480> actually<00:03:44.659> moved

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
case slewing west so I actually moved

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.780 
case slewing west so I actually moved
the<00:03:45.080> camera<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:45.470> bit<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.920> west<00:03:45.950> at

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
the camera a little bit to the west at

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.390 
the camera a little bit to the west at
the<00:03:46.909> end<00:03:47.060> there<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.290> says<00:03:48.709> which

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the end there and so it says which

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.820 
the end there and so it says which
direction<00:03:49.760> you're<00:03:50.030> moving<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.390> camera<00:03:50.599> in

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
direction you're moving the camera in

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.330 
direction you're moving the camera in
it's<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.550> little<00:03:52.940> funky<00:03:53.150> when<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.800> UAV

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
it's a little funky when the the UAV

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.580 
it's a little funky when the the UAV
starts<00:03:55.700> circling<00:03:55.970> an<00:03:56.270> area<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.380> might

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
starts circling an area and you might

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.180 
starts circling an area and you might
lose<00:03:57.860> your<00:03:58.030> sense<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.120> direction<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:01.040> might

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
lose your sense of direction you might

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.590 
lose your sense of direction you might
want<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.490> you<00:04:01.850> know<00:04:01.940> move<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.210> camera<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.570> the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
want to you know move the camera to the

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.910 
want to you know move the camera to the
left<00:04:02.690> right<00:04:02.930> now<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:03.350> then<00:04:03.470> move<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.740> left

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
left right now and then move the left

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.560 
left right now and then move the left
arrow<00:04:04.100> key<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.550> really<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:04.970> want<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.240> move<00:04:05.420> it

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
arrow key but really you want to move it

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.730 
arrow key but really you want to move it
northeast<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.070> want<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.490> hit<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:09.410> up<00:04:09.560> and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
northeast so you want to hit the up and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.500 
northeast so you want to hit the up and
the<00:04:09.830> right<00:04:10.040> arrow<00:04:10.280> keys<00:04:10.580> if<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:10.970> want<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.270> move

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.720 

I'm<00:04:31.560> just<00:04:31.740> lining<00:04:32.100> up<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.340> camera<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.700> little

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
I'm just lining up the camera a little

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.060 
I'm just lining up the camera a little
bit<00:04:32.970> better

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
bit better

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.650 
bit better
just<00:04:34.250> get<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.430> better<00:04:34.610> view<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:35.210> what's<00:04:35.480> going

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
just get a better view of what's going

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.420 
just get a better view of what's going
on<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:36.020> this<00:04:36.110> place

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.980 

I've<00:04:43.030> also<00:04:43.180> changed<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.600> few<00:04:43.750> other<00:04:43.900> things

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
I've also changed a few other things

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.540 
I've also changed a few other things
that<00:04:44.470> some<00:04:44.650> people<00:04:44.680> had<00:04:44.920> reported<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.340> me<00:04:45.460> were

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
that some people had reported to me were

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.880 
that some people had reported to me were
causing<00:04:45.730> some<00:04:46.030> problems<00:04:46.150> such<00:04:46.660> as<00:04:46.890> this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
causing some problems such as this

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.770 
causing some problems such as this
baseball<00:04:48.430> element<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.060> was<00:04:49.180> using<00:04:49.390> for

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
baseball element that I was using for

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.320 
baseball element that I was using for
the<00:04:50.170> strobe<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.890> got<00:04:51.280> rid<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.610> baseball<00:04:51.790> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
the strobe I got rid of the baseball and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.630 
the strobe I got rid of the baseball and
I<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:53.050> had<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:53.290> light<00:04:53.470> point<00:04:53.800> happen<00:04:54.430> right

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
I just had the light point happen right

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.320 
I just had the light point happen right
on<00:04:54.850> top<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.510> Ravens<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:57.180> hopefully<00:04:58.180> that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
on top of the Ravens so hopefully that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.420 
on top of the Ravens so hopefully that
will<00:04:58.450> cause<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.560> last<00:04:59.650> problems<00:05:00.220> in

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
will cause the last problems in

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.860 
will cause the last problems in
multiplayer<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:01.180> doesn't<00:05:01.360> have<00:05:01.450> any<00:05:01.570> problems

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
multiplayer it doesn't have any problems

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.140 
multiplayer it doesn't have any problems
in<00:05:01.990> single<00:05:02.290> player<00:05:02.320> but<00:05:02.770> with<00:05:03.490> multiplayer

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
in single player but with multiplayer

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:24.999 
in single player but with multiplayer
it<00:05:05.540> was<00:05:05.660> creating<00:05:06.020> some<00:05:06.200> crashing<00:05:06.770> issues

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.309 

so<00:05:25.430> here<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.909> target<00:05:26.389> boat<00:05:26.569> is<00:05:26.749> meeting<00:05:27.169> up

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
so here the target boat is meeting up

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.790 
so here the target boat is meeting up
with<00:05:27.619> another<00:05:28.339> boat<00:05:28.610> out<00:05:29.180> on<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.419> horizon

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.309 

the<00:05:34.389> camera<00:05:35.389> zoom<00:05:35.599> functions<00:05:36.050> are<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.229> same

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
the camera zoom functions are the same

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.300 
the camera zoom functions are the same
as<00:05:36.680> before<00:05:37.810> using<00:05:38.810> X<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.349> C<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.770> zoom<00:05:39.949> in<00:05:40.159> and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
as before using X and C to zoom in and

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.820 
as before using X and C to zoom in and
zoom<00:05:40.370> out<00:05:40.659> you<00:05:41.659> can<00:05:41.780> also<00:05:41.900> still<00:05:42.289> change<00:05:42.590> the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
zoom out you can also still change the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.520 
zoom out you can also still change the
elevation<00:05:43.009> of<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.879> camera<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.509> or<00:05:45.259> of<00:05:45.409> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
using WN house change altitude

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.570 
using WN house change altitude
and<00:05:53.600> you<00:05:53.720> can<00:05:53.840> still<00:05:53.960> change<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:55.130> radius

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
and you can still change the the radius

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.270 
and you can still change the the radius

kind<00:06:18.750> of<00:06:18.780> a<00:06:18.900> nice<00:06:19.280> side<00:06:20.280> note<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:21.139> data<00:06:22.139> stream

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
kind of a nice side note the data stream

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.770 
kind of a nice side note the data stream
on<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.860> bottom<00:06:23.400> right<00:06:23.610> part<00:06:24.360> of<00:06:24.419> your<00:06:24.540> screen

on the bottom right part of your screen

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.890 
on the bottom right part of your screen
is<00:06:25.370> much<00:06:26.370> faster<00:06:26.580> used<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.180> be<00:06:27.270> updated<00:06:27.660> once

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
is much faster used to be updated once

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.170 
is much faster used to be updated once
every<00:06:28.260> half<00:06:28.380> second<00:06:28.830> now<00:06:28.919> it's<00:06:29.070> updated<00:06:29.940> once

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
every half second now it's updated once

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.390 
every half second now it's updated once
every<00:06:30.600> tenth<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.290> a<00:06:31.380> second<00:06:31.740> so<00:06:32.220> it's

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
every tenth of a second so it's

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.760 
every tenth of a second so it's
basically<00:06:32.720> updating<00:06:33.720> in<00:06:33.810> real<00:06:33.840> time<00:06:34.169> or<00:06:34.440> close

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770
