00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.760
 hi hi dear friends with you a 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.820
 my day is 21 and today we continue 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.820
 talk about new japanese today 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.099
 we have type 95 x ha is a light tank 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.630
 level two he shares the usual 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.189
 to build with what is not about you 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.380
 quite recently told unusually 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.529
 is that it is larger 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.140
 although the class is easy but at the same time everyone 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.060
 pretty moving we have 16 seven horses 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.029
 per ton much higher than average 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.010
 Tank well understandable and two guns and with them 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.140
 Generally interesting in the first guns 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.570
 which is howitzers short and she 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.539
 It looks like this is how it is and how 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.399
 teach does not have the same all the parameters 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.649
 i.e., rather high one-time damage 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.230
 low armor penetration and speed 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.570
 flight of 355 meters is very small 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 there is difficult vytselivat distance especially on 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.980
 moving targets 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.410
 best of all and here especially become better 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.159
 here is this gun which is 30 millimeter 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.109
 usually its flight speed is 580 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.870
 meters per second very fast convergence 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.850
 pretty accurate and pretty pretty 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.500
 armor penetration figures are the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.030
 I liked it the country with the gun and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.340
 what is not that this tanchik 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.070
 in their aggregates much more 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.770
 Cheerful should be than his average 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.680
 classmate but true dash no give 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.440
 really understand the battle that the enemies of good 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.360
 friends so that's all why because 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.160
 how much did i ride it though you can 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.170
 not be so many fights but every 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210
 of them every fight was like this 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.400
 feeling that when all klest all 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.920
 like with this tank no need 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.710
 fight no need to know its thin 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.870
 soul fibers when there is one place better on 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.890
 it does not take occupies another tank and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.190
 there so time 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.310
 lyysyak through god through board through roof 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.100
 over your head over your shoulder everything is easier here 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.990
 why yes because he rides 40 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
 kilometers maximum speed and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.940
 molotov and engine powerful enough 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 here on the total mass is obtained at 16 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.680
 IS-7 per horse per ton very quickly 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.540
 speaker 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.090
 maybe he is not in such maneuvers 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.220
 good but these are nuances the main thing is that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.740
 still all the same it is important to know that armor 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.200
 there are no altogether at all 12 millimeters 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.570
 this is the tons the fattest in the forehead 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 shell plate 12 me even plate it and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.480
 call it 25 millimeters this is armor 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.850
 frontal turret and mask 35 this 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.670
 the only place you can somehow 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.530
 fight tank but it is with reservation 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.880
 machine gunners because everyone else 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.880
 guns punch Hubble yesterday 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.650
 ok here t7 his anger went out calmly 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.959
 leave the whole team pick up like this 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 times it is all played and by the way t7 if 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.570
 I would raise I left would be riddled 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.880
 to the holes 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.370
 would have destroyed quite myself because 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 the body is very, very loose 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.110
 that's what i need for happiness 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.610
 sometimes well honestly here it seems to be 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.410
 you play then throw the eighth levels 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.550
 a dozen just want to call 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.400
 some kind of fight 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.920
 low level 2 3 and just drive 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 and here is the new Japanese just as if I 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.470
 I take this opportunity and run them in and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.480
 I am relaxing combining the move in general so in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 palms lay down well as if their idea 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.400
 on it all the time went comfortable gun 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.410
 bends down by 15 it's just due 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.600
 Now what's the reason to talk 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.280
 about all his make-up quirks related to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.950
 pickup angles where there is a good position 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.410
 for defense and all of them can be slaughtered and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.799
 here the same topic is channeled but local 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.959
 perhaps but that the size of the tower from whom he 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.120
 impressive enough unlike che 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.489
 she and here already so simple and you will not potankuesh 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.180
 but you can try not torture 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.280
 quite to yourself sometimes can be out of luck 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.350
 that is, I personally adore such tanchiki 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.570
 who chase who even though there at all 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.640
 was not quite a few no I already like 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.769
 would be more or less used to playing carefully 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.140
 Deval as they say not to be substituted 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.420
 once again and here every time practice and 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.829
 the same thing here drove to the mines in 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.620
 slide, who was the first one to stand up and sneakers 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.390
 everyone here has already been interrupted by the battle itself 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.090
 honestly some kind of scientific 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.430
 value is not just here 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.900
 such a typical easy relaxing game 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.610
 under and light relaxing music 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.530
 which I recommend you should put 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.570
 when you play and you will be the most 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.220
 better mood because that's it 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.109
 here are tanchiki 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.690
 typical agu true enemy he is not 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.420
 just decided to be mine in time 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.640
 I have my own and I'll take it out 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.709
 a little bit i am driving back because 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.470
 I see that the side starts to fly and time 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.260
 flew once fly barely possible already 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.270
 drive off a little and that's all just everything 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.290
 trite to be honest it's all souls 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.390
 soon I don’t even know what 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.360
 talk about tanchik because in it 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.400
 there are no such cases that need 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.920
 especially know just here turned on the game 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.110
 clicked into battle and went to have fun 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.260
 bend over and here he is all about it in this ho 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.390
 so it’s just that the choice with 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.610
 he has enough tools here too 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.370
 just because with a landmine to and in my opinion 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.020
 on fire a crime because he 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.510
 such dynamic maneuverable all 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.880
 it will be spent so that he especially 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.250
 no one gets there for show 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.260
 while aiming while the projectile is flying all already 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.270
 change and with this gun she 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.290
 Much better than a gun student I you 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.330
 told in the hangar 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.430
 on why because she has a little 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.570
 more breaking through there all such 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.380
 comfort more fun 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.090
 of and in general just all the problems won all 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.660
 worries out of mind 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.070
 there was the last enemy in the team and here 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.290
 I just had time for ours 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.419
 allies snatch and enemies because they 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.060
 also so here we rushed at all 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.730
 they were torn apart by the whole team 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.710
 all this one is a Japanese light tank 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.140
 second level lying course clio 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.480

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.190
 enjoy don't forget to subscribe to 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.600
