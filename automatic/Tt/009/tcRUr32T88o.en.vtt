00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.570
 so I'm serge belais the vet and we'll talk about 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.370
 the first subject of the acquisition of an animal and how to choose your dog 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.569
 the dog is an absolutely prodigious pet it's a 

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:21.969
 presence is a support it's a friend it's patrons and partners who do not 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.680
 not a member of the family 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 the country must stay in its place 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.960
 to choose an animal and therefore his dog must not give in to the criteria 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.919
 fashion 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.910
 he had fashion with the 101 dalmatians of walt disney and after we found 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 three years after thousands of Dalmatian bandoneon sp has 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.879
 there was the fashion of skiing with milk at home 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.329
 calls for hatred currently small bits of elite France who says 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.420
 to be those already a little jack russell tequila in arms 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.860
 so this fashion phenomenon exists one must try to pass over 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.790
 it is also necessary before we will create a climate of company he will know how 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.900
 is composed the family 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.110
 if it's a family with children of many children their age who will 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.380
 to be able to take care of the animal that will be able to take it out because I am a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.030
 of living at home can stay a long time at home but he needs 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060
 also to go out to do his needs 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.619
 a dog we turn 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.640
 this or that type of dog breed 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.670
 not need it is the activity of the sectors of the joint arms of 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.189
 run 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.270
 so we must take all without consideration before making his choice 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 in choosing a pet and granville or in the countryside 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.550
 we will prefer small dogs or trenches 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.950
 we can not say that a little dog is calmer than a grand slam 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.300
 also temperaments function of race much determine the pace of 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.570
 afterlife 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 to speed up then choose your dog do not hesitate to send your 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.870
 Vets hair professional appointments 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.530
 these tips are free 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 we will always be able to say fast abat briard he needs to brush 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.900
 regularly he is a taker 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
 the level of own funds 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.820
 At the time, eric boulay often referred to problems of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 rail 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.350
 the veterinary professional or trainers where he goes we will also be able to 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.290
 give you his indications 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.320
 what was feared if the amount of interest paid he is to charles on 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 classified ads purchases on the internet 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 purchases on some unfortunately tagged are not recommended 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.799
 because we do not know well 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.199
 the origin of the animal we do not start well his health 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.820
 it is often animals they have been transported under conditions 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.760
 doubtful who come from abroad 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 who have not been socialized 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.010
 and if we now complete and veterinary anthony we discover 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.049
 behavior points and so-called warrants 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.810
 sickology camille 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.030
 it is precisely these disorders that have appeared because the animal is not 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.640
 stayed long enough with his mom and that the animal was not this service 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.459
 that's how you find dogs that do not know how to stay 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.359
 house alone 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.450
 who will destroy everything that will make their needs everywhere and who will be 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:53.060
 terrorized so never take a dog before adding 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.440
 8 to 12 weeks 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.879
 take advice from a veterinarian from a professional 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.559
 it is easy to bale said not serious 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:05.680
 there is also to land to an animal the coup de coeur the blow of 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.919
 lightning this pumpo regard also have an idea 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.950
 but this or that type of race and then all of a sudden to discover another 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.140
 there are thousands of animals that are adopted also in shelters 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.469
 which unfortunately are abandoned 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.909
 we do not find that the old demons we find young people we find great 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 small short hairs depolluting female males 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.969
 there too that's why I talk badly of females it'll be part of 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.429
 choice criteria 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.189
 after your pet search 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.960

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.829
 at these heats regularly every six months 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.079
 a dog can be to do these festivities a little bit left to 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.659

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.249
