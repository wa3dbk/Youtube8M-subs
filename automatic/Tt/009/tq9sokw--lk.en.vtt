00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.049 

today<00:00:08.530> there's<00:00:08.920> a<00:00:08.980> lot<00:00:09.130> of<00:00:09.160> weird<00:00:09.519> ways<00:00:09.760> and

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
today there's a lot of weird ways and

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.509 
today there's a lot of weird ways and
people<00:00:10.299> predict<00:00:10.599> the<00:00:10.719> super<00:00:11.049> bowl<00:00:11.230> like<00:00:11.980> a<00:00:12.010> pro

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
people predict the super bowl like a pro

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.949 
people predict the super bowl like a pro
I<00:00:12.730> think<00:00:13.059> this<00:00:13.240> is<00:00:13.420> probably<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:13.780> most

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
I think this is probably the most

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.490 
I think this is probably the most
intelligent<00:00:14.320> I<00:00:14.799> think<00:00:15.580> if<00:00:15.849> if<00:00:16.330> if<00:00:17.110> you<00:00:17.290> try<00:00:17.470> to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
intelligent I think if if if you try to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.670 
intelligent I think if if if you try to
figure<00:00:17.800> it<00:00:17.980> out<00:00:18.599> everybody<00:00:19.599> knows<00:00:19.869> how<00:00:20.439> good

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
figure it out everybody knows how good

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.179 
figure it out everybody knows how good
the<00:00:20.860> Patriots<00:00:21.340> are<00:00:21.550> but<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.529> Giants<00:00:23.830> are

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
the Patriots are but the the Giants are

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.249 
the Patriots are but the the Giants are
so<00:00:24.399> physical<00:00:24.939> anytime<00:00:25.419> you're<00:00:25.689> physically

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
so physical anytime you're physically

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.370 
so physical anytime you're physically
tough<00:00:26.590> and<00:00:26.890> can<00:00:27.880> get<00:00:28.390> after<00:00:28.720> people<00:00:29.110> and<00:00:29.230> knock

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
tough and can get after people and knock

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.139 
tough and can get after people and knock
you<00:00:29.529> around<00:00:29.649> like<00:00:29.950> their<00:00:30.160> defensive<00:00:30.700> like<00:00:30.880> in
