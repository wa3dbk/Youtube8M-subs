they come with a carrying case but
they're<00:00:35.870> in<00:00:36.020> ear<00:00:36.140> headphones<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:36.950> it's<00:00:37.100> sort

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
they're in ear headphones so it's sort

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.520 
they're in ear headphones so it's sort
of<00:00:37.550> easier<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.390> come<00:00:38.629> with<00:00:38.750> accessories<00:00:39.020> for

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

something<00:00:40.190> like<00:00:40.340> that<00:00:40.449> these<00:00:41.449> don't<00:00:41.780> however

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
something like that these don't however

not<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.580> cables<00:02:22.970> I've<00:02:23.690> got<00:02:24.080> four<00:02:24.350> things<00:02:24.590> i

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
not the cables I've got four things i

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.470 
not the cables I've got four things i
really<00:02:24.740> want<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.070> point<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.790> i'm<00:02:26.360> going

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
really want to point out and i'm going

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.420 
really want to point out and i'm going
to<00:02:26.570> start<00:02:26.750> off<00:02:26.810> with<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.050> earcups<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
to start off with the earcups the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.600 
to start off with the earcups the
earcups<00:02:28.940> our<00:02:29.180> firm<00:02:29.780> enough<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:31.250> good<00:02:31.430> for

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
earcups our firm enough to be good for

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430 
earcups our firm enough to be good for
sound<00:02:31.820> isolation<00:02:32.270> but<00:02:32.720> they're<00:02:32.900> not<00:02:33.080> too

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
sound isolation but they're not too

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.960 
sound isolation but they're not too
filmed<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.130> will<00:02:34.280> damage<00:02:34.580> your<00:02:34.610> ears

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
filmed that they will damage your ears

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.120 
filmed that they will damage your ears
now<00:02:35.230> when<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:36.350> talking<00:02:36.680> about<00:02:36.740> sound

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
now when I'm talking about sound

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.400 
now when I'm talking about sound
isolation<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.390> stops<00:02:39.110> sound<00:02:39.680> leakage<00:02:39.920> through

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
isolation it stops sound leakage through

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.070 
isolation it stops sound leakage through
the<00:02:42.410> connection<00:02:42.920> or<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.690> gap<00:02:44.900> between

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
the connection or the the gap between

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.320 
the connection or the the gap between
the<00:02:46.180> cup<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.210> your<00:02:47.780> ear<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:49.070> there<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:50.060> hole

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the cup and your ear but there is a hole

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.270 
the cup and your ear but there is a hole
in<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.600> back<00:02:50.780> here<00:02:51.140> somewhere<00:02:51.980> underneath

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
in the back here somewhere underneath

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.520 
in the back here somewhere underneath
here<00:02:52.640> which<00:02:52.880> they<00:02:53.090> call<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.360> deep<00:02:53.930> bass<00:02:54.230> port

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
here which they call the deep bass port

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.310 
here which they call the deep bass port
now<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.220> will<00:02:55.430> increase<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.780> quality<00:02:57.110> of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
now this will increase the quality of

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.140 
now this will increase the quality of
sound<00:02:57.560> from<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.860> headphones<00:02:58.550> themselves<00:02:58.670> but

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
sound from the headphones themselves but

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.540 
sound from the headphones themselves but
it<00:02:59.270> was<00:02:59.390> also<00:02:59.720> cause<00:03:00.170> sound<00:03:00.770> leakage<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.490> I

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
it was also cause sound leakage so I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.850 
it was also cause sound leakage so I
just<00:03:01.670> wanted<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> point<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.300> out<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:03.440> second

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
just wanted to point that out the second

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.060 
just wanted to point that out the second
thing<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.040> wanted<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.310> talk<00:03:04.550> about<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
thing I wanted to talk about is the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.020 
thing I wanted to talk about is the
connections<00:03:07.600> now<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.840> uses<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.470> why<00:03:10.130> connection

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
connections now it uses a why connection

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.440 
connections now it uses a why connection
from<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.750> cable<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.550> think<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.240> is<00:03:14.420> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
from the cable and I think this is a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.840 
from the cable and I think this is a
good<00:03:14.630> idea<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:15.980> once<00:03:16.460> that<00:03:16.670> have

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
good idea I do like this once that have

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.540 
good idea I do like this once that have
it<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.270> one<00:03:17.540> side<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:18.140> think<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.920> looks<00:03:18.980> lopsided

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
it on one side I think it looks lopsided

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.520 
it on one side I think it looks lopsided
it<00:03:20.510> looks<00:03:20.840> stupid<00:03:21.490> ended<00:03:22.960> overall<00:03:23.960> I<00:03:23.990> think<00:03:24.200> it

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
it looks stupid ended overall I think it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.340 
it looks stupid ended overall I think it
it<00:03:24.920> makes<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.700> headphones<00:03:26.060> work<00:03:26.240> with<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.050> I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
it makes the headphones work with so I

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.800 
it makes the headphones work with so I
do<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:28.010> fact<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.340> they've<00:03:28.580> got<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:29.090> why

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
do like the fact that they've got a why

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.860 
do like the fact that they've got a why
connection<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> headphones<00:03:31.810> now<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
connection to the headphones now the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.170 
connection to the headphones now the
third<00:03:33.290> thing<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.680> want<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:33.860> talk<00:03:34.160> about<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
third thing I want to talk about is the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.740 
third thing I want to talk about is the
sliders<00:03:36.020> here<00:03:36.290> now<00:03:37.040> they<00:03:37.940> are<00:03:38.120> strong<00:03:38.450> they

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
sliders here now they are strong they

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.590 
sliders here now they are strong they
won't<00:03:39.110> snap<00:03:39.730> unless<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.910> being<00:03:41.090> stupid<00:03:41.480> with

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
won't snap unless you being stupid with

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.350 
won't snap unless you being stupid with
them<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.750> actual<00:03:45.250> sort<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.340> sections<00:03:47.000> of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
them but the actual sort of sections of

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.840 
them but the actual sort of sections of
the<00:03:47.480> sliders<00:03:47.740> they're<00:03:48.740> not<00:03:48.890> really<00:03:49.100> definite

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
the sliders they're not really definite

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.310 
the sliders they're not really definite
you<00:03:50.030> don't<00:03:50.240> really<00:03:50.510> know<00:03:50.660> whether<00:03:50.870> you're<00:03:51.170> on

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
you don't really know whether you're on

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.760 
you don't really know whether you're on
one<00:03:51.620> or<00:03:51.770> off<00:03:51.950> one<00:03:52.280> in<00:03:52.520> between<00:03:53.060> one<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.770> I

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
one or off one in between one and I

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.260 
one or off one in between one and I
think<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.370> is<00:03:55.400> something<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.940> could<00:03:56.209> be

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
think that is something that could be

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.430 
think that is something that could be
really<00:03:56.810> really<00:03:57.260> easily<00:03:58.100> improved<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.150> it<00:04:00.140> it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
really really easily improved and it it

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.670 
really really easily improved and it it
might<00:04:00.739> be<00:04:00.950> something<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.730> sort<00:04:01.970> of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
might be something that this sort of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.370 
might be something that this sort of
left<00:04:03.680> left<00:04:04.100> really<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.090> one<00:04:05.270> side<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.750> just

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
left left really to one side and just

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.000 
left left really to one side and just
put<00:04:06.650> standard<00:04:07.160> things<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.670> air<00:04:08.330> but<00:04:09.010> overall

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
put standard things in air but overall

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.910 
put standard things in air but overall
at<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> end<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.640> day<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:12.410> needs<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.830> be

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
at the end of the day it needs to be

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.580 
at the end of the day it needs to be
strong<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.550> strong<00:04:14.200> now<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.260> last

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
strong and it is strong now the last

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.789 
strong and it is strong now the last
thing<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.880> most<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.590> stupid<00:04:18.590> thing

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
thing and really the most a stupid thing

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.159 
thing and really the most a stupid thing
in<00:04:19.010> my<00:04:19.190> idea<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:20.330> design<00:04:20.720> at<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.900> top

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
in my idea is this design at the top

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.570 
in my idea is this design at the top
this<00:04:21.470> headband<00:04:22.460> design<00:04:22.880> why<00:04:23.780> camouflage<00:04:24.580> some

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
this headband design why camouflage some

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.510 
this headband design why camouflage some
people<00:04:25.850> like<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.150> some<00:04:26.419> people<00:04:26.480> don't<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.520> don't

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
people like it some people don't I don't

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.250 
people like it some people don't I don't
like<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.970> personally<00:04:29.450> I<00:04:29.510> think<00:04:29.540> red<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.080> black

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
like it personally I think red and black

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.440 
like it personally I think red and black
headphones<00:04:30.729> you've<00:04:31.729> got<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.030> padding<00:04:32.390> on

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
headphones you've got this padding on

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.070 
headphones you've got this padding on
the<00:04:32.510> top

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
the top

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.749 
the top
shouldn't<00:04:33.830> it<00:04:33.860> still<00:04:34.159> be<00:04:34.310> red<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.490> black

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
shouldn't it still be red and black

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.510 
shouldn't it still be red and black
they've<00:04:35.629> put<00:04:35.990> some<00:04:36.439> camouflage<00:04:36.830> design<00:04:37.189> in

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
they've put some camouflage design in

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.490 
they've put some camouflage design in
which<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.789> don't<00:04:37.939> think<00:04:38.150> goes<00:04:38.330> with<00:04:38.569> the<00:04:38.750> rest

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
which I don't think goes with the rest

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.279 
which I don't think goes with the rest
of<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.770> design<00:04:39.919> of<00:04:40.099> the<00:04:40.220> headphones<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:42.050> in

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
of the design of the headphones it in

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.760 
of the design of the headphones it in
terms<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.830> quality<00:04:42.979> of<00:04:43.550> this<00:04:44.330> pad<00:04:45.319> as<00:04:45.469> well

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
terms of the quality of this pad as well

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.080 
terms of the quality of this pad as well
I<00:04:46.039> think<00:04:47.229> it's<00:04:48.229> good<00:04:48.530> that<00:04:48.949> it's<00:04:49.129> there<00:04:49.400> but

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
I think it's good that it's there but

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.450 
I think it's good that it's there but
it's<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.389> tad<00:04:50.659> too<00:04:51.169> thin<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.800> maybe<00:04:52.099> a<00:04:52.250> bit<00:04:52.430> too

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
it's a tad too thin and maybe a bit too

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.959 
it's a tad too thin and maybe a bit too
thin<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.800> can't<00:04:55.069> you<00:04:55.250> can<00:04:55.490> sort<00:04:55.939> of

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
thin and and you can't you can sort of

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.540 
thin and and you can't you can sort of
feel<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.300> being<00:04:56.719> on<00:04:57.439> your<00:04:57.650> head<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.009> it<00:04:58.129> does

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
feel it being on your head and it does

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.610 
feel it being on your head and it does
put<00:04:58.849> some<00:04:59.060> sort<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.300> pressure<00:04:59.599> on<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.379> top

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
put some sort of pressure on the top

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.040 
put some sort of pressure on the top
making<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.849> slightly<00:05:02.120> uncomfortable<00:05:04.810> so<00:05:05.810> yeah

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
making it slightly uncomfortable so yeah

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.290 
making it slightly uncomfortable so yeah
I<00:05:06.259> think<00:05:06.319> now<00:05:07.129> it's<00:05:07.340> time<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.729> move<00:05:07.849> on<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.150> what

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
I think now it's time to move on to what

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.619 
I think now it's time to move on to what
they<00:05:08.479> actually<00:05:08.629> sound<00:05:08.990> like<00:05:09.199> and<00:05:10.330> how<00:05:11.330> good

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
they actually sound like and how good

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.040 
they actually sound like and how good
they<00:05:11.780> are<00:05:11.960> as<00:05:12.199> headphones<00:05:13.780> okay<00:05:14.780> so<00:05:14.840> after

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
they are as headphones okay so after

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.659 
they are as headphones okay so after
using<00:05:15.349> these<00:05:15.590> headphones<00:05:15.830> I've<00:05:16.190> come<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.550> the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
using these headphones I've come to the

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.270 
using these headphones I've come to the
decision<00:05:16.849> that<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.780> extreme<00:05:18.440> explosive<00:05:19.099> base

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
decision that the extreme explosive base

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.520 
decision that the extreme explosive base
isn't<00:05:19.610> actually<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.360> explosiveness<00:05:21.080> I'd<00:05:21.379> like

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
isn't actually a explosiveness I'd like

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.159 
isn't actually a explosiveness I'd like
it<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.860> make<00:05:22.009> out<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.430> be<00:05:22.580> however<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.659> is<00:05:23.990> still

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
it to make out to be however it is still

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.409 
it to make out to be however it is still
a<00:05:24.710> lot<00:05:25.250> better<00:05:25.430> than<00:05:25.789> one<00:05:25.909> similar<00:05:26.210> post

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
a lot better than one similar post

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.439 
a lot better than one similar post
headphones<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.789> it's<00:05:28.789> good<00:05:29.029> at<00:05:29.150> reproducing

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
headphones and it's good at reproducing

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.589 
headphones and it's good at reproducing
the<00:05:29.960> lower<00:05:30.110> frequencies<00:05:30.800> now<00:05:31.460> with<00:05:32.419> these

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
the lower frequencies now with these

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.879 
the lower frequencies now with these
being<00:05:32.930> all<00:05:33.080> focused<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.740> lower

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
being all focused on the lower

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.559 
being all focused on the lower
frequencies<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.729> base<00:05:34.909> and<00:05:35.150> everything

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
frequencies and the base and everything

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.350 
frequencies and the base and everything
it<00:05:36.020> does<00:05:36.080> seem<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.580> fall<00:05:37.580> behind<00:05:37.759> a<00:05:38.090> bit<00:05:38.270> in

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
it does seem to fall behind a bit in

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.959 
it does seem to fall behind a bit in
terms<00:05:38.509> of<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.870> high<00:05:39.020> frequencies<00:05:39.969> compared

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
to some similar post headphones but it

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.850 
to some similar post headphones but it
is<00:05:43.520> still<00:05:43.759> a<00:05:43.969> lot<00:05:44.330> better<00:05:44.509> than<00:05:44.779> most<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.229> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
is still a lot better than most and the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.119 
is still a lot better than most and the
same<00:05:46.069> with<00:05:46.099> the<00:05:46.550> medium<00:05:47.449> frequencies<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:48.710> is<00:05:49.099> a

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
same with the medium frequencies it is a

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.070 
same with the medium frequencies it is a
lot<00:05:49.490> better<00:05:49.699> than<00:05:50.029> most<00:05:50.509> similar<00:05:50.810> post

headphones<00:05:51.500> but<00:05:52.129> there<00:05:52.490> are<00:05:52.669> some<00:05:53.000> that<00:05:53.389> are

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
headphones but there are some that are

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.010 
headphones but there are some that are
better<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.819> like<00:05:55.819> I<00:05:55.849> said<00:05:56.180> these<00:05:56.479> are<00:05:56.539> all

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
better and like I said these are all

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.269 
better and like I said these are all
focused<00:05:57.289> on<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:58.339> lower<00:05:58.490> frequencies<00:05:59.919> now<00:06:00.919> I

focused on the lower frequencies now I

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.779 
focused on the lower frequencies now I
know<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.909> lot<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.830> on<00:06:03.830> here<00:06:04.370> and<00:06:04.520> over<00:06:04.759> here

the end of this video i will put some
pictures<00:06:15.740> up<00:06:15.919> see<00:06:16.550> how<00:06:16.789> they<00:06:16.969> look<00:06:17.180> on<00:06:17.360> ahead

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
pictures up see how they look on ahead

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.070 
pictures up see how they look on ahead
in<00:06:18.319> terms<00:06:18.560> of<00:06:18.860> how<00:06:19.819> much<00:06:19.969> this<00:06:20.150> dick<00:06:20.389> out<00:06:20.569> and

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
in terms of how much this dick out and

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.619 
in terms of how much this dick out and
what<00:06:21.229> do<00:06:21.319> they<00:06:21.349> look<00:06:21.620> like<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:22.539> because<00:06:23.539> i

know<00:06:23.690> that's<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:24.020> big<00:06:24.050> decision<00:06:24.529> in<00:06:24.860> went<00:06:25.099> by

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279 
know that's a big decision in went by

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:29.740 
know that's a big decision in went by
headphones<00:06:26.589> so<00:06:27.589> those<00:06:27.770> those<00:06:28.419> images<00:06:29.419> will<00:06:29.719> be

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
headphones so those those images will be

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.990
