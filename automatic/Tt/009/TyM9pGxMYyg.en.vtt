alright<00:00:01.709> so<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.250> learning<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> make<00:00:02.970> a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
alright so we're learning how to make a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.340 
alright so we're learning how to make a
Pokeball<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:04.170> cinema<00:00:04.680> 4d<00:00:06.170> we're<00:00:07.170> using

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
Pokeball on cinema 4d we're using

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.339 
Pokeball on cinema 4d we're using
released<00:00:08.280> 11<00:00:08.639> but<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> works<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> same<00:00:10.110> for

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
released 11 but it works the same for

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.810 
released 11 but it works the same for
our<00:00:10.920> 10<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.670> all<00:00:11.759> those<00:00:11.910> other<00:00:12.240> programs

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.350 

so<00:00:16.720> here's<00:00:16.990> all<00:00:17.170> we<00:00:17.289> have<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:18.610> uses<00:00:18.970> a<00:00:19.000> bunch<00:00:19.240> of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
so here's all we have it uses a bunch of

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.830 
so here's all we have it uses a bunch of
techniques<00:00:19.750> that<00:00:20.200> aren't<00:00:20.920> hard<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.660> it's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
techniques that aren't hard but it's

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.640 
techniques that aren't hard but it's
good<00:00:23.199> for<00:00:24.060> learning

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
good for learning

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
good for learning
we're<00:00:27.340> gonna<00:00:27.460> make<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.760> sphere

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680 

keep<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> radius<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> hundred<00:00:32.690> take

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
keep the radius at a hundred take

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
keep the radius at a hundred take
segments<00:00:34.290> come<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.739> 80<00:00:35.540> probably<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.630> with

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
segments come on 80 probably go with

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
segments come on 80 probably go with
less<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.739> needs<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.220> nice<00:00:38.370> round

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
less but it needs just a nice round

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.730 
less but it needs just a nice round
number<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.210> keeps<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.570> clean

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
number that keeps it clean

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.250 
number that keeps it clean
for<00:00:42.310> those<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.610> you<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:42.790> have<00:00:43.120> dropped<00:00:44.110> the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
for those of you that have dropped the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.910 
for those of you that have dropped the
floor<00:00:45.270> push<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.870> drops<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.470> stare<00:00:47.680> into

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
floor push that and drops the stare into

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.640 
floor push that and drops the stare into
the<00:00:48.010> floor<00:00:48.220> for<00:00:48.460> you

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
the floor for you

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.490 
the floor for you
if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.880> it<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.350> recommend<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
if you don't have it I recommend that

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.110 
if you don't have it I recommend that
you<00:00:52.650> get<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.639 

because<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.840> really<00:00:57.020> does<00:00:57.079> take<00:00:57.440> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:57.559> of

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
because it really does take a lot of

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.819 
because it really does take a lot of
time<00:00:57.739> if<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.610> don't<00:00:58.730> have<00:00:59.120> it<00:00:59.680> take<00:01:00.680> your

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
time if you don't have it take your

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.340 
time if you don't have it take your
radius<00:01:01.280> which<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.760> hundred<00:01:02.210> go<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.199> your

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
radius which is a hundred go to your

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.910 
radius which is a hundred go to your
position<00:01:04.269> type<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.540> hundred

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
position type in a hundred

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
position type in a hundred
there<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.299> radius<00:01:09.659> changes<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
there you go the radius changes is to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.690 
there you go the radius changes is to
the<00:01:10.740> same

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
the same

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.910 
the same
and<00:01:13.270> if<00:01:13.390> it's<00:01:13.539> any<00:01:13.689> other<00:01:13.750> shipments<00:01:14.170> fear<00:01:14.619> you

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
and if it's any other shipments fear you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.319 
and if it's any other shipments fear you
have<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.130> do<00:01:15.250> your<00:01:15.340> height<00:01:15.549> I<00:01:15.850> believe<00:01:16.149> thats

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
have to do your height I believe thats

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.490 
have to do your height I believe thats
how<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.570> works<00:01:16.750> for<00:01:16.930> those

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
how it works for those

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
how it works for those

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
this is checked now we're able to see on

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.250 
this is checked now we're able to see on
here<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.500> lovely<00:01:49.500> stuff<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.040> me<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.400> now

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
here a lovely stuff for me to do now

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.240 
here a lovely stuff for me to do now
I'm<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.800> go<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.100> select<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> box

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
I'm going to go in here select a box

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.900 
I'm going to go in here select a box
find<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.400> middle<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.030> relatively<00:01:58.550> for<00:01:59.550> me<00:01:59.730> is

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
find the middle to relatively for me is

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.880 
find the middle to relatively for me is
this<00:02:00.360> one

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.060 

and<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.520> one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and that one

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.070 
and that one
so<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.330> they<00:02:06.540> are

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
so now we know where they are

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.200 
so now we know where they are
easy<00:02:08.920> way<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.130> do<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> good

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
easy way to do it this is a good

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.040 
easy way to do it this is a good
selection

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
selection

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.400 
selection
dhoop<00:02:12.740> selection<00:02:13.630> also<00:02:14.630> works<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.990> see<00:02:15.050> you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
dhoop selection also works you see you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.490 
dhoop selection also works you see you
well

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
well

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.070 
well
so<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.130> decided<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> word<00:02:18.780> was

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
so we decided that one and that word was

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.970 
so we decided that one and that word was
relatively<00:02:19.620> our<00:02:19.860> middle

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
relatively our middle

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.059 
relatively our middle
you've<00:02:22.459> got<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.940> first<00:02:23.870> its<00:02:24.170> name<00:02:24.379> this

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
you've got that first its name this

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.400 
you've got that first its name this
