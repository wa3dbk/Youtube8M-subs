00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and the plaza around them generally

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
and the plaza around them generally
looks<00:01:46.619> good<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.490> look<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> fun<00:01:48.450> ride

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
I don't think this super loop would be a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
I don't think this super loop would be a
bad<00:01:53.040> ride<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.970> park<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.479> fact<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.020> wouldn't

the one thing that Six Flags New England

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.270 
the one thing that Six Flags New England
does<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> dark<00:02:01.290> ride<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.100> is

and so I like to see them add these to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.600 
and so I like to see them add these to
more<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.110> their<00:02:26.260> parks<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.100> could<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.430> them

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
more of their parks and I could see them

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.310 
more of their parks and I could see them
adding<00:02:28.000> one<00:02:28.210> at<00:02:28.330> Six<00:02:28.570> Flags<00:02:28.630> New<00:02:28.930> England<00:02:28.960> at

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
adding one at Six Flags New England at

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.310 
adding one at Six Flags New England at
2017<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.280> 2018<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.480> will<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.750> been<00:02:31.930> five

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
2017 in 2018 it will have been five

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.800 
2017 in 2018 it will have been five
years<00:02:32.350> since<00:02:33.130> six<00:02:33.400> legs<00:02:33.610> New<00:02:33.820> England<00:02:34.150> updated

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
years since six legs New England updated

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.080 
years since six legs New England updated
Hurricane<00:02:35.350> Harbor<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.370> by<00:02:36.550> then<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.910> think

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
Hurricane Harbor and so by then I think

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.460 
Hurricane Harbor and so by then I think
it<00:02:37.210> will<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.420> been<00:02:37.600> about<00:02:37.780> time<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.350> they

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
it will have been about time that they

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.830 
it will have been about time that they
add<00:02:38.650> something<00:02:39.100> new<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.030> could<00:02:40.510> see<00:02:40.690> them

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
add something new to it I could see them

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840 
add something new to it I could see them
adding<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.170> new<00:02:41.290> slide<00:02:41.620> complex<00:02:42.160> but<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.640> can

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
adding a new slide complex but I can

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.420 
adding a new slide complex but I can
also<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.480> them<00:02:43.660> adding<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.200> new<00:02:44.380> family<00:02:44.830> area

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
also see them adding a new family area

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.010 
also see them adding a new family area
parks<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> time<00:02:46.360> will<00:02:46.540> update<00:02:46.690> their

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
parks all the time will update their

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.410 
parks all the time will update their
waterpark<00:02:47.500> by<00:02:47.560> adding<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.280> new<00:02:48.490> Katy<00:02:48.940> splash

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
waterpark by adding a new Katy splash

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
waterpark by adding a new Katy splash
zone<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.990> could<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:50.440> Six<00:02:50.680> Flags<00:02:50.770> New<00:02:51.010> England

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
zone I could see Six Flags New England

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.530 
zone I could see Six Flags New England
also<00:02:51.610> doing<00:02:52.060> that

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
also doing that

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.730 
also doing that
so<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.050> have<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> two<00:02:53.470> main

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
so I think you have the two main

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.890 
so I think you have the two main
possibilities<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.910> last<00:02:55.120> slide<00:02:55.420> complex

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
possibilities the last slide complex

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.930 
possibilities the last slide complex
that<00:02:56.020> they<00:02:56.140> added<00:02:56.290> was<00:02:56.710> thrilled<00:02:57.370> based<00:02:57.640> it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that they added was thrilled based it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.000 
that they added was thrilled based it
was<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> pair<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.630> capsule<00:02:59.350> slides<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.890> was

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
was a pair of capsule slides that was

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.130 
was a pair of capsule slides that was
the<00:03:00.130> bond<00:03:00.280> side<00:03:00.580> pipelines<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.780> might<00:03:01.960> be

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the bond side pipelines so it might be

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.290 
the bond side pipelines so it might be
just<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.560> minor<00:03:02.890> Hurricane<00:03:03.430> Harbor<00:03:03.580> expansion

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
just a minor Hurricane Harbor expansion

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.900 
just a minor Hurricane Harbor expansion
in<00:03:04.530> 29<00:03:05.530> six<00:03:05.980> legs<00:03:06.190> knowing<00:03:06.430> then<00:03:06.580> we'll<00:03:06.760> be

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
in 29 six legs knowing then we'll be

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.360 
in 29 six legs knowing then we'll be
adding<00:03:07.120> their<00:03:07.420> next<00:03:07.840> big<00:03:08.170> roller<00:03:08.530> coaster<00:03:09.100> the

adding their next big roller coaster the

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.340 
adding their next big roller coaster the
one<00:03:09.550> major<00:03:09.910> gap<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.600> their<00:03:10.750> lineup<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.200> that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
one major gap in their lineup is that

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.110 
one major gap in their lineup is that
they<00:03:11.470> don't<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> launch<00:03:12.340> coaster<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.880> Six

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
they don't have a launch coaster and Six

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.090 
they don't have a launch coaster and Six
Flags<00:03:13.240> loves<00:03:13.780> working<00:03:14.110> with<00:03:14.290> premier<00:03:14.830> rides

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Flags loves working with premier rides

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.190 
Flags loves working with premier rides
they've<00:03:15.850> created<00:03:16.210> some<00:03:16.540> great<00:03:16.930> roller

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
they've created some great roller

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.250 
they've created some great roller
coasters<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.820> 2019<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> think<00:03:20.110> they'll

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
coasters and so in 2019 I think they'll

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.010 
coasters and so in 2019 I think they'll
be<00:03:20.410> adding<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.010> launch<00:03:21.760> coaster<00:03:22.180> from<00:03:22.540> premier

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
be adding a launch coaster from premier

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.140 
be adding a launch coaster from premier
rides<00:03:23.230> possibly<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> multi<00:03:24.670> launch<00:03:24.880> coaster

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
rides possibly a multi launch coaster

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.300 
rides possibly a multi launch coaster
now<00:03:25.750> Six<00:03:26.050> Flags<00:03:26.170> New<00:03:26.380> England<00:03:26.500> already<00:03:27.070> has

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
now Six Flags New England already has

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.340 
now Six Flags New England already has
two<00:03:27.640> roller<00:03:27.940> coasters<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.570> go<00:03:28.720> backwards

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
two roller coasters that go backwards

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.340 
two roller coasters that go backwards
Goliath<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.400> flash<00:03:30.760> back<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.600> could<00:03:31.750> see

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
Goliath and flash back so I could see

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.260 
Goliath and flash back so I could see
this<00:03:32.680> new<00:03:32.920> launch<00:03:33.250> coaster<00:03:33.550> not<00:03:33.940> going

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
this new launch coaster not going

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.060 
this new launch coaster not going
backwards<00:03:34.690> however<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.110> lot<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.680> coasters

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
backwards however a lot of the coasters

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.880 
backwards however a lot of the coasters
from<00:03:36.250> premier<00:03:36.640> rides<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:37.810> backwards<00:03:38.320> so

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
from premier rides do go backwards so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.290 
from premier rides do go backwards so
it's<00:03:39.010> possible<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.520> Six<00:03:39.910> Flags<00:03:40.030> New<00:03:40.209> England

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
it's possible that Six Flags New England

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's possible that Six Flags New England
might<00:03:40.780> decide<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> send<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.770> flashback<00:03:42.310> to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
might decide to send a flashback to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.670 
might decide to send a flashback to
another<00:03:42.820> Six<00:03:43.150> Flags<00:03:43.270> Park<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.080> I<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
another Six Flags Park and I think that

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.979 
another Six Flags Park and I think that
is<00:03:44.770> a<00:03:44.800> very<00:03:45.280> likely<00:03:45.610> possibility<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
is a very likely possibility this is the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.170 
is a very likely possibility this is the
6'5<00:03:47.260> spark<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.830> has<00:03:47.950> two<00:03:48.160> boomerangs<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
6'5 spark that has two boomerangs I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.610 
6'5 spark that has two boomerangs I
don't<00:03:49.450> know<00:03:49.540> when<00:03:49.780> they<00:03:49.959> would<00:03:50.170> send<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
don't know when they would send the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.170 
don't know when they would send the
flash<00:03:50.830> back<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.250> another<00:03:51.400> park<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:51.940> think

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
flash back to another park but I think

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.550 
flash back to another park but I think
that<00:03:52.300> that<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.600> very<00:03:52.930> likely<00:03:53.200> possibility

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
that that is a very likely possibility

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.640 
that that is a very likely possibility
for<00:03:54.220> sometime<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.030> next<00:03:55.330> five<00:03:55.570> years

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
for sometime in the next five years

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.750 
for sometime in the next five years
anyways<00:03:56.650> getting<00:03:56.860> back<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.370> premiere

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
anyways getting back to this premiere

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760 
anyways getting back to this premiere
rides<00:03:58.030> coaster<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:58.690> can<00:03:58.989> see<00:03:59.170> them<00:03:59.320> going<00:03:59.620> with

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
rides coaster I can see them going with

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.560 
rides coaster I can see them going with
a<00:03:59.800> clone<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.160> Superman<00:04:00.760> ultimate<00:04:01.239> flight

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
a clone of Superman ultimate flight

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.720 
a clone of Superman ultimate flight
that's<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.260> skyrocket<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:03.100> model<00:04:03.550> it's

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
that's the skyrocket to model it's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.610 
that's the skyrocket to model it's
already<00:04:04.030> been<00:04:04.180> cloned<00:04:04.480> several<00:04:04.900> times<00:04:05.140> or

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
already been cloned several times or

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.470 
already been cloned several times or
they<00:04:05.950> could<00:04:06.100> go<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.340> an<00:04:06.489> original<00:04:06.760> layout

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
they could go with an original layout

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.720 
they could go with an original layout
and<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:07.989> would<00:04:08.170> be<00:04:08.320> just<00:04:08.620> fine<00:04:08.800> too<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.370> think

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
and that would be just fine too I think

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.280 
and that would be just fine too I think
that<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:09.910> can't<00:04:10.180> go<00:04:10.330> wrong<00:04:10.570> with<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.959> coaster

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
that you can't go wrong with the coaster

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.050 
that you can't go wrong with the coaster
from<00:04:11.470> premier<00:04:11.860> rides<00:04:12.100> whether<00:04:12.640> they<00:04:12.850> get<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
from premier rides whether they get a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.300 
from premier rides whether they get a
clone<00:04:13.450> or<00:04:13.480> not<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:14.170> think<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.980> will<00:04:15.160> be<00:04:15.280> a

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
clone or not I think that it will be a

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.030 
clone or not I think that it will be a
great<00:04:15.700> fit<00:04:15.970> for<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.239> park<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:17.080> 2020<00:04:17.769> it's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
great fit for the park and in 2020 it's

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.590 
great fit for the park and in 2020 it's
about<00:04:18.250> time<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.519> they<00:04:18.940> added<00:04:19.299> some<00:04:19.480> new

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
about time that they added some new

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.479 
about time that they added some new
family<00:04:19.900> rides<00:04:20.230> these<00:04:20.739> Larson<00:04:21.220> flying

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
family rides these Larson flying

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.400 
family rides these Larson flying
scooters<00:04:21.970> are<00:04:22.120> pretty<00:04:22.330> popular<00:04:22.630> models<00:04:23.260> I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
scooters are pretty popular models I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.820 
scooters are pretty popular models I
could<00:04:23.530> also<00:04:23.680> see<00:04:23.950> them<00:04:24.100> going<00:04:24.400> with

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
could also see them going with

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.279 
could also see them going with
common<00:04:25.490> family<00:04:25.849> rides<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.810> could<00:04:27.050> go<00:04:27.259> just

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
common family rides this could go just

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.679 
common family rides this could go just
somewhere<00:04:28.129> in<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> park<00:04:28.580> or<00:04:28.849> could<00:04:29.090> go<00:04:29.270> in<00:04:29.539> the

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:29.689 
somewhere in the park or could go in the

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.719 
somewhere in the park or could go in the
kitty<00:04:29.930> section<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.770> park<00:04:31.009> I<00:04:31.220> think<00:04:31.610> that

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
kitty section of the park I think that

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.129 
kitty section of the park I think that
depends<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.240> whether<00:04:32.419> they<00:04:32.599> want<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> go<00:04:32.990> with

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
depends on whether they want to go with

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.070 
depends on whether they want to go with
true<00:04:33.379> family<00:04:33.889> rides<00:04:34.099> or<00:04:34.370> kiddie<00:04:35.120> rides<00:04:35.419> or

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
true family rides or kiddie rides or

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.809 
true family rides or kiddie rides or
they<00:04:36.439> could<00:04:36.620> do<00:04:36.800> both<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.280> then<00:04:37.370> everyone's

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
they could do both and then everyone's

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.260 
they could do both and then everyone's
happy

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
happy

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.089 
happy
so<00:04:38.569> just<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.960> recap<00:04:39.110> here's<00:04:39.560> what<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.979> am

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
so just to recap here's what I am

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.649 
so just to recap here's what I am
predicting<00:04:40.490> for<00:04:40.939> Six<00:04:41.180> Flags<00:04:41.270> New<00:04:41.509> England

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
predicting for Six Flags New England

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.409 
predicting for Six Flags New England
within<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.770> next<00:04:42.949> five<00:04:43.250> years<00:04:43.639> again<00:04:44.240> these

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
within the next five years again these

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.779 
within the next five years again these
are<00:04:44.599> just<00:04:44.629> predictions<00:04:45.590> none<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:46.550> is

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
are just predictions none of this is

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.909 
are just predictions none of this is
confirmed<00:04:47.449> however<00:04:48.199> this<00:04:48.319> is<00:04:48.469> just<00:04:48.710> what<00:04:48.889> I

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
confirmed however this is just what I

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.649 
confirmed however this is just what I
would<00:04:49.280> like<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.610> see<00:04:49.789> at<00:04:49.879> the<00:04:50.030> park<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:50.449> what<00:04:50.629> I

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
would like to see at the park and what I

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.600 
would like to see at the park and what I
think<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.319> likely<00:04:51.650> I've<00:04:52.189> made<00:04:52.430> these

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
think is likely I've made these

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.670 
think is likely I've made these
predictions<00:04:53.030> based<00:04:53.419> off<00:04:53.629> of<00:04:53.659> trends<00:04:54.409> in<00:04:54.560> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
predictions based off of trends in the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.770 
predictions based off of trends in the
industry<00:04:54.879> however<00:04:55.879> five<00:04:56.120> years<00:04:56.449> is<00:04:56.659> a<00:04:56.689> long

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
industry however five years is a long

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.450 
industry however five years is a long
time<00:04:57.319> it's<00:04:57.500> very<00:04:57.710> possible<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.250> new

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
time it's very possible the new

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.070 
time it's very possible the new
manufacturer<00:04:59.090> could<00:04:59.270> come<00:04:59.479> out<00:04:59.659> with<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.810> new

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
manufacturer could come out with a new

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.290 
manufacturer could come out with a new
ride<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.620> then<00:05:00.949> six<00:05:01.219> vials<00:05:01.550> could<00:05:01.789> surprise

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
ride and then six vials could surprise

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.950 
ride and then six vials could surprise
everyone

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
everyone

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.260 
everyone
and<00:05:03.169> install<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:04.069> new<00:05:04.340> ride<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.909> all<00:05:05.090> of

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
and install that new ride at all of

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.360 
and install that new ride at all of
their<00:05:05.419> parks<00:05:05.750> look<00:05:06.199> at<00:05:06.349> last<00:05:06.590> year<00:05:06.889> no<00:05:07.099> one<00:05:07.129> was

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
their parks look at last year no one was

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.070 
their parks look at last year no one was
expecting<00:05:07.520> six<00:05:08.120> Ike's<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.509> install<00:05:08.780> four

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
expecting six Ike's to install four

expecting six Ike's to install four
super<00:05:09.590> loops<00:05:09.770> at<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.099> park<00:05:10.310> that<00:05:10.699> was

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
super loops at the park that was

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.670 
super loops at the park that was
completely<00:05:11.240> out<00:05:11.389> of<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.810> blue<00:05:11.930> yet<00:05:12.289> they<00:05:12.440> did

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
completely out of the blue yet they did

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.700 
completely out of the blue yet they did
it<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.009> these<00:05:13.430> predictions<00:05:13.789> are<00:05:14.090> made<00:05:14.150> from

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
it so these predictions are made from

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.010 
it so these predictions are made from
2015<00:05:15.710> based<00:05:16.310> off<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.580> what<00:05:17.060> we've<00:05:17.240> seen<00:05:17.629> and
