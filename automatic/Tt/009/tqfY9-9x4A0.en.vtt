of the third one out of print and i was

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
of the third one out of print and i was
worried<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.430> wanted<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
worried that if i wanted to get the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.550 
worried that if i wanted to get the
third<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.240> later<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.960> wouldn't<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.290> able<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
third one later I wouldn't be able to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.140 
third one later I wouldn't be able to
get<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> hardback<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> wouldn't

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
get in a hardback and then it wouldn't

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.380 
get in a hardback and then it wouldn't
match<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.130> I've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> American<00:01:27.210> edition

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
match so I've got the American edition

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
match so I've got the American edition
because<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.170> UK<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> isn't<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.100> hardback<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
because the UK one isn't in hardback it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
because the UK one isn't in hardback it
seems<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> only<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.420> paperback<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
seems to only be a paperback so this is
