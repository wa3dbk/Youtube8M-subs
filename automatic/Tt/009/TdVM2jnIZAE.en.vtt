school closed in to develop that the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.750 
school closed in to develop that the
infrastructure<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.019> school<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.949> grown

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
infrastructure of the school was grown

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
infrastructure of the school was grown
organically<00:01:03.659> and<00:01:04.460> as<00:01:05.460> such<00:01:06.409> wasn't<00:01:07.409> linked

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
organically and as such wasn't linked

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.559 
organically and as such wasn't linked
together<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.720> main<00:01:09.720> initial<00:01:10.470> project<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569 
together so main initial project was to

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.669 
together so main initial project was to
get<00:01:13.220> servers<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.429> hardware<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.179> cope

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
get servers and hardware in the cope

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:22.580 
get servers and hardware in the cope
with<00:01:17.149> proper<00:01:18.149> network

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 

so<00:01:23.159> service<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.939> chose<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.360> currently<00:01:25.170> run<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so service we chose we currently run a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.580 
so service we chose we currently run a
virtualized<00:01:26.329> server<00:01:27.329> back-end<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.439> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
virtualized server back-end which is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.330 
virtualized server back-end which is
based<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.009> VMware<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.509> looking<00:01:30.659> at

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
based on VMware and we are looking at

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
based on VMware and we are looking at
the<00:01:32.340> acquisition<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.149> r7<00:01:33.810> tends<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.350> help

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the acquisition of the r7 tends to help

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.639 
the acquisition of the r7 tends to help
us<00:01:34.710> implement<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.460> full<00:01:36.320> virtual<00:01:37.320> desktop

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
us implement a full virtual desktop

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.370 
us implement a full virtual desktop
environment<00:01:38.539> throughout<00:01:39.539> certain<00:01:40.049> areas<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
environment throughout certain areas of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.200 
environment throughout certain areas of
the<00:01:40.590> school<00:01:40.799> along<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> Dell<00:01:41.729> servers

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the school along with the Dell servers

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.490 
the school along with the Dell servers
we<00:01:42.420> chose<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> Intel<00:01:43.590> Xeon<00:01:43.619> e5<00:01:44.549> 645

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
we chose the Intel Xeon e5 645

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.090 
we chose the Intel Xeon e5 645
processors<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:47.070> gave<00:01:47.310> us<00:01:47.340> multiple<00:01:47.880> core

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
processors which gave us multiple core

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.200 
processors which gave us multiple core
infrastructure<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:50.970> deploy

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
infrastructure so that we could deploy

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
infrastructure so that we could deploy
many<00:01:51.539> many<00:01:51.780> tasks<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.950> are<00:01:53.130> ideally<00:01:53.610> suited

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
many many tasks and are ideally suited

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.529 
many many tasks and are ideally suited
to<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.799> virtual<00:01:55.799> environment<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> benefits

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
to a virtual environment so the benefits

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.899 
to a virtual environment so the benefits
that<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.470> envisage<00:01:58.679> from<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.459> are<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that we envisage from that are the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.149 
that we envisage from that are the
certainly<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> energy<00:02:01.110> cost<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.039> will

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
certainly the energy cost that we will

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.539 
certainly the energy cost that we will
save<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.630> centralized<00:02:04.200> management<00:02:04.549> of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
save it's the centralized management of

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
save it's the centralized management of
the<00:02:05.759> desktops<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:06.420> deployment<00:02:06.990> giving<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the desktops and deployment giving that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.630 
the desktops and deployment giving that
continuity<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.539> users<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.549> members<00:02:11.549> of

robust system in place it really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.580 
robust system in place it really
empowers<00:02:49.910> what<00:02:50.660> teachers<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.200> schools<00:02:51.410> can

course is that we have half-day support
each<00:03:54.180> week<00:03:54.540> where<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.379> an<00:03:55.500> engineering

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
each week where we get an engineering
