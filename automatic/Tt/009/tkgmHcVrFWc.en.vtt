00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
after I did it on stage and kind of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
after I did it on stage and kind of
wanted<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> closer<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.420> thought<00:00:33.870> I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
wanted to see it closer so I thought I

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.330 
wanted to see it closer so I thought I
would<00:00:34.020> film<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.530> put<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.010> because

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
would film it and put it on here because

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
would film it and put it on here because
I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.149> quite<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.480> easy<00:00:36.660> style<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.620> not

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I think it's quite an easy style and not

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440 
I think it's quite an easy style and not
one<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> people<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.820> probably

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one that people think they can probably

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450

do<00:00:39.600> themselves<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:40.980> try<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.340> show
