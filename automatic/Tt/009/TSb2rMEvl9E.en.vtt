and<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.969> apply<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> modes

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
and that is how do you apply the modes

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.799 
and that is how do you apply the modes
and<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.679> other<00:00:13.860> modes<00:00:14.190> very<00:00:14.460> briefly<00:00:14.880> modes

lesson I'm going to stick to one of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
lesson I'm going to stick to one of the
modes<00:00:43.800> each<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> name<00:00:44.700> by<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> way<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
modes each one is a name by the way the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
modes each one is a name by the way the
sixth<00:00:45.629> degree<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> called<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> Aeolian<00:00:46.980> mode

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sixth degree is called the Aeolian mode

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.209 
sixth degree is called the Aeolian mode
um<00:00:48.020> people<00:00:49.020> how<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> play<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> modes

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
um people how do you play the a modes

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
um people how do you play the a modes
how<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.640> apply<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:51.510> once<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> know

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
how do you apply them well once you know

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the major scale the parent scale if you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
the major scale the parent scale if you
can<00:00:55.079> play<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> neck<00:00:56.550> in

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
can play that up and down the neck in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
can play that up and down the neck in
all<00:00:57.030> different<00:00:57.239> positions<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.140> different

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
fifth position it's built around it like

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.140 
fifth position it's built around it like

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
sort of D minor chord but it's built

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.450 
sort of D minor chord but it's built
around<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:29.780> F<00:02:30.020> which<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.500> basically<00:02:31.010> ranked

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
around this F which is basically ranked

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.210 
around this F which is basically ranked
around<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.820> C<00:02:32.090> C<00:02:33.050> chord<00:02:33.380> form<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.950> move

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
around the C C chord form and I move

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.340 
around the C C chord form and I move
that<00:02:34.250> up<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.240> way<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.750> rout<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.200> on

I<00:02:49.370> hope<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.700> really<00:02:49.880> really<00:02:50.690> play<00:02:50.960> fit<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.910> I

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
I hope you really really play fit and I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.910 
I hope you really really play fit and I
take<00:02:59.270> two<00:02:59.450> strings<00:02:59.780> at<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.020> time<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.470> bouncing

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
take two strings at a time and bouncing

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.740 
take two strings at a time and bouncing
back<00:03:01.100> from<00:03:01.250> one<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.610> another<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:02.090> just<00:03:02.420> using

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
back from one to another and just using

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.600 
back from one to another and just using
the<00:03:02.870> upscale<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.560> I'm<00:03:03.950> thinking<00:03:04.220> about<00:03:04.490> this

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
the upscale and I'm thinking about this

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:24.980 
the upscale and I'm thinking about this
progression

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.980 

you

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.750 

always<00:03:30.500> come<00:03:30.650> back<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:30.980> major<00:03:31.340> scale

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
always come back to that major scale

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.060 
always come back to that major scale
that<00:03:32.060> major<00:03:32.360> sounding<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:33.500> I'm<00:03:33.650> starting

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
that major sounding but I'm starting

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.490 
that major sounding but I'm starting
from<00:03:34.400> D<00:03:34.610> minor<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.270> basically<00:03:35.840> all<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.320> modes

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
from D minor and basically all the modes

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.740 
from D minor and basically all the modes
are<00:03:36.770> like<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.790> if<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.060> contact<00:03:38.600> me
