00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.720
 There are many ways to export their suitability projects to me 

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.769
 I'll show him an example for everyone 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.159
 and start outputting images 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.070
 we would like to export a day image to complete a flyer 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.910
 in the scene is an actor in a certain pose of 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.900
 I would now like to export a picture of this actor in the preview window 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 where the background should not be output 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.150
 therefore, I disable under 2 10 the reason the background 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.450
 Now we are ready for the issue 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.290
 we also connect and export Velen picture 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.819
 and the format HK 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.279
 then we change the settings for the color depth to 32 under extended 

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:55.040
 bit 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.480
 Next, either a standard resolution for our image 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 select or set a custom size 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.730
 insulted 800 times 600 for this workshop 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.200
 Next, with the edges make quality 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.390
 I have smooth edges enabled 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 making the edges of an avatar 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.130
 not shown as covers give now we are done and kick on 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.140
 six games 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.180
 later can use Photoshop 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.040
 and to select the Alfa channel of the inclined created image and so on 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 place in another picture 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.280
 let us export the entire video 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.430
 the correct ones so on video now we can resume the output size 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.090
 determine 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.780
 we have the option of many different formats including 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.330
 has to choose 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.910
 adjust the thickest aspect ratio if you know that the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.610
 Presentation should be done on the TV and it's aspect ratio 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.819
 know 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.900
 Under margins quality we again turn on the edges smoothing for one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.569
 qualitatively better result then to the output area Public define 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.169
 can 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.489
 which area of ​​the video we would like to spend, for example, with the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.609
 to need the first 500 cases 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.369
 we can adjust this here 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:30.499
 Note that soil markers in the player ice tea through the change 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.789
 that issue has changed the position 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.829
 I would like to export the entire video though 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.890
 and undo the changes 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.900
 Next we can set the refresh rate 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.120
 15 at the moment 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.529
 one second missing 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.659
 They can do this higher or lower according to their needs 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.209
 to adjust 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.569
 then press export because a codec 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 we call the output and margins of the movie 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.799
 another common output format is maybe and that we are in this format 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.419
 To render, go back to Format 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.889
 because they flash video and they go to extended 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.980
 Here you can see the quality settings for video and audio 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.770
 You can also specify a html page according to your needs 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.329
 so that we can watch the video later on a web page 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.329
 the remaining settings are those when exporting a hd-video 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.459
 we go as well as export 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.879
 if you export flash videos with html-pages it makes sense to use one 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.879
 create your own folder for the output files 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:49.409
 Now we can open our html page and watch the Flash movie 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.640
 You can also export image sequences 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.210
 which can be used, for example, in PowerPoint presentations 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.630
 Just go to image sequence and if you're taking format of one 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.630
 Action 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.919
 we do not want to spend the background so we went to stage since 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.709
 the background and the activate the background 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.729
 then choose the desired output larger and the range just like us 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.570
 have it done at the movie then just press and export 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.979
 Save the animation in a folder you want for your animations 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.539
 have prepared 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.210
 later we can open a powerpoint presentation and the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.949
 animation goes past our presentation a bit 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.169
 spice 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.949
 Next, export like TweetDeck people for the appreciation of 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.029
 Videos can be used 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.609
 Just go to picture segment and if it shines under format Takashi 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.190
 then select the desired output larger and the output range 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.639
 just as we did with the movie the difference is 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.460
 that now many images are rendered in order to frame the animation 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.189
 read out for frame 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.619
 Just press export and save everything in one for your 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.819
 Takers sequence prepared folders in a movie editing program can 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.220
 we later insert our takers sequence 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.220
 to upgrade under the door 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.750
 the vip-tent edition was for "Wickie" to me 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.490
 or offers Kaarst developed 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.320
 and create animated avatars that enhance the design of DIGITUS® 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.849
 The output provided is quite similar to the export of other videos 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.659
 that they continue to set output largest range inseparable quality 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:42.569
 the difference may be additional setting options 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.569
 for video and audio quality 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.730
 They also go export and they can use their animated avatar 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.349
 use intel-chip cast 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.360
 Find out about witty Kaarst to learn 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 what they can accomplish with widget cast and a clone 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.309
 this prevented the basics of outputting and margining one's own four
