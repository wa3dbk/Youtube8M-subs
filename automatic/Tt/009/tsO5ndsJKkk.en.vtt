a<00:02:57.950> left<00:02:58.160> edge<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.550> their<00:02:58.640> course<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.000> want<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
a left edge and their course you want to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.520 
a left edge and their course you want to
double<00:03:01.330> pressure<00:03:02.330> line<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> left<00:03:03.080> real

to get a little more risky with the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.310 
to get a little more risky with the
coverage<00:03:16.390> take<00:03:17.390> some<00:03:17.570> more<00:03:17.690> chances<00:03:18.110> and
