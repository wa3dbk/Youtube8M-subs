00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 many of you asked to remove nine here 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.130
 I'll take you nine immediately start 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 engine because unlike 14 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
 there are more different engines here 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.580
 used here we are worth 1 and 5 8 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.609
 valve does not pay or may on this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.539
 the cover from these 6 also costs 15 mice 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.160
 2005 so there were still others 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.490
 the engine here is our injection 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 activity bedbugs which gives out 78 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.110
 The longest force of the plant is the most powerful 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 the engine that was installed here 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.399
 exactly the factory in general in the nineties there in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 the end of 80 thousand leave the engines 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:50.160
 11 with a capacity of just under 60 horses 134 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.550
 horses and here it is the day and 5 were still 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.309
 versions with a carburetor there was something 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 about 72 horsepower here injector 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.539
 It costs 15 problems of these engines often 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.600
 have to adjust valve this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.869
 about well addicted as you drive 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 of course if you would be naughty 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 for every 5 thousand you have them 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.689
 adjust so if you are ok 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 you can ride up to twenty to thirty 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.900
 thousand kilometers find there che resources 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.650
 engine from the factory as the factory we are told 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 somewhere 120-130 thousand in fact they 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.979
 driving through 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.220
 and two hundred or three hundred thousand depending on how you drive 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:42.210
 of course change into brushes and here 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 the wires like it just hang out and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.909
 Here begins to get loose and just 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.200
 contact here is a bad crappy build 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.330
 contact: the contact is not present and there is a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.850
 what you have 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.580
 someone troit the engine you don't know in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.770
 what's the reason and it's usually this 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.980
 there is still such a minus is that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.740
 often antifreeze leaves you may due 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.200
 This cap antifreeze cap can 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.650
 just at least evaporate 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.450
 can from pipes which are already or from 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.710
 300 miles old or cold 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.100
 enter such problems in general nine itself 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.110
 by her nineties she was considered 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.080
 cool car 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:41.520
 Yes, and now many kid or 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:44.310
 what do nine times skate 14 than 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.970
 it differs in which one is better and there 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 plus minus 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.030
 nine is more expensive let's say take 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.970
 nine 4 years 14 4 years 14 husband stands 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.170
 120 30000 for a good 14 4 years nine 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 will cost as in a cafe can for 140 per 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.950
 150 pieces can be put for 160 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.830
 200 and insert them buy and why them 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.350
 buy soles nine by itself 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.920
 it is considered more reliable cars and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.620
 strong 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.580
 at the expense of these bumpers here 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.500
 to the bright of these bankers there aluminum 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.590
 spacer but it still does not 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.019
 option to see it there is due 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:34.890
 this machine is stronger and the body itself 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:38.550
 yourself a little harder than 14 to another 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.670
 here the problem is these machines that gave it 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.850
 hood open hood can not open 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.850
 open the hood 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.250
 I'll show myself a cheat on a search for a cable from 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.060
 hood 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.379
 here it is 2 frequency that just pops up 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.760
 here you can not see from here 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.360
 often happens to that pops up 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.810
 how then to subdue the whole service 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.220
 do not shoot this number yourself 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.230
 protection bald head do you have this protection 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.229
 put your hand between the radiator and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.320
 engine but see that the engine was not 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:23.570
 hot this all can be thrust 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.669
 arm here somewhere in the area by 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.470
 click open you hood this 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:34.310
 put back and there are no problems 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.860
 some on the body what is it here now 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.260
 concerns those cities 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.290
 I'm on the road that the secret starts cars 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.080
 rust without it on rust mi-6 and 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.300
 not treated neglected elephants like 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.639
 rust appears even here like 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.940
 Lockers are here and it starts 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.270
 rust is going to gather like this often 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.700
 here it is a disease they have such 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.789
 the reason here is specially processed 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.840
 you start here all the rust thread then 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:13.680
 everything here is also the very back here 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.240
 starts to rust rot too here 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:23.190
 on the wings the boot lid begins 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.350
 here , after all, many have probably seen that 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.350
 that the laundry is all there 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.919
 but all the engines allan said something 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.740
 I also cut salons here too 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.680
 It also depends on the year 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.809
 two thousand years 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.710
 salons here put here like here 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:47.719
 europanel 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:51.449
 still high panel was even been here 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:55.259
 when they sold their salon prices such 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.809
 were for example well here with high 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.539
 panel to cost about six thousand 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:03.210
 dollars this is an example I say 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:07.889
 1 euro panel she already dollars on 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.710
 two hundred three hundred was more expensive but this one 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.949
 the panel itself is seeded like a but 14 but 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.219
 so then the boss started 1 109 will become 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:21.659
 nine get up were still a low panel 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:24.539
 it was in the 90s they put it in the 90s 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:28.110
 years with engines 1st day or 1 and 3 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:31.889
 Basically there were 1 and 5 modifications then the garden 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.969
 and low power balakovo tachometer and in 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.689
 recorded as is without tachometer 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:40.259
 what else can 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:44.399
 the old nine differed from more 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:47.370
 fresh on old nines it and 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:50.270
 certainly new nine 2005 old 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.669
 Nine wing was short counted 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.189
 it ended so here was 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:02.370
 the hood was cut too 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:05.819
 carved by these differed she so 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.639
 nine by itself is not particularly distinguished 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:14.370
 has not changed that is for all these times 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:16.379
 and 14 became the same with the principle in general 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.370
 then all of the nine you liked 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:24.680
 review put likes subscribe will 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.680
 many more videos to enter
