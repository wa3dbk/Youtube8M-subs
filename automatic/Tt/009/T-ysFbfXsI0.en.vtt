00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.450
 and we're back an adrenaline of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.040
 excélsior television and of course that 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.230
 We will bring all the information of the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.820
 international football but before 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.020
 enter this information a greeting to 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.300
 my colleagues because we were here 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.090
 with you half an hour ago we are going to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 enter what is the image of the day that 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.099
 it seemed to me until the mica because 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.439
 talking about this that is the month and 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.260
 lions messi reaching raul like 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.320
 football 's top scorer Spain 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 because it came to overshadow in a certain way what 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.629
 it was the value the gold booty that won 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.219
 Christian ronaldo if I just think 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.350
 Christian wants to get rid of month and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.910
 sportingly speaking and always what 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.429
 has in good action is that really 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.019
 Christian Ronaldo let go his chance 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.719
 before liverpool thanks to the great 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.230
 performance that the mignolet goalkeeper had 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.940
 that cut him like 5 and definitely 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.010
 good Christian because he could not get to 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.770
 this brand messi did not want to lose the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.870
 opportunity and obviously this 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.630
 situation that is given is going to put very 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.880
 interesting the issues that are going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.290
 give around the golden ball 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.869
 that the fifa awards because immediately 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.380
 came the reactions the 'tata' 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.659
 martino 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.360
 saying that he replies month and will continue 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.539
 breaking records and that for him the only 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.909
 winner of that award because it is the flea 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.200
 and on the other hand carlo ancelotti the same 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.259
 day declares that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 Christian ronaldo could only have 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.430
 German player competition 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.210
 canceling messi completely for not 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.920
 put it in Argentina that's the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 carlo ancelotti's position of his 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.950
 technical but how many times 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.259
 they wanted to roll he faced the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.780
 situation of seeing lionel messi winning 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.579
 the golden ball to the best player in 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.439
 europe and he stayed with his hands 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.929
 empty and now that he gets the booty of 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.810
 gold something messi does for performances are 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.520
 happened on the subject of scoring doublet 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.649
 Christian and the other for the other day 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.170
 Christian tico double was made 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.120
 triplet hat-trick and repeated lionel 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.209
 messi now the golden boot is given by 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.329

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.459

 goals in the pair of goals scored 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.269
 against Ajax team in the league 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.819
 Champions of Europe have already tied 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.940
 to raul this is already the images where 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.720
 Christian because he shared his boot a little 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.060
 of gold 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.040
 in the Real Madrid squad - points 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.930

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.329
 by the genoa c raúl and Christian for the 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.730

 Messi already made 71 in champions raul to the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.299
 27 years old was 48 and Christian at 27 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.930
 years 44 resists the situation of the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.049
 love to peel but he did not stop recognizing 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.810
 that Christian ronaldo seems to me today 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.560
 today the most complete athlete who participated 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.319
