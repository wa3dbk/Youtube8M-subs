trimmer head output so if you look on
your<00:00:21.470> trimmers<00:00:22.470> engines<00:00:22.859> nobody<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> can

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
your trimmers engines nobody you can

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.870 
your trimmers engines nobody you can
find<00:00:24.470> some<00:00:25.470> details<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:26.189> I've<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.789> the

bottle this water bottle is a five

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.600 
bottle this water bottle is a five
hundred<00:01:02.910> mils<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
hundred mils and just get the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
hundred mils and just get the
measurement<00:01:06.119> cups<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.680> particular

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
measurement cups and for this particular

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.609 
measurement cups and for this particular
one<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.090> 50<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:10.380> we'll<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
one if it's at 50 to one how we'll be

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.899 
one if it's at 50 to one how we'll be
using<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.100> 10<00:01:11.400> mils<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> oil<00:01:12.180> against<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
using a 10 mils of the oil against the

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.320 
using a 10 mils of the oil against the
500<00:01:14.909> metres<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> pickles

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
500 metres of pickles

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.590 
500 metres of pickles
so<00:01:18.330> our<00:01:18.450> fish<00:01:18.630> oil<00:01:18.960> off<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:20.090> surfer<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
so our fish oil off got here surfer to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.550 
so our fish oil off got here surfer to
two-stroke<00:01:22.409> engines<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.900> mission<00:01:25.439> up

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
two-stroke engines so we just mission up

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.779 
two-stroke engines so we just mission up
10<00:01:26.400> mils

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.490 

so<00:01:36.789> so<00:01:37.630> that's<00:01:37.780> ten<00:01:38.109> minutes<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.469> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
so so that's ten minutes in the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:58.349 
so so that's ten minutes in the
measurement<00:01:38.950> cups<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.909> we'll<00:01:58.060> mix<00:01:58.179> some

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
measurement cups now we'll mix some

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:06.929 
measurement cups now we'll mix some
petrol<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.780> so<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:02.020> one<00:02:05.489> we'll<00:02:06.489> just<00:02:06.700> pour

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
petrol in so this one we'll just pour

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:16.440 
petrol in so this one we'll just pour
some<00:02:07.049> petrol<00:02:08.049> a<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.709> that's<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.280> cookie<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
some petrol a so that's the cookie to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:03:12.490 
some petrol a so that's the cookie to
one<00:02:16.599> mix

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.730 

that's<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:14.040> suck<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.590> give<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.680> a

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
that's it just suck it up and give it a

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.640 
that's it just suck it up and give it a
few<00:03:16.890> shakes<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.600> that's<00:03:21.960> how<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.410> mix

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
few shakes so that's how you can mix

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.150 
few shakes so that's how you can mix
your<00:03:23.840> petrol<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:24.990> oil<00:03:25.080> together<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:26.010> your

your petrol and oil together for your

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.280 
your petrol and oil together for your
two-stroke<00:03:26.700> engines<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.870> why<00:03:27.990> should<00:03:28.200> go

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
two-stroke engines and why should go

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.200 
two-stroke engines and why should go
down<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.920> pull<00:03:29.160> into<00:03:29.310> your<00:03:29.700> engines

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
down you can just pull into your engines

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.680 
down you can just pull into your engines
over<00:03:30.420> here<00:03:30.980> so<00:03:31.980> simply<00:03:32.460> just<00:03:32.490> open<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.360> tap

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
over here so simply just open the tap

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.840 
over here so simply just open the tap
here<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.350> we<00:03:34.950> feel<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.310> petrol<00:03:35.640> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
here and just we feel the petrol and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.040 
here and just we feel the petrol and
that's<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.410> thanks<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:37.440> watching<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.830> video
