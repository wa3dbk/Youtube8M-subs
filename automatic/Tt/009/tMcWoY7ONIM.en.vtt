00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.709
 kombÃ¼se today make greek Satzky 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.680
 for this we take greek yogurt 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.970
 that has about ten percent fat and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.840
 it is therefore much stronger than yogurt 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.400
 we otherwise used here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 I 'm doing a big helping today 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.140
 cheer we now have a cucumber and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.810
 rub those on the coarse side of 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.739
 under 4 channel that is relatively fast 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.050
 and then find that everything is regulated 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.829
 this must be seasoned with salt 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.329
 the water from the cucumber streets 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.210
 is pulled out so that afterwards the young 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.610
 not too much improved that sounds like me 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.920
 a bit by that I'm good at salt 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.100
 then mixed it all goes a bit 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.130
 faster but you learn already at 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.619
 work as much water as comes out 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:12.280
 what do we want so small 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:16.619
 we do not have to cut the bouquet 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 to fall is cut small 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 then we need another lemon 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.750
 So the juice of a whole lemon 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.730
 is completely enough for the two kilos 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.670
 season yoghurt 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.410
 so now we have the till we had 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.830
 that he is no longer interested 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:53.700
 cook then squeezes the squeeze 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:01.020
 properly squeeze lemon out 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:05.010
 stuck and squeezing from the press always 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 continue and still the last 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.830
 then the whole thing is mixed with pepper 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 we take again mix 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.420
 only then does it happen that way 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.910
 Now our groups are taking the stripes 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.160
 leaving you have the water with it 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.370
 a bit out, we push that 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.630
 still strong from that too 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.840
 much of the water really 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.550
 disappeared then it comes up with 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.680
 the yogurt and then the fun begins 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.780
 because now maybe we can 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.280
 slip 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.910
 he is always real for little boys 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.910
 a great thing 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.620
 in the middle funny sounds 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 if we mix everything well now 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.660
 Of course one of the days missed 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.700
 most important things namely garlic 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.970
 I have this again on this 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.950
 fantastic trip pretty fine there 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.640
 A courier comes out and it will 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.640
 mixed times 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.180
 Now we have to do it all over again 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.829
 always season in between times 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.439
 try and then you immediately notice something 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.769
 is missing a bit salt and 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.769
 pepper 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.130
 so we mixed that up and now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.560
 there is still a flavor carrier and that 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:13.630
 then a lot of olive oil when we on 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.620
 best greek tiki and that work 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.720
 Let's go again 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.010
 it looks like this is going to happen 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.510
 not connect but that irritates completely 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.320
 well, have a bit of patience and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.320
 then it works already 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:38.110
 The confused once tasted goes 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.360
 not that it was done i wish you 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.939
 a good appetite and have a look also 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.400
 the other videos and if you still 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.819
 have wishes except you just in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.819
