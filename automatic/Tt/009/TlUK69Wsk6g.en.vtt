all<00:00:00.210> right<00:00:00.329> guys<00:00:11.660> we<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:42.440> getting<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> note

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
all right guys we have getting a note

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.990 
all right guys we have getting a note
here<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:43.950> off-camera<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> technically

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
here from off-camera that technically

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
here from off-camera that technically
we're<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.149> supposed<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.620> compare<00:00:46.620> human

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we're not supposed to compare human

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.410 
we're not supposed to compare human
brains<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> computers<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> not

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
brains and computers like it's not

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.940 
brains and computers like it's not
something<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.079> technically<00:00:49.649> do

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
something that you can technically do

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.319 
something that you can technically do
which<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.850> disappointing

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
which is a little disappointing

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
which is a little disappointing
considering<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:51.989> time<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.829> spent<00:00:53.100> on

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
considering how much time we spent on

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.520 
considering how much time we spent on
that<00:00:53.370> intro<00:00:53.760> okay<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that intro okay so we can we can kind of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
that intro okay so we can we can kind of
compare<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.219> outputs<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.239> brains<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
compare the outputs of brains and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
compare the outputs of brains and
computers<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.590> let's<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
computers so let's at least do that the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
computers so let's at least do that the
world's<00:01:00.120> largest<00:01:00.239> supercomputer<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> called

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
world's largest supercomputer is called

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.570 
world's largest supercomputer is called
Kay<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:03.030> lives<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> Japan<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.400> mean<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
Kay and it lives in Japan I mean if it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
Kay and it lives in Japan I mean if it
was<00:01:05.670> an<00:01:05.760> America<00:01:06.240> we'd<00:01:06.390> call<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.630> something

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
was an America we'd call it something

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.539 
was an America we'd call it something
much<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.470> epic<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.490> were

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
much more epic than that but they were

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
much more epic than that but they were
like<00:01:08.820> let's<00:01:09.030> pick<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> letter<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.290> that'll<00:01:10.799> be

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
like let's pick a letter and that'll be

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
like let's pick a letter and that'll be
it<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.369> computes<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:11.850> four<00:01:12.090> times<00:01:12.330> faster

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it it computes about four times faster

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
it it computes about four times faster
than<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.170> brain<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.590> has<00:01:13.740> about<00:01:13.979> 10<00:01:14.490> times

process the equivalent of about 2.2 mega
flops<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.610> love<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.909> word<00:01:21.060> mega<00:01:21.299> flop<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
flops I love that word mega flop it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
flops I love that word mega flop it
sounds<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> my<00:01:22.560> cat<00:01:22.770> does<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:23.280> she

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
sounds like what my cat does when she

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
sounds like what my cat does when she
wants<00:01:23.670> me<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> rub<00:01:23.970> her<00:01:24.060> belly<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.390> mega<00:01:24.630> flop<00:01:24.900> is

a million operations per second so our

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
a million operations per second so our

I mean when you see the stupidity of
some<00:01:36.960> people<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.159> shocking
