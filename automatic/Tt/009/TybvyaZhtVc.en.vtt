Coast route of a motor home a few main
reasons<00:00:34.360> one<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.719> a<00:00:34.780> really<00:00:34.930> nice<00:00:35.170> size<00:00:35.500> it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
reasons one it's a really nice size it's

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.910 
reasons one it's a really nice size it's
not<00:00:36.070> too<00:00:36.280> big<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.760> it's<00:00:36.820> not<00:00:37.000> too<00:00:37.149> small<00:00:37.920> so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
not too big and it's not too small so

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.010 
not too big and it's not too small so
I'm<00:00:39.250> it<00:00:39.370> still<00:00:39.610> able<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.180> like<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.840> left

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
I'm it still able to like the left

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.580 
I'm it still able to like the left
across<00:00:41.530> here<00:00:41.770> like<00:00:41.800> this<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:44.140> about<00:00:44.350> one

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
across here like this that's about one

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.190 
across here like this that's about one
point<00:00:44.829> eight<00:00:45.070> meter<00:00:45.340> wide<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.630> it's<00:00:46.840> wide

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
point eight meter wide so it's wide

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720 
point eight meter wide so it's wide
enough<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.470> be<00:00:47.739> with<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.980> light<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:48.370> way<00:00:48.579> or

enough to be with the light this way or

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.330 
enough to be with the light this way or
that<00:00:48.760> way<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:50.200> it's<00:00:50.380> narrow<00:00:50.680> enough<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:50.980> go<00:00:51.190> in

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
that way but it's narrow enough to go in

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.130 
that way but it's narrow enough to go in
the<00:00:51.430> national<00:00:51.880> parks<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.480> down<00:00:52.660> some<00:00:52.899> tracks
