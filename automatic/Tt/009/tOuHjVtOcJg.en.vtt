them might have overfed and spiked the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.310 
them might have overfed and spiked the
ammonia<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.989> everything<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:03.170> instead<00:01:04.170> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
ammonia and everything but instead of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
ammonia and everything but instead of
doing<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.309> went<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:07.490> $25<00:01:08.490> cheap

little tube that comes off the top to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
little tube that comes off the top to
help<00:01:19.229> control<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:21.650> water<00:01:22.650> flow<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
help control the water flow so that it

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
help control the water flow so that it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
doesn't pass by too fast and it might

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.810 
doesn't pass by too fast and it might
actually<00:01:26.070> work<00:01:28.040> we'll<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.340> happens<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
actually work we'll see what happens I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.690 
actually work we'll see what happens I
bought<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> online<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.689> $25<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.280> got<00:01:32.490> here

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bought it online for $25 and got here

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.410 
bought it online for $25 and got here
pretty<00:01:32.880> quick

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.060 

some<00:01:36.420> people<00:01:36.689> say<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.020> work<00:01:37.200> great<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.770> some

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
some people say they work great and some

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
some people say they work great and some
would<00:01:38.790> never<00:01:39.000> use<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> right

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
would never use it but I put it right

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.160 
would never use it but I put it right
there<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> front<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:41.869> because<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
there in front for now because if it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.940 
there in front for now because if it
works

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
works

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.210 
works
hopefully<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> never<00:01:45.060> need<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.479> again<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
hopefully I never need it again but if I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
hopefully I never need it again but if I
do<00:01:47.280> ever<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.570> sign<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> algae

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
do ever see the first sign of algae

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.160 
do ever see the first sign of algae
again<00:01:49.770> I'll<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.640> able<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.299> stick<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> back

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
again I'll be able to just stick it back

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.679 
again I'll be able to just stick it back
in<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> hopefully<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.240> if

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
in there and hopefully I don't know if

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.999 
in there and hopefully I don't know if
I'm<00:01:55.560> supposed<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.990> let<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> run<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.799> all

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I'm supposed to let it run in there all

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
I'm supposed to let it run in there all
the<00:01:59.159> time<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.850> stick<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> corner

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the time you know stick it in a corner

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
the time you know stick it in a corner
someplace<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.799> tank<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.390> let

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
someplace and back the tank and just let

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 
someplace and back the tank and just let
it<00:02:03.479> run<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.640> needed<00:02:06.119> I'm

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
