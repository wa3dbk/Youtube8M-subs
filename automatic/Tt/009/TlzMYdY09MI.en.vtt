on

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.450 

we<00:01:06.950> just<00:01:07.219> create<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.790> plain<00:01:08.240> easily<00:01:09.460> and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
we just create this plain easily and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.969 
we just create this plain easily and
just<00:01:10.909> make<00:01:11.180> sure<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:11.750> one<00:01:12.110> by<00:01:12.619> one

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
just make sure you have one by one

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.450 
just make sure you have one by one
segment<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.299> going<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.530> top<00:01:15.770> view<00:01:16.009> now<00:01:16.430> we

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
segment and going to the top view now we

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.870 
segment and going to the top view now we
are<00:01:16.759> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.390> use<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.680> base<00:01:19.009> mesh<00:01:19.340> base

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
are going to use this base mesh base

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.480 
are going to use this base mesh base
plane<00:01:20.329> for<00:01:21.039> creating<00:01:22.060> texture<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:25.250> we're

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
plane for creating texture so we're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.270 
plane for creating texture so we're
going<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.850> go<00:01:26.030> back<00:01:26.420> into<00:01:26.720> box<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.710> we're

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
going to go back into box and we're

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.559 
going to go back into box and we're
going<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.909> make<00:01:29.539> sure<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:33.100> cover<00:01:34.100> these

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
going to make sure we we we cover these

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.830 
going to make sure we we we cover these
corners<00:01:35.569> first<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.340> we're<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:37.970> create

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
corners first so we're going to create

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.320 
corners first so we're going to create
something<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:39.799> this

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
something like this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.600 
something like this
three<00:01:41.930> by<00:01:42.110> three<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.590> then<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:43.160> push<00:01:43.400> out

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
three by three and then just push out

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.880 
three by three and then just push out
push<00:01:43.880> up<00:01:44.470> until<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.800> height<00:01:46.420> sixteen

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
push up until you have height sixteen

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.520 
push up until you have height sixteen
make<00:01:48.890> sure<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.220> have<00:01:49.400> snap<00:01:49.700> toggle<00:01:49.880> turned<00:01:50.210> on

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
make sure you have snap toggle turned on

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.790 
make sure you have snap toggle turned on
and<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:51.560> we're<00:01:52.370> going<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.760> W<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:54.170> move<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
and now we're going to W to move it and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.710 
and now we're going to W to move it and
we<00:01:55.610> have<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.240> move<00:01:56.480> pivot<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.970> can<00:01:59.300> more

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
we have to move pivot so we can more

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.550 
we have to move pivot so we can more
easily<00:01:59.930> align<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.160> newly<00:02:01.580> created<00:02:02.140> box<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
easily align the newly created box to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.820 
easily align the newly created box to
the<00:02:03.710> rest<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.720> grid<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.170> we're<00:02:06.470> going<00:02:06.710> to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the rest of the grid so we're going to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.450 
the rest of the grid so we're going to
hold<00:02:07.190> shift<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.940> click<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:09.140> drag<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:10.130> make

fourth<00:02:35.630> corner<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.830> now<00:02:37.400> we're<00:02:37.850> going<00:02:38.120> to

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
fourth corner and now we're going to

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.490 
fourth corner and now we're going to
create<00:02:38.870> some<00:02:39.440> additional

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.330 

there's<00:02:44.130> no

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
there's no

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.600 
there's no
boxes<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:47.080> represent

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.229 

the<00:02:49.910> edges<00:02:50.390> that

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.229 

I<00:02:54.269> got<00:02:55.019> well<00:02:55.730> I'm<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.969> to<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.239> covered

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
I got well I'm going to be covered

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.179 
I got well I'm going to be covered
separately<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:01.049> now<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.790> again<00:03:04.189> move

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
separately and now we have to again move

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.690 
separately and now we have to again move
them<00:03:05.719> holding<00:03:06.719> shift<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.409> making<00:03:07.829> sure

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.000 

while<00:03:11.209> we're<00:03:11.569> not<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.050> do<00:03:12.319> this<00:03:12.470> like

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
while we're not going to do this like

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.000 
while we're not going to do this like
that<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:14.030> first<00:03:14.330> effect<00:03:15.230> pivot<00:03:15.709> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
that we have to first effect pivot and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.110 
that we have to first effect pivot and
we<00:03:16.750> position<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> pivot<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.610> we<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.790> snap

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
we position the pivot so we can snap

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.290 
we position the pivot so we can snap
exactly<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.110> point<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:21.920> want<00:03:22.300> here

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
exactly to the point that we want here

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.949 
exactly to the point that we want here
we<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.069> without<00:03:25.760> moving<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.660> pivot

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
we can do it without moving the pivot

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.490 
we can do it without moving the pivot
point

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740 

here<00:03:30.100> also

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.500 

and<00:03:32.960> here<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:33.800> will<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.490> realign<00:03:35.330> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
and here we will have to realign the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.660 
and here we will have to realign the
pivot<00:03:36.170> again

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.699 

sooo

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
sooo

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.530 
sooo
just<00:03:41.040> holding<00:03:41.489> shift<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.120> click<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.450> drag

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
just holding shift and click and drag

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.800 
just holding shift and click and drag
and<00:03:42.989> making<00:03:43.319> sure<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.859> have<00:03:43.909> two<00:03:44.909> squares<00:03:45.390> on

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and making sure you have two squares on

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.369 
and making sure you have two squares on
the<00:03:46.200> plane<00:03:46.439> because<00:03:46.680> two<00:03:47.099> squares<00:03:47.489> are

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
the plane because two squares are

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.729 
the plane because two squares are
looking<00:03:49.379> over<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:51.000> now<00:03:51.209> going<00:03:51.810> back<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.379> create

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
looking over so now going back to create

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.979 
looking over so now going back to create
we<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.310> fill<00:03:53.760> out<00:03:53.989> fill<00:03:54.989> up

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.240 

the<00:03:58.470> rest<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.220> plane<00:03:59.640> let<00:04:00.269> me<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:01.250> use

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the rest of the plane let me just use

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.190 
the rest of the plane let me just use
some<00:04:02.489> different<00:04:02.640> colors<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.629> can<00:04:03.780> see<00:04:04.019> what

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
some different colors so we can see what

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.259 
some different colors so we can see what
we<00:04:04.379> are<00:04:04.409> doing<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:07.260> make<00:04:07.439> sure<00:04:08.269> you

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
we are doing and just make sure you

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.210 
we are doing and just make sure you
create<00:04:10.220> boxes<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:13.079> are<00:04:13.140> not<00:04:13.470> going<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:14.010> be

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
create boxes that are not going to be

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.729 
create boxes that are not going to be
the<00:04:14.579> same<00:04:14.959> width<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.289> land<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:18.150> you

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
the same width and land and that you

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.999 
the same width and land and that you
make<00:04:20.600> diverse<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:23.000> horizontal<00:04:24.000> and

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
make diverse like horizontal and

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:30.540 
make diverse like horizontal and
vertical

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.590 

objects<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.540> doesn't<00:04:33.020> get<00:04:33.530> too<00:04:34.600> similar

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
objects so it doesn't get too similar

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.640 
objects so it doesn't get too similar
all<00:04:36.350> over<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.130> place<00:04:38.050> so<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.350> pretty

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
all over the place so this is pretty

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.380 
all over the place so this is pretty
tedious<00:04:39.890> job<00:04:40.520> but<00:04:40.550> because<00:04:41.300> we<00:04:41.630> have<00:04:42.700> snap<00:04:43.700> to

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
tedious job but because we have snap to

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.770 
tedious job but because we have snap to
agree<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.020> turn<00:04:45.350> on<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:46.640> much<00:04:46.940> faster<00:04:47.510> than

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
agree to turn on it's much faster than

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.490 
agree to turn on it's much faster than
it<00:04:48.080> would<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:49.400> we<00:04:49.730> would<00:04:50.000> want<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:51.020> create

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
it would be if we would want to create

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.530 
it would be if we would want to create
this<00:04:51.830> by<00:04:52.130> hand<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.830> just<00:04:55.130> fill<00:04:55.430> out<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.300> rest

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
this by hand so just fill out the rest

we<00:05:46.099> can<00:05:46.279> select<00:05:46.699> all<00:05:46.969> edges<00:05:47.449> of<00:05:47.809> different

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.089 
we can select all edges of different

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.420 
we can select all edges of different
elements<00:05:50.089> in<00:05:50.389> this<00:05:50.689> object<00:05:50.949> so<00:05:51.949> now<00:05:52.129> under

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
elements in this object so now under

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.820 
elements in this object so now under
edges<00:05:52.969> we're<00:05:53.389> going<00:05:53.659> to<00:05:53.839> hold<00:05:54.110> shift<00:05:54.559> and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
edges we're going to hold shift and

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.249 
edges we're going to hold shift and
chamfer<00:05:55.479> one<00:05:56.479> one<00:05:57.610> okay<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.789> then<00:05:59.419> go<00:05:59.449> back<00:06:00.050> to

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
chamfer one one okay and then go back to

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.260 
chamfer one one okay and then go back to
touch<00:06:01.039> list<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.999> attach<00:06:02.719> the<00:06:03.139> plane<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:04.520> we

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
touch list and attach the plane and we

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.399 
touch list and attach the plane and we
are<00:06:05.449> done<00:06:05.749> in<00:06:06.050> 2d<00:06:06.499> aspects<00:06:06.889> you<00:06:07.249> can<00:06:07.430> go<00:06:07.999> to

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
are done in 2d aspects you can go to

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:14.019 
are done in 2d aspects you can go to
ZBrush<00:06:10.149> but<00:06:11.149> first<00:06:11.419> you<00:06:11.689> should<00:06:11.740> go<00:06:12.740> up<00:06:13.639> here

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
ZBrush but first you should go up here

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.519 
ZBrush but first you should go up here
and<00:06:14.059> export<00:06:14.930> it<00:06:15.139> and<00:06:15.379> export<00:06:16.039> it<00:06:16.189> as<00:06:16.370> obj<00:06:16.939> or

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
and export it and export it as obj or

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.249 
and export it and export it as obj or
you<00:06:18.529> can<00:06:18.800> use<00:06:19.069> go<00:06:19.490> Z<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:19.999> go<00:06:20.389> ZBrush<00:06:20.809> and<00:06:20.990> you

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
you can use go Z and go ZBrush and you

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.889 
you can use go Z and go ZBrush and you
will<00:06:21.499> be<00:06:21.740> directly<00:06:22.689> put<00:06:23.689> into<00:06:24.229> ZBrush
