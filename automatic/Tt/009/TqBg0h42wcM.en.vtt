as you're going to see and then you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
as you're going to see and then you
basically<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.520> fly<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.479> bottom-right

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
basically just fly to the bottom-right

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
basically just fly to the bottom-right
of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> mat<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> hit<00:01:29.159> start<00:01:29.520> it'll

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of the mat like when you hit start it'll

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.069 
of the mat like when you hit start it'll
be<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> bottom<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.479> there's<00:01:30.630> nothing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
be at the bottom right there's nothing

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
be at the bottom right there's nothing
gonna<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> actual<00:01:32.280> map<00:01:32.430> you'll

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
gonna be on the actual map you'll

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
gonna be on the actual map you'll
eventually<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.110> see

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
eventually see it as you're gonna see

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
eventually see it as you're gonna see
here<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.710> second<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> fly<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.000> kind

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
here in a second when I fly there kind

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
here in a second when I fly there kind
of<00:01:36.270> speed<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.540> part<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.680> kinda

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of speed this part up but you can kinda

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
of speed this part up but you can kinda
get<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> general<00:01:38.790> direction<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.720> at

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
get a general direction of where it's at

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
get a general direction of where it's at
you<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.500> can't<00:01:40.799> miss<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.130> guys<00:01:41.250> like

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you really can't miss it guys like

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
you really can't miss it guys like
you'll<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.299> bunch<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.930> lights<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> bunch

you'll see a bunch of lights and a bunch

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679 
you'll see a bunch of lights and a bunch
of<00:01:43.860> mountains<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.369> stuff<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.820> also<00:01:45.149> if

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of mountains and stuff like that also if

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
of mountains and stuff like that also if
you<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> map<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you kind of want to map it out it's to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.700 
you kind of want to map it out it's to
the<00:01:47.729> east<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.570> actual<00:01:48.930> airport<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.619> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the east of the actual airport so if you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
the east of the actual airport so if you
go<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> airport<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
go to the airport you know you can go to

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
go to the airport you know you can go to
east<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.409> you'll<00:01:52.560> find<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> also

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
east of it and then you'll find it also

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.560 
east of it and then you'll find it also
as<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:53.880> there's<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.149> bridge<00:01:54.390> right

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
as you see there's this bridge right

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.030 
as you see there's this bridge right
here<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.140> there's<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> parking<00:01:56.009> lot

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
here and then there's like a parking lot

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.469 
here and then there's like a parking lot
down<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.490> where<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> crates<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
down there where all the crates and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
down there where all the crates and
shipping<00:01:57.750> stuff<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.070> general

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
shipping stuff is so that's a general

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
shipping stuff is so that's a general
vicinity<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.880> once<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.180> get<00:02:00.299> closer<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
vicinity but once you get closer to it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.889 
vicinity but once you get closer to it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you'll see this and there's some parts

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.090 
you'll see this and there's some parts
of<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.020> map<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.619> you're<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> see

is<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.360> most<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.020> time<00:05:10.290> when<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.560> do

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
is that most of the time when you do

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.410 
is that most of the time when you do
leave<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.100> game<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.520> join<00:05:11.850> back<00:05:12.060> the

although<00:05:14.850> one<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.150> my<00:05:15.210> friends<00:05:15.600> actually<00:05:15.690> did

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
although one of my friends actually did

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.810 
although one of my friends actually did
leave<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.860> then<00:05:16.980> join<00:05:17.220> back<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.670> was

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
leave and then join back and it was

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.150 
leave and then join back and it was
there<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.450> don't<00:05:19.230> really<00:05:19.410> know<00:05:19.680> what's<00:05:20.070> to
