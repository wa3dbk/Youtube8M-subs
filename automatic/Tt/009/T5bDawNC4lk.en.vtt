00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
because once I found the two or three

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.420 
because once I found the two or three
that<00:01:42.689> benefitted<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> most<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.250> kind

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

points with for a slightly higher price

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.609 
points with for a slightly higher price
because<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:00.930> buying<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.320> within<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
because you're buying them within the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
missiles or grenades though I was never

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.830 
missiles or grenades though I was never
even<00:02:06.090> close<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.840> hurting<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.380> perfect

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
even close to hurting for that perfect

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.020 
even close to hurting for that perfect
currency<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.619> did<00:02:09.039> actually<00:02:09.399> like<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.700> system

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
currency I did actually like the system

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.830 
currency I did actually like the system
and<00:02:10.149> thought<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.479> was<00:02:10.569> put<00:02:10.750> together

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and thought that it was put together

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.960 
and thought that it was put together
just<00:02:11.080> fine<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.099> worst<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.459> can<00:02:12.610> say<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.879> this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
game is that it shows its IO port miss

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.009 
game is that it shows its IO port miss
for<00:02:15.220> sure<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.760> best<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.540> say<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.870> that

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
for sure the best that I can say is that

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.780
