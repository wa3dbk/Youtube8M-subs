00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in the background works perfectly and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720 
in the background works perfectly and
that's<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.590> easy<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.070> use<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that's really easy to use and if you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
that's really easy to use and if you
ever<00:00:35.820> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> jump<00:00:36.450> back<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> app<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
ever want to jump back to the app you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
ever want to jump back to the app you
can<00:00:37.380> also<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.800> click<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> then

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
can also just click that there and then

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
can also just click that there and then
if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.559> does<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.129> reload

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
if you do that it does have to reload

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
if you do that it does have to reload
the<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:41.940> second<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.660> pretty<00:00:42.840> quick

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the little second but it's pretty quick

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.389 
the little second but it's pretty quick
and<00:00:44.300> there<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.450> some<00:00:45.690> problems<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.250> app

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and there are some problems with the app

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.229 
and there are some problems with the app
itself<00:00:48.829> like<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> really

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
itself like that there that was a really

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.110 
itself like that there that was a really
random<00:00:51.539> bug<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.460> sometimes<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> switch

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
random bug and sometimes when you switch

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.920 
random bug and sometimes when you switch
down<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.690> edge<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.410> 3g<00:00:56.180> because<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.629> drop

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
down to edge from 3g because of a drop

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470 
down to edge from 3g because of a drop
signal<00:00:58.469> or<00:00:58.680> ever<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.609> driving<00:01:00.090> somewhere

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
signal or ever you're driving somewhere

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.680 
signal or ever you're driving somewhere
it<00:01:01.140> sometimes<00:01:01.859> freezes<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.539> just

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it sometimes freezes up and you just

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.140 
it sometimes freezes up and you just
have<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> click<00:01:04.170> pause<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> play<00:01:04.920> again<00:01:05.309> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
have to click pause and play again so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
have to click pause and play again so
that's<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.390> annoying<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.159> pan

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that's really annoying but you can pan

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
that's really annoying but you can pan
stations<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.869> home<00:01:10.080> screen<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.830> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
stations to your home screen here like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.480 
stations to your home screen here like
this<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.439> then<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:13.830> supposed<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> able

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this and then you're supposed to be able

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
this and then you're supposed to be able
to<00:01:14.640> instantly<00:01:15.180> launch<00:01:15.479> them<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:16.350> from

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to instantly launch them right from

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
to instantly launch them right from
there<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.180> sometimes<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.299> works<00:01:18.479> sometimes

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
there and sometimes that works sometimes

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.450 
there and sometimes that works sometimes
that<00:01:19.140> doesn't<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.560> i<00:01:19.590> said<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.040> app<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that doesn't like i said this app is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.390 
that doesn't like i said this app is
kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> buggy<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.500> does<00:01:22.799> at<00:01:22.979> least<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
kind of buggy but it does at least have

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
kind of buggy but it does at least have
the<00:01:23.610> mango<00:01:23.970> functionality<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.229> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the mango functionality and it can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580 
the mango functionality and it can
instantly<00:01:25.979> resume<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> background

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
instantly resume and the background

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.179 
instantly resume and the background
streaming<00:01:29.460> works<00:01:29.640> perfectly<00:01:31.009> except<00:01:32.009> for

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
streaming works perfectly except for

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.830 
streaming works perfectly except for
when<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:32.549> those<00:01:32.790> random<00:01:33.150> bugs<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.570> course

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
when it has those random bugs of course

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.030 
when it has those random bugs of course
and<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.090> cache<00:01:36.420> stations<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and you can cache stations if you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
and you can cache stations if you
actually<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> upgraded<00:01:39.240> account<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
actually have the upgraded account and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
actually have the upgraded account and
you<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.159> usual<00:01:41.520> controls<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you have all the usual controls there

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
you have all the usual controls there
and<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.509> where<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.899> pan<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> station

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and that's where you can pan a station

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.600 
and that's where you can pan a station
to<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.950> home<00:01:44.159> screen<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.920> definitely<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to your home screen so it's definitely a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
to your home screen so it's definitely a
nice<00:01:47.759> improvement<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.140> interface<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
nice improvement but the interface is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.420 
nice improvement but the interface is
way<00:01:50.549> too<00:01:50.610> laggy<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.920> there's<00:01:52.920> too<00:01:53.070> many<00:01:53.130> bugs

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
way too laggy and there's too many bugs

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
way too laggy and there's too many bugs
in<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.270> any<00:01:54.630> quality<00:01:55.290> really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
in it for it to be any quality really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
in it for it to be any quality really
hopefully<00:01:56.670> pandora<00:01:57.149> will<00:01:57.390> release<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.930> app

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
hopefully pandora will release an app

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.850 
hopefully pandora will release an app
and<00:01:58.380> hopefully<00:01:59.009> that'll<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:01:59.640> better

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
and hopefully that'll be a little better

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.550 
and hopefully that'll be a little better
but<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.310> now<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.850> looks<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.450> slacker<00:02:04.380> radio

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
but for now it looks like slacker radio
