00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
last episode I well kind of the last two

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
last episode I well kind of the last two
episodes<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.460> guess<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.030> did<00:01:15.210> knock<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> bridge

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
episodes I guess we did knock a bridge

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
episodes I guess we did knock a bridge
then<00:01:16.260> we<00:01:16.350> went<00:01:16.470> through<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.130> changed<00:01:17.580> build

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
then we went through and changed build

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.190 
then we went through and changed build
back<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.509> man<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.240> got<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> SS<00:01:21.750> ticket<00:01:22.050> off

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.290 
back into man and got the SS ticket off
him<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.190> basically<00:01:23.399> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> what

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
him so that's basically kind of what

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.450 
him so that's basically kind of what
happened<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> last<00:01:24.660> episode<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> around

that area

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.450 
that area
okay<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.020> there's<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.350> many<00:01:28.470> trainers<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.310> all

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
going to be a bit of a problem for my

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.949 
going to be a bit of a problem for my
physical<00:04:20.489> attacks<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.510> not<00:04:21.660> doing<00:04:21.840> very

much I'm guessing so I can probably take

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.780 
much I'm guessing so I can probably take
like<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.470> can<00:04:25.620> probably<00:04:25.770> do<00:04:26.010> like<00:04:26.280> another<00:04:26.550> one

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
like I can probably do like another one

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.469

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
nicely so I hit on attack again it's
