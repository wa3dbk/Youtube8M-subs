00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.100
 what happens tigers and well here we are 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.830
 in battlefield 4 and good as you can see 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.500
 Well I bring you a game with the cw 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.630
 eren assault is a game a gameplay 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 old that had kept debate 54 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.210
 but today it was not coming 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.250
 focusing on what has been in the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.949
 gameplay I did not want to focus on others 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.710
 topics but before saying that I'm going then 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.600
 with the ac wr and simply because it gave me 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.980
 by using it I do not know is a weapon that I think 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.989
 what does it have to do with it? 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 little bit of skill but good the truth is 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.090
 that is a weapon that I like no no no no 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.980
 stop convincing and use it sometimes 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
 but it's not not one of my favorites 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.380
 Exactly you have to tell the truth but 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.160
 good apart from that because today I come to 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.250
 tell you some new news again 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.100
 dlc dragon tips you already know it is a dlc 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.649
 is the fourth of lcd bat felix four in 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.180
 total are five also this final is 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.239
 so, but 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.020
 we have yet to see dragon tick 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.080
 for example so the new news is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.570
 that you already know in a video 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.270
 I told you what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.080
 the novelties that the dragon and the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.229
 arms the shield and good several several 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.840
 not, but this time, talk 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.880
 from a kind of robot with a 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.680
 mime not in which in that then that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.290
 robot what he did is simply you what 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.509
 deployed on the battlefield and your 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.550
 with the mimic they were killing 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.160
 really know the charger that has that 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.979
 yes reduced if it's older I do not really know 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.630
 I did not very much agree there with 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.670
 that of the robot the truth is not a thing 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.840
 Thank you very much but good 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 it turns out that on the page on the page 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.049
 battlefield officer because an 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.799
 and they have officially announced that the 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.920
 round round so it's called the robot vale 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.530
 with the mini range it will be a battle 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.080
 pica is worth what does this mean, as a 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.709
 battle pickup sincerely what you want 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.720
 to say is that we can take it on the map 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.730
 I do not know if you have seen that there are some 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.550
 sniper rifles pulled by the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.830
 map that we can take them and they are 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.780
 quite lethal but we can catch it 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.910
 by the map are scattered in parts 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.290
 of the key map and if we take it then 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.180
 we can use it until they are 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.000
 spend as he sees what is still the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.709
 ammunition well this is the case of 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.590
 this robot the raw then also 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.769
 contradictory with something I've seen a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.610
 image that you should do of course 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.540
 it's false I suppose on the subject that I 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.040
 puzzled a bit because I've seen if 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.650
 have said this official information os 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.500
 I'm going to put an image on the screen and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.540
 this image on the screen 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.130
 is going to leave you a little disconcerted today 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.590
 you are going to think good if it is a battle 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.310
 pickup this image of where it has come from 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.650
 really why why is it placed 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.210
 as if it were some accessory that does not 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.790
 we put him we do not put him in battle 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.459
 it's not a little strange I do not know what 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.120
 you will think but I really 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.380
 I'm a bit confused a little fly no 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.180
 I know if this because to what extent is it 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.680
 truth is this 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.650
 this photo or this information 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.860
 official is a bit is a bit strange not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.410
 I know if you give dais to rectified 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.709
 last time he said he preferred 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.500
 maybe the robot put it then rather 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.959
 as pick pickup toilet that eye on me 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.959
 it seems much better because I think that a 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.090
 basic equipment robot for 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.440
 he is true or I think it is a hindrance 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.130
 quite curious for others 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.680
 players and I think as usual 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.989
 we make many of the players of 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.720
 butterfield and any video game 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.300
 shooter or multiplayer 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.880
 we misuse the things we do 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.280
 we use them in excess not really 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.959
 for example the c 4 is the one we use in 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.060
 excess and the whites and all those things 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.160
 all the facilities that do not give us 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.950
 we use it too much then 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.680
 that hinders other ways of 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.750
 play as for example the routing and everything 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.629
 that kind of thing what for a bit 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.879
 then it's a bit 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.629
 contradictory then simply because 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.699
 that 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.550
 I do not know what you think, I already 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.430
 you will say your opinions but you see and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.830
 I do not know what you think this this little 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.139
 robot with the mimic of how 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.199
 would you prefer it to be 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.909
 was equipped on the basis that is not 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.129
 we could equip before starting the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.840
 starting or really not what 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.789
 let's find for what's coming but the 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.470
 battlefield I really have already 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.759
 said what I think I think the best is 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.800
 that we do not find it in the field of 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.930
 battle and that ammunition will be subtracted 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.460
 and that's because if I would not be a whore 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.330
 robots war of that of the eggs 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.430
 everywhere and I think the u2 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.470
 it's also that it was something easy to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.669
 destroy not I believe something that not no 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.289
 we had no problem with 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.199
 destroy lion or just tell him 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:27.940
 enough rods some like that a little 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.890
 more a little less but 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.350
 is not something affordable something we can 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.820
 kill well but well I do not know what you think 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.190
 you will give me yours 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.600
