00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.760
 very good everyone keeps their windows 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.990
 and up to krishna daily video and today be 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.940
 here as I'm watching with a gameplay 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.760
 in white this yes gentlemen I'm here in 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.320
 seek to instruct on the drones map a 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.760
 map that good lately I'm not 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.040
 playing a lot I do not know about you 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.960
 often plays a lot because people do not 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.610
 ends to convince but good I've 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.320
 put the best moments so 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.240
 general and some some rounds 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.630
 practically whole of this search and 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.789
 destroy in which then if I pulled out 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.619
 practically the nuclear I stay two 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.679
 front there is not because of a problem of mine is 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.909
 a problem of the good heat and 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.329
 game because you already know that the connection 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.100
 it's going to be fatal, you'll see it at the end 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.649
 surely many will see it but I think 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.690
 that is not only that statut is plywood 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.889
 with this 4 that comes to that if I go to 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.989
 do they were all because they call 

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.780
 tornadoes and I got the triplicate or 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.429
 a baby ring because it is not a clip of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.589
 three to search and destroy is nothing 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.899
 wrong with the c4 maybe it's a tad 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.049
 of points but good I am bringing you 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.399
 a pretty short leg we're 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.859
 bringing to the best moments like 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.080
 you are seeing what it is that they seek 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.130
 destroy to get it out the good nuclear 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.020
 We have to try 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.670
 and winning a round is easy because you have 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.770
 invention you have to kill or defend a 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 pump but it's hard to lose a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 round then if it is the good plant 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.289
 since you practically have a round 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.659
 What is missing , for example , is 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.820
 we already lost it and if it's not planting and that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.890
 you get deactivated because that's more 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.539
 difficult you want me not and here already what 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.429
 short because in this good round now 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.189
 that exploding the bomb and as you can see 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.689
 is that it's not that good I could take 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.280
 the elements easily you know that these 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.319
 enemies so strong that they were very or 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.970
 very bad what many of you complain about 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.009
 well, these enemies were pretty 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 good because they let me look and they let me 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.179
 a lot of times reddish and good because 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.979
 I'm putting some view the best 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.490
 moments here I'll take care of the next 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.259
 to do with 15-0 and good as 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.080
 You know, it's done a lot, I took the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.819
 double in seeking and destroying having warfare 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 3 that you will have it by the description that 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.539
 we made a montage when he did the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.840
 that was pretty cool pretty cool and 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.459
 Well, the nuclear one has also taken me out 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.439
 nuclear bomb in warfare 2 looking 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.329
 destroy but it has happened to a 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.220
 editor to see if it ends it told me that 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.200
 in a couple of weeks I would surely have 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.350
 finish 10 because I passed it to di 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.950
 girl but 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.300
 no it was not inside where this was 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.620
 doing other things and in the end he told me 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 that he was not going to have time that they had to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.000
 edit other things and nothing at the end 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.920
 I had to pass it to another editor who 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 surely he will do it quite well because 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.630
 Synchronization very knowledgeable and was 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.670
 pretty good in some search tops 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.190
 and house of bush that you gave some tops 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.690
 After Beijing S &amp; P answers and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.280
 as it is here I was shocked this 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.770
 boy and I had a moment of man that or 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.560
 successes but do not take out the pistol with a 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.140
 shot and how am I using the in 94 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.520
 the writing with silencer and cylinder head and 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.330
 then secondary as you have seen the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.400
 pistolita the attack 45 and then already of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.770
 advantages as scavenger not because we 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.870
 you are going to kill only 6 and it does not work 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.000
 the scavenger llar as they have seen a 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 mate killed me one of an impact 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.990
 direct but good that is being said 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.210
 of advantages I think it takes ghost and 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.130
 hard line or ghost the vest does not 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.230
 ghost in bulletproof vest and diego 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.170
 bulletproofing and then came 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.190
 hardness it seems to me that good hardness 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.210
 it seems that it is a thing that is quite 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.070
 well to search and destroy for 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.870
 try, you see, you are leaving 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.170
 I ruiz 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.510
 and as it is not that the reddest still does not 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.940
 it's impossible that they let me distrust 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.850
 a lot and I had youtube a few meters 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.380
 of markets also with brutal 25 me 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.050
 could have pulled out if it had been a 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.310
 love would have taken me out already called to put 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.010
 a previous low that would have led 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.260
 hard line and good a little more than the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.810
 shots will shortly come the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.050
 tragic moment like how to say the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.030
 repeated that yesterday will go nuclear with 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.520
 the execution of the see if you pass that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 we were a few to reach the thousand 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.180
 I like to thank you all 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 that you vote you are and well I will put 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.290
 a challenge to see those who are so 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.660
 liked to you that I always am is 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.010
 meet that good after this 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.470
 departure of you trying a couple 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.510
 of more times and ended up coming the nuclear 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.990
 and I'm going to propose is a challenge that is 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.000
 when this video arrives in 2006 I upload 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.830
 was used to those 30 casualties with 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.510
 in search of destroying that nuclear already 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.940
 look and say that he also killed a couple 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.160
 more or two more not exactly I do not know if 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.860
 killed two or three more and it was pretty 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.140
 well the game itself so nothing 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.060
 when we get to the thousands of this 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.650
 It would be if it's Tuesday and if we get to 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.910
 most taxes tomorrow if within 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.520
 a couple of days inside a couple of days 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.580
 and if it does not, it never arrives 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.470
 day diego I arrived and if not then what 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.880
 I will upload because nothing happens because 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.340
 when I was left with nothing to go up 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.080
 I will not climb alone, you will see me 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 that the critical moment in the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.590
 the end of the round we have lost and 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.120
 what is happening, then nothing that some 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.100
 Funny, I did not want him to take my 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.350
 departure and then began to leave the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.210
 You see and nothing broken connection and 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.460
 I started to scream like a mess 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.380
 it bothers me a lot to be finished 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.610
 the game in this way you have 28-0 me 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.080
 there were two nuclear stop 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.030
 what I said, I hope you liked it 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.470
 you throw it to get to those thousands if 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.070
 you were this example already with the 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.070
 nuclear itself 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.260
 no no
