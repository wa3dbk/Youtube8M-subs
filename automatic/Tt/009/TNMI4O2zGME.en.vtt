some innovation so thanks to both and I
really<00:00:33.950> appreciate<00:00:34.430> it<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:35.320> yeah<00:00:36.460> today<00:00:37.460> the

really appreciate it and yeah today the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.740 
really appreciate it and yeah today the
focus<00:00:38.060> is<00:00:38.540> on<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.170> new<00:00:39.820> seemed<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.850> spot<00:00:41.450> door

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
focus is on the new seemed a spot door

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.570 
focus is on the new seemed a spot door
and<00:00:43.390> here's<00:00:44.390> how<00:00:44.570> it<00:00:44.660> works<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:46.040> when<00:00:46.310> you<00:00:46.400> get

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
and here's how it works so when you get

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.910 
and here's how it works so when you get
this<00:00:46.670> button<00:00:48.580> it'll<00:00:49.580> close<00:00:49.940> like<00:00:50.240> that<00:00:50.920> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
this button it'll close like that and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
this button it'll close like that and
then<00:00:52.070> by<00:00:52.310> placing<00:00:52.670> torch<00:00:53.270> here<00:00:53.750> or<00:00:54.460> here<00:00:55.460> it'll

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
then by placing torch here or here it'll

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.830 
then by placing torch here or here it'll
open<00:00:56.060> up<00:00:56.330> very<00:00:56.690> quickly<00:00:57.130> and<00:00:58.329> it'll<00:00:59.329> hide<00:00:59.570> that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
open up very quickly and it'll hide that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.899 
open up very quickly and it'll hide that
listen<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:00.470> don't<00:01:00.590> see<00:01:00.860> anything<00:01:02.440> which<00:01:03.440> is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
listen you don't see anything which is

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:15.520 
listen you don't see anything which is
very<00:01:04.909> good<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:11.530> how<00:01:12.530> does<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:12.770> work<00:01:14.530> whenever

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
very good so how does this work whenever

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.630 
very good so how does this work whenever
this<00:01:15.860> piston<00:01:16.280> hearings<00:01:17.290> extended<00:01:18.430> its<00:01:19.430> not

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
this piston hearings extended its not

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.460 
this piston hearings extended its not
powered<00:01:20.440> but<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.400> original<00:01:23.360> bad<00:01:24.170> door

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
powered but in the original bad door

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.670 
powered but in the original bad door
which<00:01:25.100> was<00:01:25.370> not<00:01:25.640> seamless<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.450> was<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:27.500> this

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
which was not seamless it was just this

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.030 
which was not seamless it was just this
piston<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.310> now<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:29.060> also<00:01:29.990> these<00:01:30.530> business

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
piston and now it's also these business

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.310 
piston and now it's also these business
in<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.310> side<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.049> this<00:01:33.049> one<00:01:33.320> down<00:01:33.500> here<00:01:33.560> and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
in the side and this one down here and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.399 
in the side and this one down here and
what's<00:01:36.320> happening<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.920> when<00:01:37.310> this<00:01:37.490> one

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
what's happening is when this one

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.500 
what's happening is when this one
attracts<00:01:39.409> then<00:01:39.830> that<00:01:40.070> will<00:01:40.370> updates<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
attracts then that will updates the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.230 
attracts then that will updates the
pistons<00:01:41.870> on<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.110> slide<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.520> they<00:01:43.729> will<00:01:43.909> then

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
pistons on the slide so they will then

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.730 
pistons on the slide so they will then
retract<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.650> block<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:48.260> it'll<00:01:48.500> take

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
retract this and the block so it'll take

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.340 
retract this and the block so it'll take
them<00:01:48.890> down<00:01:49.100> there<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.690> then<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:51.110> will

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
them down there and then that will

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.289 
them down there and then that will
update<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:51.950> piston<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.640> that's<00:01:52.909> where<00:01:53.180> it

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
update this piston and that's where it

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.719 
update this piston and that's where it
takes<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:53.869> from<00:01:54.049> for<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.560> rest<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.549> the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
takes it in from for the rest of the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.289 
takes it in from for the rest of the
retraction<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:57.610> that's<00:01:58.610> basically<00:01:58.880> how<00:01:59.180> it

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
retraction and that's basically how it

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.100 
retraction and that's basically how it
works<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.979> didn't<00:02:01.510> think<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.720> myself

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
works and I didn't think of that myself

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.199 
works and I didn't think of that myself
I<00:02:03.880> was<00:02:04.880> too<00:02:05.450> lazy<00:02:05.750> or<00:02:05.930> something<00:02:06.700> or<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.729> was

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
I was too lazy or something or I was

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.410 
I was too lazy or something or I was

going<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.180> block<00:03:21.480> top<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.170> then<00:03:22.350> we'll

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
going to have a block top and then we'll

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to have a block top and then we'll
be<00:03:22.880> controlled<00:03:23.880> by<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> pistol<00:03:25.520> then<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.700> want

be controlled by a pistol then you want

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.810 
be controlled by a pistol then you want
your<00:03:27.209> input<00:03:27.480> block<00:03:27.870> right<00:03:28.140> there<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:29.400> place

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
your input block right there then place

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.560 
your input block right there then place
your<00:03:29.850> bottom<00:03:32.209> there<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:34.940> two<00:03:35.940> torches<00:03:36.270> like

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
your bottom there and two torches like

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
power at the beer and this torch is also

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.630 
power at the beer and this torch is also
going<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.800> block<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.070> top<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.580> the

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
going to have a block on top of the

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.820 
going to have a block on top of the
torch<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:13.010> another<00:04:14.010> one<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.550> then<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.510> end

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
torch and another one and then the end

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.510 
torch and another one and then the end
one<00:04:16.830> on<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> slide<00:04:18.680> two<00:04:19.680> blocks<00:04:20.010> right<00:04:20.220> here

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
one on the slide two blocks right here

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.990 
one on the slide two blocks right here
and<00:04:20.760> they<00:04:21.060> appear<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:21.989> ticks

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and they appear on for ticks

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.210 
and they appear on for ticks
and<00:04:23.120> this<00:04:23.780> will<00:04:23.960> then<00:04:24.230> bud<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:27.590> world<00:04:27.860> bud

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
and this will then bud this world bud

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.410 
and this will then bud this world bud
this<00:04:28.880> pistol<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:30.830> will<00:04:31.040> power<00:04:31.340> if<00:04:32.240> you

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
this pistol and it will power if you

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.930 
this pistol and it will power if you
have<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.690> dress<00:04:32.870> from<00:04:33.080> there<00:04:33.260> I'm<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.590> block

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
have the dress from there I'm this block

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.040 
have the dress from there I'm this block
the<00:04:34.940> power<00:04:35.180> these<00:04:35.480> two<00:04:35.750> pistons<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:38.050> before

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
the power these two pistons and before

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.020 
the power these two pistons and before
that<00:04:39.080> happens<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:39.920> for<00:04:40.250> these<00:04:40.460> Pistons<00:04:40.880> here

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
that happens so for these Pistons here

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.380 
that happens so for these Pistons here
extend<00:04:41.860> it'll<00:04:43.720> push<00:04:44.720> down<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:44.960> column<00:04:46.390> using

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
extend it'll push down the column using

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.920 
extend it'll push down the column using
this<00:04:48.110> modular<00:04:48.860> suite<00:04:49.360> which<00:04:50.360> has<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.600> block

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
this modular suite which has a block

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.050 
this modular suite which has a block
limit<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:51.980> play<00:04:52.250> sticky<00:04:52.580> piston<00:04:52.940> right

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
limit and then play sticky piston right

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.380 
limit and then play sticky piston right
there<00:04:54.550> then<00:04:55.550> from<00:04:55.760> this<00:04:55.910> wrestling<00:04:56.300> you're

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
there then from this wrestling you're

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.500 
there then from this wrestling you're
going<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.750> have<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> block<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.940> another

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
going to have a block and then another

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.620 
going to have a block and then another
repeater<00:05:00.340> right<00:05:01.340> there<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.820> three<00:05:02.240> types<00:05:02.510> of

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
repeater right there on three types of

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.770 
repeater right there on three types of
like<00:05:03.250> not<00:05:04.250> folding<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.820> into<00:05:05.000> this<00:05:05.419> redstone

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
like not folding it into this redstone

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
like not folding it into this redstone
here<00:05:06.080> which<00:05:06.380> will<00:05:06.560> bought<00:05:07.030> these<00:05:08.030> pistons<00:05:08.570> and

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
here which will bought these pistons and

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.870 
here which will bought these pistons and
the<00:05:09.800> piston<00:05:10.130> in<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.310> middle<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.640> door

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
the piston in the middle of the door

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.159 
the piston in the middle of the door
will<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.090> bought<00:05:11.390> it<00:05:11.510> for<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:11.900> restaurant

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
will be bought it for this restaurant

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.990 
will be bought it for this restaurant
here<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.720> that's<00:05:15.080> basically<00:05:15.230> it's<00:05:16.010> not<00:05:16.730> just

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
here so that's basically it's not just

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.670 
here so that's basically it's not just
fill<00:05:17.360> this<00:05:17.450> up<00:05:17.660> here<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:20.200> this<00:05:21.200> is<00:05:21.380> going<00:05:21.590> to

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
fill this up here and this is going to

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.230 
fill this up here and this is going to
be<00:05:21.830> on<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.040> door<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.690> just<00:05:23.690> test<00:05:24.500> out<00:05:25.240> let's

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
be on the door and just test out let's

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.130 
be on the door and just test out let's
have<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.480> look<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.020> close<00:05:30.320> this<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:32.140> it

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
have a look so to close this and it

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.409 
have a look so to close this and it
opens<00:05:34.870> now<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.930> can<00:05:36.229> actually<00:05:36.640> just<00:05:37.640> move

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
opens now you can actually just move

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.590 
opens now you can actually just move
this<00:05:40.479> like<00:05:41.479> that<00:05:41.720> then<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.050> get<00:05:42.350> this<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:43.600> now

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
this like that then you get this and now

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.250 
this like that then you get this and now
if<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.460> put<00:05:46.460> this<00:05:47.050> like<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.380> then<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.430> get<00:05:49.700> a<00:05:50.260> 2

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
if I put this like so then you get a 2

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.180 
if I put this like so then you get a 2
by<00:05:51.440> 2<00:05:51.760> but<00:05:52.760> door<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:54.680> just<00:05:54.890> filled

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
by 2 but door and I just filled

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.680 
by 2 but door and I just filled
everything<00:05:55.550> up<00:05:56.050> so<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.410> know<00:05:57.880> but<00:05:58.880> before<00:05:59.330> you

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
everything up so you know but before you

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.930 
everything up so you know but before you
have<00:05:59.900> this<00:06:00.140> you'll<00:06:00.590> need<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:00.830> make<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.700> few

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
have this you'll need to make a few
