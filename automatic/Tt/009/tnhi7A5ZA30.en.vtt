00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
you just plug your widgets and you stop

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.850 
you just plug your widgets and you stop
that<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:45.360> throw<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.200> want

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.080 

by<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.890> way<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.519> resistive

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
by the way this is a resistive

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.350 
by the way this is a resistive
touchscreen<00:02:52.340> which<00:02:53.340> works<00:02:53.730> actually<00:02:54.120> really

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
touchscreen which works actually really

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
touchscreen which works actually really
well<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:57.230> again<00:02:58.230> I've<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.769> had<00:02:58.860> no<00:02:59.010> problems

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
well and again I've not had no problems

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.190 
well and again I've not had no problems
with<00:02:59.459> I've<00:02:59.700> had<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> few<00:03:00.239> days<00:03:00.540> now<00:03:00.930> I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
with I've had it for a few days now I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.009 
with I've had it for a few days now I
got<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> day<00:03:02.070> after<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.459> came<00:03:02.670> out<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.150> think

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
got it a day after it came out I think

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.259 
got it a day after it came out I think
came<00:03:04.380> out<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.829> 16th<00:03:07.820> see<00:03:08.820> Broyles<00:03:09.090> can

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
came out on the 16th see Broyles can

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.110 
came out on the 16th see Broyles can
take<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.690> next<00:03:10.019> we're<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.440> messaging

again it Scrolls well for being a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.170 
again it Scrolls well for being a
resistive<00:03:18.420> touchscreen<00:03:19.880> good<00:03:20.880> create

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
resistive touchscreen good create

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
works well i also got your camera now

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.090 
works well i also got your camera now
when<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.449> go<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.570> your<00:05:06.720> camera<00:05:07.229> it

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
when you go to your camera it

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.230 
when you go to your camera it
automatically<00:05:08.580> went<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.880> flip<00:05:09.120> it

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
automatically went to the flip it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.469 
automatically went to the flip it
sideways<00:05:12.320> again<00:05:13.320> it's<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.620> 3.0<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:15.060> also<00:05:15.240> has

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
sideways again it's a 3.0 it also has
