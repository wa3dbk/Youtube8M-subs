would<00:00:41.449> you<00:00:41.570> propose<00:00:41.900> there<00:00:42.559> is<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.769> generally

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
would you propose there is a generally

accepted pattern in this area I would

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.780 
accepted pattern in this area I would
pick<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.620> up<00:00:45.769> take<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.309> restaurant

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
pick you up take you to a restaurant

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.119 
pick you up take you to a restaurant
then<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:47.600> would<00:00:47.750> see<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.900> movie<00:00:48.379> probably<00:00:48.800> a

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
then we would see a movie probably a

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.160 
then we would see a movie probably a
romantic<00:00:49.730> comedy<00:00:49.910> featuring<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.660> talents<00:00:51.079> of

we just stipulate that the date goes
well<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.149> move<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.509> key<00:01:08.660> variable<00:01:09.140> you

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
well and move to the key variable you
