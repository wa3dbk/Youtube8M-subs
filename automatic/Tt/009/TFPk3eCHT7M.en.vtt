when<00:01:44.310> companies<00:01:44.820> include<00:01:45.210> screen<00:01:45.540> shields

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
when companies include screen shields

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
when companies include screen shields
with<00:01:45.960> their<00:01:46.110> cases<00:01:46.439> particularly<00:01:46.770> once<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
with their cases particularly once you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
with their cases particularly once you
hit<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> twenty-five<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.149> thirty<00:01:48.390> dollar

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630

hit the twenty-five to thirty dollar
mark<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:50.070> every<00:01:50.549> case<00:01:50.759> should<00:01:51.479> include<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
mark I think every case should include a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
mark I think every case should include a
screen<00:01:51.899> shield<00:01:52.259> once<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> hit<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> mark

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
screen shield once you hit that mark

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730

there<00:01:53.759> being<00:01:54.060> $35<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.110> should<00:01:55.290> definitely

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
there being $35 one should definitely

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
there being $35 one should definitely
have<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> screen<00:01:56.880> shield<00:01:57.030> included<00:01:57.450> which<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
have a screen shield included which it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.260 
have a screen shield included which it
does<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.740> pretty<00:01:59.009> cool<00:01:59.100> beans<00:01:59.490> take<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
does so that's pretty cool beans take a
look<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> case<00:02:00.899> itself<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.740> see

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
look at the case itself as you can see

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.490 
look at the case itself as you can see
it<00:02:01.979> does<00:02:02.130> look<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.090> alien<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it does look like an alien and what this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.800 
it does look like an alien and what this
one<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> two<00:02:05.250> piece<00:02:05.729> hybrid<00:02:06.509> design

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
one is is a two piece hybrid design

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.139 
one is is a two piece hybrid design
where<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
where you have a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.699 
where you have a
thick<00:02:09.310> tough<00:02:10.310> silicone<00:02:11.090> TPU<00:02:11.599> material<00:02:11.959> not

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
thick tough silicone TPU material not

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.270 
thick tough silicone TPU material not
really<00:02:12.890> silicones<00:02:13.370> more<00:02:13.549> TPU<00:02:14.769> with<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.799> hard

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
really silicones more TPU with a hard

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.990 
really silicones more TPU with a hard
outer<00:02:16.610> shell<00:02:16.959> over<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.140> top<00:02:18.379> so<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.849> put<00:02:19.939> this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
outer shell over the top so to put this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.520 
outer shell over the top so to put this
one<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.239> your<00:02:20.480> phone<00:02:20.629> you're<00:02:20.900> simply<00:02:21.170> going<00:02:21.319> to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
one on your phone you're simply going to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.110 
one on your phone you're simply going to
remove<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.930> hard<00:02:23.930> plastic<00:02:24.470> shell<00:02:24.970> from<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
remove the hard plastic shell from the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.599 
remove the hard plastic shell from the
outside<00:02:26.629> first<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.859> is<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.220> red<00:02:28.519> part<00:02:30.609> just

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
outside first that is this red part just

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.610 
outside first that is this red part just
like<00:02:31.849> so<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.540> then<00:02:32.569> you're<00:02:33.230> left<00:02:33.319> with<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
like so and then you're left with the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.399 
like so and then you're left with the
black<00:02:34.129> inner<00:02:35.090> liner<00:02:35.420> which<00:02:36.049> as<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.379> mentioned

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
black inner liner which as I mentioned

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.759 
black inner liner which as I mentioned
is<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> thicker<00:02:37.540> stiffer<00:02:38.540> TPU<00:02:39.049> material<00:02:39.079> not

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
is a thicker stiffer TPU material not

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.680 
is a thicker stiffer TPU material not
silicone<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.579> it's<00:02:40.819> not<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.269> to<00:02:41.389> attract

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
silicone so it's not going to attract

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.259 
silicone so it's not going to attract
the<00:02:41.840> lint<00:02:42.049> like<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.859> lot<00:02:43.159> of<00:02:43.250> silicone<00:02:43.549> cases<00:02:43.970> do

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
the lint like a lot of silicone cases do

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.930 
the lint like a lot of silicone cases do
i<00:02:44.989> don't<00:02:45.440> i'm<00:02:45.560> not<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.829> big<00:02:46.010> fan<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.280> silicone

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
i don't i'm not a big fan of silicone

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.420 
i don't i'm not a big fan of silicone
cases<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.659> that's<00:02:48.470> good<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.829> doesn't<00:02:49.129> track

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
cases so that's good that doesn't track

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.390 
cases so that's good that doesn't track
Lin<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.120> drives<00:02:50.359> me<00:02:50.510> crazy<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
Lin because that drives me crazy and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
Lin because that drives me crazy and
then<00:02:52.400> simply<00:02:52.700> slip<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.000> top<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.389> first<00:02:53.689> and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
then simply slip the top in first and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.839 
then simply slip the top in first and
then<00:02:54.049> just<00:02:54.170> like<00:02:54.319> any<00:02:54.500> other<00:02:54.590> silicone<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.430> TPU

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
then just like any other silicone or TPU

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.789 
then just like any other silicone or TPU
style<00:02:56.180> case<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.659> pop<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.019> bottom<00:02:57.349> over<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
style case just pop the bottom over and

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.460 
style case just pop the bottom over and
you<00:02:58.639> are<00:02:58.819> good<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.060> go<00:02:59.349> installation<00:03:00.349> is

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
you are good to go installation is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.039 
you are good to go installation is
really<00:03:00.859> quite<00:03:01.129> simple<00:03:01.400> really<00:03:01.989> couldn't<00:03:02.989> be

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
really quite simple really couldn't be

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.470 
really quite simple really couldn't be
too<00:03:03.620> overly<00:03:04.099> complicated<00:03:04.700> here<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> fit<00:03:05.299> is

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
too overly complicated here the fit is

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.379 
too overly complicated here the fit is
great<00:03:05.629> for<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> inner<00:03:06.829> liner<00:03:07.189> there<00:03:07.639> and<00:03:08.150> then

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
great for the inner liner there and then

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.940 
great for the inner liner there and then
you're<00:03:08.510> simply<00:03:08.810> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.079> put<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.409> buttons

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
you're simply going to put the buttons

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.300 
you're simply going to put the buttons
side<00:03:10.220> first<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.959> inner<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:13.069> know<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
side first with the inner you know the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.640 
side first with the inner you know the
outer<00:03:13.790> shell<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.690> then<00:03:15.139> slip<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.590> on

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
outer shell there and then slip that on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.250 
outer shell there and then slip that on
over<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> top<00:03:16.579> pop<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.750> over<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.019> other<00:03:18.109> side

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
over the top pop it over the other side

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.140 
over the top pop it over the other side
and<00:03:18.709> kind<00:03:18.889> of<00:03:18.919> pop<00:03:19.129> it<00:03:19.310> into<00:03:19.459> place<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.090> then

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and kind of pop it into place and then

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.819 
and kind of pop it into place and then
here<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.989> bottom<00:03:21.139> there<00:03:21.440> are<00:03:21.500> two<00:03:21.650> little

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
here on the bottom there are two little

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.550 
here on the bottom there are two little
tabs<00:03:22.069> right<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:22.699> that<00:03:23.209> snap<00:03:23.629> in<00:03:23.870> here<00:03:24.440> on

really really well feels good in your

really really well feels good in your
hand<00:03:36.409> it<00:03:36.560> has<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.709> slightly<00:03:37.069> slippery<00:03:37.639> feel<00:03:37.940> on

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
hand it has a slightly slippery feel on

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.939 
hand it has a slightly slippery feel on
this<00:03:39.729> hard<00:03:40.729> outer<00:03:41.030> plastic<00:03:41.479> part<00:03:41.989> which<00:03:42.709> I

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
this hard outer plastic part which I

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.129 
this hard outer plastic part which I
wasn't<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> huge<00:03:43.459> fan<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.819> but<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.479> black<00:03:44.780> part

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
wasn't a huge fan of but the black part

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.860 
wasn't a huge fan of but the black part
is<00:03:45.290> fairly<00:03:45.620> grippy<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.030> didn't<00:03:47.510> find<00:03:47.720> it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
is fairly grippy so I didn't find it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.199 
is fairly grippy so I didn't find it
slippery<00:03:48.169> in<00:03:48.500> my<00:03:48.799> hand<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.159> didn't<00:03:49.430> drop<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.000> but

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
slippery in my hand I didn't drop it but

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.710 
slippery in my hand I didn't drop it but
this<00:03:50.750> part<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.169> rather<00:03:51.440> smooth<00:03:51.949> though<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:53.540> you

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
this part is rather smooth though as you

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.539 
this part is rather smooth though as you
can<00:03:53.810> see<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.049> also<00:03:54.169> does<00:03:54.379> wear<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.979> little<00:03:55.340> bit

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
can see it also does wear a little bit

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.129 
can see it also does wear a little bit
i'll<00:03:56.090> be<00:03:56.180> using<00:03:56.389> this<00:03:56.569> one<00:03:56.750> pretty<00:03:56.959> much

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
i'll be using this one pretty much

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.699 
i'll be using this one pretty much
exclusively<00:03:57.409> for<00:03:57.949> about<00:03:58.129> a<00:03:58.159> week<00:03:58.370> now<00:03:58.430> and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
exclusively for about a week now and

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.839 
exclusively for about a week now and
fewer<00:04:00.709> was<00:04:00.859> quite<00:04:01.010> taken<00:04:01.190> with<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.519> she<00:04:01.639> really

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
fewer was quite taken with it she really

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.300 
fewer was quite taken with it she really
likes<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.120> alien<00:04:02.479> guy<00:04:02.739> which<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.889> pretty<00:04:04.040> cool

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
likes the alien guy which is pretty cool

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.699 
likes the alien guy which is pretty cool
but<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.239> does<00:04:05.419> kind<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.780> scratch<00:04:06.049> up<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.680> a

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
but it does kind of scratch up here a

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.649 
but it does kind of scratch up here a
little<00:04:06.919> bit<00:04:07.159> on<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.909> back<00:04:08.090> not<00:04:08.449> really

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
little bit on the back not really

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.539 
little bit on the back not really
scratches<00:04:09.199> because<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.739> look<00:04:09.859> at<00:04:10.010> me<00:04:10.370> on

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
scratches because if you look at me on

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.580 
scratches because if you look at me on
the<00:04:10.579> on<00:04:10.909> the<00:04:10.940> right<00:04:11.209> angle<00:04:11.629> you<00:04:12.260> can't<00:04:12.470> even

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
the on the right angle you can't even

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.409 
the on the right angle you can't even
see<00:04:12.859> them<00:04:13.040> when<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.609> light<00:04:13.790> hits<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.209> though

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
see them when the light hits it though

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.939 
see them when the light hits it though
you<00:04:14.690> can<00:04:14.870> see<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:15.229> there's<00:04:15.409> you<00:04:15.530> know<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.650> few

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
you can see that there's you know a few

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.399 
you can see that there's you know a few
scuffs<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.579> it<00:04:16.789> but<00:04:17.299> that's<00:04:17.419> why<00:04:17.659> we<00:04:17.810> buy<00:04:17.959> cases

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
scuffs on it but that's why we buy cases

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.779 
scuffs on it but that's why we buy cases
anyway<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.769> keep<00:04:18.950> our<00:04:19.099> phones<00:04:19.340> from<00:04:19.549> getting

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
anyway to keep our phones from getting

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.440 
anyway to keep our phones from getting
scratched<00:04:19.940> up

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
scratched up

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.390 
scratched up
so<00:04:20.570> if<00:04:21.020> a<00:04:21.170> case<00:04:21.350> scratches<00:04:21.830> up<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.040> little<00:04:22.280> bit

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so if a case scratches up a little bit

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.310 
so if a case scratches up a little bit
it's<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.120> not<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> big<00:04:23.450> deal<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.200> you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
it's really not a big deal and you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.960 
it's really not a big deal and you
really<00:04:24.560> can't<00:04:24.740> tell<00:04:24.800> on<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.280> one<00:04:25.490> unless<00:04:25.850> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
really can't tell on this one unless the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.120 
really can't tell on this one unless the
light<00:04:26.150> hits<00:04:26.390> it<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.380> right<00:04:27.410> place<00:04:27.590> so

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
light hits it in just the right place so

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.070 
light hits it in just the right place so
that's<00:04:28.580> not<00:04:28.790> really<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> big<00:04:29.210> deal<00:04:29.240> let's<00:04:29.990> move

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
that's not really a big deal let's move

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.260 
that's not really a big deal let's move
up<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.470> top<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.040> take<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> look<00:04:31.550> at<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.970> cut

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
up to the top and take a look at the cut

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.060 
up to the top and take a look at the cut
outs<00:04:32.510> here<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.320> have<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.650> headphone<00:04:34.040> jack

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
outs here you have the headphone jack

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.300 
outs here you have the headphone jack
cut<00:04:34.700> out<00:04:34.880> nice<00:04:35.270> good<00:04:35.540> size<00:04:35.840> cutout<00:04:36.200> no<00:04:36.890> problem

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
cut out nice good size cutout no problem

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.950 
cut out nice good size cutout no problem
there<00:04:37.520> most<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.150> your<00:04:38.270> headphones<00:04:38.690> should

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
there most of your headphones should

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.320 
there most of your headphones should
work<00:04:39.140> just<00:04:39.380> fine<00:04:39.920> including<00:04:40.820> some<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.180> your

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
work just fine including some of your

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.540 
work just fine including some of your
oversized<00:04:41.720> DJ<00:04:42.080> headphones<00:04:42.470> should<00:04:43.190> also<00:04:43.310> be

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
oversized DJ headphones should also be

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.270 
oversized DJ headphones should also be
just<00:04:43.790> fine<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.390> is<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.540> little<00:04:44.690> bit<00:04:44.840> recessed

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
just fine it is a little bit recessed

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.160 
just fine it is a little bit recessed
but<00:04:46.280> most<00:04:46.700> jacks<00:04:47.090> accommodate<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:47.870> now

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
but most jacks accommodate for that now

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.640 
but most jacks accommodate for that now
you<00:04:48.410> know<00:04:49.280> now<00:04:49.850> we're<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.480> almost<00:04:51.290> mobile

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
you know now we're in the almost mobile

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.620 
you know now we're in the almost mobile
device<00:04:51.890> Jack's<00:04:52.220> will<00:04:52.880> compensate<00:04:53.240> for<00:04:53.600> that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
device Jack's will compensate for that

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.260 
device Jack's will compensate for that
just<00:04:53.960> fine<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:54.560> shouldn't<00:04:55.400> really<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.610> much<00:04:56.240> of

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
just fine so shouldn't really be much of

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.480 
just fine so shouldn't really be much of
an<00:04:56.540> issue<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.230> sleep/wake<00:04:57.650> button<00:04:57.680> is<00:04:58.130> very

an issue the sleep/wake button is very

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.790 
an issue the sleep/wake button is very
responsive<00:04:59.150> which<00:04:59.630> is<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.840> big<00:05:00.080> plus<00:05:00.230> for<00:05:00.350> me<00:05:00.590> I

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
responsive which is a big plus for me I

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.350 
responsive which is a big plus for me I
don't<00:05:01.100> like<00:05:01.250> it<00:05:01.400> when<00:05:01.430> sleep-wake<00:05:02.030> buttons

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
don't like it when sleep-wake buttons

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.760 
don't like it when sleep-wake buttons
are<00:05:02.510> hard<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.840> press<00:05:02.990> or<00:05:03.200> I<00:05:03.230> can't<00:05:03.470> feel<00:05:03.560> myself

are hard to press or I can't feel myself
pressing<00:05:04.340> them<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:05.000> kind<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.240> thing<00:05:05.420> I<00:05:05.510> like

a nice responsive sleep/wake button and
that's<00:05:08.510> exactly<00:05:08.690> what<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.200> one<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.440> moving

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
that's exactly what this one is moving

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.670 
that's exactly what this one is moving
over<00:05:10.640> here<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> cutouts<00:05:11.480> on<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.990> side<00:05:12.260> as
