00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
out of it because I just really

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.650 
out of it because I just really
this<00:04:31.099> kind<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.340> takes<00:04:31.550> me<00:04:31.789> back<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.030> when<00:04:32.449> you

much width off the Ramones but hey they
I<00:05:57.560> said<00:05:57.949> that's<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.430> way<00:05:58.580> Britain<00:05:58.909> had<00:05:59.060> it

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
I said that's the way Britain had it

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.420 
I said that's the way Britain had it
here<00:05:59.330> my<00:05:59.539> guess<00:05:59.599> or<00:06:00.530> you<00:06:00.800> know<00:06:00.919> listen<00:06:01.219> to<00:06:01.340> the

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
here my guess or you know listen to the

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.909 
here my guess or you know listen to the
punk<00:06:01.669> rock<00:06:02.050> wave<00:06:03.050> that<00:06:03.319> was<00:06:03.440> coming<00:06:03.770> across

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
punk rock wave that was coming across

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.709 
punk rock wave that was coming across
then<00:06:04.340> that's<00:06:04.580> I<00:06:04.729> guess<00:06:04.789> that's<00:06:05.150> what<00:06:05.360> they<00:06:05.569> had

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
then that's I guess that's what they had

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.300 
then that's I guess that's what they had
to<00:06:05.840> do<00:06:05.990> but<00:06:06.889> anyway<00:06:07.219> then<00:06:07.580> got<00:06:08.449> Fleetwood<00:06:08.870> Mac

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
to do but anyway then got Fleetwood Mac

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.800 
to do but anyway then got Fleetwood Mac
of<00:06:10.310> course<00:06:10.370> this<00:06:10.729> is<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.909> later<00:06:11.180> Fleetwood<00:06:11.630> Mac

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810
