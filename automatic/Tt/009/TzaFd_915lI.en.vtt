00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 good morning micetti welcome to a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.310
 new episode of the top five dei 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.350
 today's topic and book shop ie 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.210
 there were literary habits today 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 light of the madonna anyway bookies 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.450
 is the breadth means habits 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 literary and therefore in theory will have to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 show you 5 of my habits 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180
 literary and I must admit that it was 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
 particularly difficult because I have it 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.000
 many and I love to talk about these 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 things I limited to those that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 you probably still haven't guessed 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.769
 then the number one is that before 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 buy a book 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.570
 I read the first paragraph the last word 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.369
 and then the age-old are a sniffed ice 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 compulsive of books I am very sure of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.300
 don't be the only one but maybe I'm one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 of the few that read the last word 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.110
 without, however , actually becoming a spoiler 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.550
 I'm not afraid of spoiler spoiler 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.200
 in fact, it doesn't bother me a lot 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.789
 I am willingly going to look for it 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 because I'm too curious and can't 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 to wait until the end and then never 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 read the first paragraph I think it is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 very normal indeed it seems strange that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 somebody does not, in fact, great 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.390
 part of the ciofeche I caught 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 they arrived because I took the book a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 closed envelope without reading the first one 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.210
 first paragraph without the gev incipit la 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.949
 my second habit is that the frame is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.530
 when I finish reading a book I go 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.049
 always always always reading the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 reviews however not on some social 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.159
 type nobbio guthrie I go on blogspot 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 blogspot is a platform that I love 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.299
 though not part of it because maybe ve 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.409
 I told you that I had started a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 make a blog 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.340
 but then let it go because I do n't know 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.710
 advertising me doesn't know how to let me know 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 and I repeat what you probably do 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.150
 code said I have no idea how 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.159
 you have arrived here in short, blasco a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.920
 who really like graphics like 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 site settings in general 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.590
 hardly a person who has a blog 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 spot me unpleasant and therefore every 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920
 time I finish book done up 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.049
 blogspot on my favorite blogs if 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.030
 you want then maybe I do a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.780
 video just for this reason why not I have 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 quite 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.560
 I go to my favorite literary blogs and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.840
 I'm looking for reviews of the book I have 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.369
 just read and I swear the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.010
 reviews that I find on blogspot 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.480
 although I have to admit that occasionally 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.540
 ciofeche sales have also occurred a 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.260
 me number 3 abandoned the league that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.700
 I do not like them 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.230
 talking to the fungi in his group if you 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 you want to write it you find below mi 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.860
 I realized that many are feeling 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.320
 as guilty 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.150
 in finishing the books I am not a part of 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.220
 that category I have no 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.990
 regret if I don't like a book 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420
 I close even after five pages not me 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.550
 cares absolutely nothing because the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.770
 my main thought is that life is 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.300
 too short to read all the books 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.100
 that there are the world so why 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.080
 I should waste time with a book that 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820
 I don't like it when I can reread a 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
 book I like or look for a new one 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.350
 done number 4 I use anything like 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.180
 unfortunately, I don't have you 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.570
 my bookmarks my mother had them for me 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.600
 bought three but I lost and my father me 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.440
 he had given them three more but I got them 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.670
 lost 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.930
 so I use as a bookmark 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.020
 literally everything that happens to me 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.750
 under the nose from cellphone to ipod to 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.310
 teaspoon of yogurt made number 5 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.170
 I photograph the phrases I like 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.060
 I have always had a love relationship 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.250
 hate with quotations from gods 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.900
 books because when I read maybe while 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.209
 i'm reading i think of my god this 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.580
 paragraph is wonderful but I don't have 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.560
 want to rewrite it because 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.010
 of course you will know perfectly 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.989
 that I am opposed to dirtying the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.250
 book to dirty the book and any 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.170
 so that it is underlined 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.769
 pencil or with the post it then leaves 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 all the glue can not physically 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.110
 to do it on the book and therefore I need to 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.180
 I do not have the time to copy the sentence 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.860
 to copy the sentence because I don't have the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.330
 physical time to copy because we have 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.650
 go on reading and I had tried 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.000
 to use made bookmarks 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.500
 simply paper to be able to 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.250
 write over the pages with sentences 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.170
 but I liked those too, though 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.000
 and so I solved it by always keeping her 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.890
 counts at your fingertips and simply 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.480
 photographing the phrases I like 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.440
 the sheet that does not photograph the title 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.720
 of the book then or the ipod full of sentences 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.580
 wonderful but of some I don't remember the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.100
 this is my top five from 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.870
 literary habit if you want 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.250
 for other companies, apple trees but now it's the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.870
 your moment because I am 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.020
 very curious to know yours then 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.970
 if you want to register in the 5 or one or two or 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.800
 20 everything you want I read to you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.000
 always very happy and thanks for 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.000
 me roped steel kittens
