their population began to rise as well

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.759 
their population began to rise as well
partly<00:02:53.360> also<00:02:53.540> because<00:02:53.780> there<00:02:54.530> were<00:02:54.620> more

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
partly also because there were more

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.770 
partly also because there were more

the<00:03:11.459> behavior<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.750> rivers<00:03:14.030> they<00:03:15.030> began<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the behavior of the rivers they began to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.229 
the behavior of the rivers they began to
meander<00:03:16.080> less<00:03:16.260> there<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.739> less<00:03:17.040> erosion<00:03:17.819> that

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
meander less there is less erosion that

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.080 
meander less there is less erosion that
channels<00:03:18.750> narrowed<00:03:19.349> more<00:03:19.709> pools<00:03:20.069> formed<00:03:20.700> more

in<00:03:26.310> response<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.569> wolves<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.920> reason

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
in response to the wolves and the reason

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.080 
in response to the wolves and the reason
was<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.940> regenerating<00:03:30.739> forests

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
was that the regenerating forests

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.610 
was that the regenerating forests
stabilized<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.360> banks<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.349> that<00:03:34.500> they

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
stabilized the banks so that they

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.410 
stabilized the banks so that they
collapse<00:03:35.010> less<00:03:35.310> often<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.150> rivers

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
collapse less often so that the rivers

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.920 
collapse less often so that the rivers
became<00:03:36.930> more<00:03:37.170> fixed<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.769> their<00:03:37.980> course

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
became more fixed in their course

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.930 
became more fixed in their course
similarly<00:03:39.930> by<00:03:40.590> driving<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.519> deer<00:03:41.730> out<00:03:41.910> of

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
similarly by driving the deer out of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.789 
similarly by driving the deer out of
some<00:03:42.239> places<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.319> vegetation

recovering on the valley sides there is

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.860 
recovering on the valley sides there is
a<00:03:46.829> soil<00:03:47.190> erosion<00:03:47.579> because<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> vegetation

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
a soil erosion because the vegetation

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.430 
a soil erosion because the vegetation
stabilized<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.069> as<00:03:50.310> well<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.200> Wolves

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
stabilized that as well so the Wolves

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.300
