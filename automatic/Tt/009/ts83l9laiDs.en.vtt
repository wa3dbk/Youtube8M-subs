00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.450
 again first that nothing is a company 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.780
 familiar the story starts with me 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.760
 grandfather in the 40s when he arrives 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.890
 of Europe 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.080
 jb currently has a mix between 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.470
 national products and products 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 imported in reality the challenge that the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.690
 that we have had and that has marked a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.790
 little always our 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.700
 our work has been enthusiasm 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.250
 by design we actually have a 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.950
 very important team at what level 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.870
 they are human resources both in the area of 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.480
 production as in the design area and 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.520
 customer service the area of 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.850
 design department is a bit the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.930
 start engine of the solutions of 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.940
 interior design that we want 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.390
 provide the client in need 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.370
 mine to try to capture the intent 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.829
 of the client sometimes intentions that are 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.350
 this 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.969
 very significant spiritual that you 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.769
 bring back memories that are part of the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.809
 way to do either client in a 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.809
 company either the client this 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.950
 for a house either for a trade the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.630
 greatest pleasure of all is when all the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.090
 process and the production chain are 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.100
 ends and we see that we really achieve 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.840
 what we really wanted that was the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.000
 happiness in all its aspects of 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.299
 Clients in all needs 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.920
 covered and in all expectations 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.810
 they had trained for 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.520
 inner space solution seems to me 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.789
 fun that is always something different 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.399
 that is, we are not doing something that is 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.800
 standard or that you always have the same 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.810
 recipe let's say if we know the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.369
 processes there is always a variation 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.580
 depending on the client and the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.369
 situations in the design process in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.409
 here at once it always starts with a 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.420
 interview in client either in the place 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.990
 of work in your field 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.659
 of housing 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.570
 always starts in those places where 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's intervene we sit down we see 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.280
 colors of the textures 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.750
 from determinations everything to get to 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 a meeting room interviewed 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.560
 him and see what he thinks it is 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 what this was really accomplished in that is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.910
 blueprint for a way this 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.920
 called obviously on the second leg 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.470
 our important is the factory without 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.200
 they we can not develop 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.100
 all that we do on paper 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.460
 our work do jb we are in the 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.820

 pretty of the company as the puntillazo 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.830
