car this is a very very good card it
actually<00:00:27.689> does<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> little<00:00:28.859> better<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.340> few

that<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.739> giant<00:00:41.129> card<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.730> card<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> 512

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that that giant card this card has a 512

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
that that giant card this card has a 512
bit<00:00:43.020> memory<00:00:43.530> interface<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> has<00:00:44.430> 512

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
bit memory interface and it has 512

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
bit memory interface and it has 512
megabytes<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> memory<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.680> memory<00:00:46.739> runs

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
megabytes of memory and that memory runs

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
megabytes of memory and that memory runs
at<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.210> point<00:00:48.420> six<00:00:48.750> five<00:00:48.960> gigahertz<00:00:49.379> its

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
at one point six five gigahertz its

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.600 
at one point six five gigahertz its
gddr3<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.809> gonna<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.140> extremely<00:00:53.100> fast<00:00:53.309> as

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
gddr3 so it's gonna be extremely fast as

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
gddr3 so it's gonna be extremely fast as
you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.059> gonna<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.840> texture

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you know it's gonna get a lot of texture

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
you know it's gonna get a lot of texture
in<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.210> standpoint<00:00:57.510> it's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
in and out so from that standpoint it's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
in and out so from that standpoint it's
very<00:00:58.050> fast<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:59.430> has<00:01:00.469> 320<00:01:01.469> stream

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
very fast also this has 320 stream

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
very fast also this has 320 stream
processors<00:01:02.399> let's<00:01:02.609> talk<00:01:02.850> about<00:01:02.969> stream

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
processors let's talk about stream

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
processors let's talk about stream

processors now with DirectX 10 they use

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.960 
processors now with DirectX 10 they use
stream<00:01:06.540> processors<00:01:07.080> instead<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> know

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
stream processors instead of you know

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for you know for for the lighting and a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
for you know for for the lighting and a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
processor for the particle effects well

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
processor for the particle effects well
this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> 320<00:01:16.110> stream<00:01:16.409> processors

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
this one there is 320 stream processors

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
this one there is 320 stream processors
and<00:01:17.130> each<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> those<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:17.909> allocated

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and each one of those can be allocated

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.179 
and each one of those can be allocated
to<00:01:18.659> anything<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to anything so you're not gonna be

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
to anything so you're not gonna be
wasting<00:01:20.759> any<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.360> speed<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.990> there's<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
wasting any of the speed if there's a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.050 
wasting any of the speed if there's a
lot<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> geometry<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> screen<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.880> there's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
lot of geometry on the screen if there's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
lot of geometry on the screen if there's
a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> particle<00:01:24.750> effects<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.590> know

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
a lot of particle effects well you know

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
a lot of particle effects well you know
they<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.979> assign<00:01:26.220> more<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:26.729> processors

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they can assign more of those processors

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
they can assign more of those processors
to<00:01:27.720> handle<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.100> know

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to handle that so you get you know

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940 
to handle that so you get you know
maximum<00:01:29.700> functionality<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.930> any<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.680> given

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
maximum functionality at any one given

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
maximum functionality at any one given
time<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:32.970> far<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> benchmarks<00:01:33.810> go

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
time now as far as the benchmarks go

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
time now as far as the benchmarks go
this<00:01:34.799> one<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.400> runs<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.210> well

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this one actually runs very very well

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
this one actually runs very very well
when<00:01:37.049> compared<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> 8800<00:01:38.220> GTS<00:01:38.759> models

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
when compared with the 8800 GTS models

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
when compared with the 8800 GTS models
even<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> top-of-the-line<00:01:39.960> 8800<00:01:40.680> GT<00:01:40.710> s<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
even the top-of-the-line 8800 GT s and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.510 
even the top-of-the-line 8800 GT s and
this<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.390> actually<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.840> superior<00:01:43.740> scaling

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
this one actually has superior scaling

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
this one actually has superior scaling
so<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> run<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
so when you run two of these in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.319 
so when you run two of these in
crossfire<00:01:46.549> they<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:47.970> gonna<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
crossfire they are actually gonna do a

this one now this one has you know
standard<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.420> DVI<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.440> run<00:02:46.620> dual

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
standard to DVI so you can run dual

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.770 
standard to DVI so you can run dual
monitors<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.730> listen<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:48.660> you're

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
monitors and listen to this when you're

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120 
monitors and listen to this when you're
running<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.140> monitor<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.710> maximum

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
running one monitor the maximum

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
running one monitor the maximum
resolution<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.730> can<00:02:50.850> run<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.090> 38<00:02:51.570> 40<00:02:52.020> by

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
resolution that you can run is 38 40 by

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.740 
resolution that you can run is 38 40 by
24<00:02:53.010> hundred<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.390> that's<00:02:54.630> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
24 hundred and that's just that's just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.580 
24 hundred and that's just that's just
ridiculous

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
ridiculous

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.230
