00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
incredibly light also our bed is six

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.789 
incredibly light also our bed is six
inches<00:03:26.850> higher<00:03:27.660> than<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.989> competition<00:03:28.170> so

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
inches higher than the competition so

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.800 
inches higher than the competition so
you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.489> put<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> lot<00:03:29.880> more<00:03:30.000> payload<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.600> here

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
you can put a lot more payload in here

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.470 
you can put a lot more payload in here
and<00:03:31.019> they<00:03:31.799> uh<00:03:31.829> I<00:03:32.310> think<00:03:32.820> that's<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.239> it's<00:03:33.390> just

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
and they uh I think that's it it's just

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.220 
and they uh I think that's it it's just
comment<00:03:34.170> for<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:35.070> also<00:03:35.420> come<00:03:36.420> over<00:03:36.959> here

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
comment for that and also come over here

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.780 
comment for that and also come over here
if<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.250> look<00:03:38.370> at<00:03:38.489> this

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
if you look at this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.970 
if you look at this
question<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.239> here<00:03:39.450> these<00:03:40.049> leaf<00:03:40.349> springs<00:03:40.709> are

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
question in here these leaf springs are

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.750 
question in here these leaf springs are
three<00:03:41.489> inches<00:03:41.790> thick<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:44.609> is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
three inches thick they are the that is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.699 
three inches thick they are the that is
that<00:03:44.969> is<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.450> largest<00:03:45.750> there's<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.409> lead<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
that is the largest there's the lead the

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.610 
that is the largest there's the lead the
closest<00:03:47.040> competitions<00:03:47.579> two<00:03:47.790> inches<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.870> also

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
closest competitions two inches so also

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.550 
closest competitions two inches so also
if<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.159> look<00:03:50.340> here<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.760> get<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:50.969> side<00:03:51.239> bolt

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
if you look here you get the side bolt

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.899 
if you look here you get the side bolt
they<00:03:53.090> under<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.180> shocks<00:03:54.989> here<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.409> on<00:03:56.400> most

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
they under the shocks here and on most

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.270 
they under the shocks here and on most
trucks<00:03:57.239> they<00:03:57.689> got<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> top<00:03:58.230> bolt<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:59.099> top

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
trucks they got the top bolt and the top

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.559 
trucks they got the top bolt and the top
bolt<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.609> one<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.909> first<00:04:00.090> things<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.480> go

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
bolt is one of the first things to go

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.599 
bolt is one of the first things to go
out<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:00.959> suspension<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.099> far<00:04:02.310> since<00:04:02.459> it

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
out on suspension and so far since it

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.860 
out on suspension and so far since it
did<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:02.819> they<00:04:02.970> put<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> reinforced<00:04:03.659> bolt

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
did they they put a reinforced bolt

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.390 
did they they put a reinforced bolt
through<00:04:04.049> there<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.409> have<00:04:04.769> not<00:04:04.920> even<00:04:05.040> heard<00:04:05.280> of

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
through there I have not even heard of

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.179 
through there I have not even heard of
it<00:04:05.519> Abigail<00:04:06.120> going<00:04:06.450> out<00:04:06.569> also<00:04:07.319> with<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> f-150

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
it Abigail going out also with the f-150

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.039 
it Abigail going out also with the f-150
s<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.340> can't<00:04:08.579> really<00:04:08.700> see<00:04:08.790> from<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.329> but

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
s you can't really see from here but

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.629 
s you can't really see from here but
that<00:04:10.200> frame<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.709> there<00:04:10.829> it's<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.159> full<00:04:11.400> box

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
that frame in there it's a full box

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.940 
that frame in there it's a full box
reinforced<00:04:12.329> frame<00:04:12.569> so<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.319> is<00:04:13.349> strongest

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
reinforced frame so this is strongest

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.069 
reinforced frame so this is strongest
rain<00:04:14.159> on<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.370> market<00:04:14.700> also<00:04:15.540> there's<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.989> I
