Scott I did all right tell me a little
bit<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.280> guess<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.820> your<00:00:14.940> flagship

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
bit about I guess this is your flagship

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.420 
bit about I guess this is your flagship
yeah<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.379> our<00:00:16.500> flagship<00:00:16.920> board<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.369> is

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
yeah this is our flagship board this is

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.880 
yeah this is our flagship board this is
the<00:00:17.550> board<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.910> guess<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.570> mainly<00:00:18.900> you

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the board I guess that we mainly you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.230 
the board I guess that we mainly you
know<00:00:19.920> draws<00:00:20.220> all<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.490> our<00:00:20.609> customers<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.210> our

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
know draws all of our customers to our

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.689 
know draws all of our customers to our
company<00:00:21.740> basically<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.250> deal<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.550> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
company basically the deal with this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
company basically the deal with this
board<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.380> crossover

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
board is that it it's a crossover

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.550 
board is that it it's a crossover
between<00:00:26.240> su<00:00:27.240> P<00:00:27.510> world<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> fishing<00:00:28.380> world

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
between su P world in the fishing world

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
between su P world in the fishing world
this<00:00:29.250> board<00:00:29.490> functions<00:00:29.699> basically<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this board functions basically as a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
this board functions basically as a
stand-up<00:00:31.439> fishing<00:00:31.859> paddle<00:00:32.430> board<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.000> you

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
stand-up fishing paddle board but you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
stand-up fishing paddle board but you
can<00:00:33.210> also<00:00:33.329> take<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> gear<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
can also take all the gear off of it and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
can also take all the gear off of it and
it's<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.219> regular<00:00:35.489> su<00:00:35.730> P<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.840> draw<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it's your regular su P so the draw to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
it's your regular su P so the draw to
this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.710> there's<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.070> no<00:00:38.309> set<00:00:38.550> back

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this is that there's really no set back

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000 
this is that there's really no set back
you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> use<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.750> SUV<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.649> fishing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you can use it as an SUV or a fishing

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.299 
you can use it as an SUV or a fishing
machine

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
machine

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
machine
so<00:00:41.640> well<00:00:41.940> why<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> walk<00:00:42.390> us<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.840> guess

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so well why don't you walk us I guess

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
so well why don't you walk us I guess
about<00:00:43.379> us<00:00:43.559> Turner<00:00:43.770> okay<00:00:44.670> say<00:00:44.820> oh<00:00:44.850> okay<00:00:45.510> well<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
about us Turner okay say oh okay well we

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
about us Turner okay say oh okay well we
can<00:00:46.079> start<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.850> our<00:00:47.850> board<00:00:48.120> design<00:00:48.420> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
can start up here our board design it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
can start up here our board design it's
a<00:00:49.350> twelve<00:00:49.530> foot<00:00:49.590> board<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> 32

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
a twelve foot board and this is a 32

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360 
a twelve foot board and this is a 32
inch<00:00:50.910> wide<00:00:51.149> board<00:00:51.469> it's<00:00:52.469> also<00:00:52.590> 5<00:00:52.890> inches<00:00:53.129> thick

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
inch wide board it's also 5 inches thick

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.529 
inch wide board it's also 5 inches thick
which<00:00:53.550> adds<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> lot<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> buoyancy<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
which adds a lot of buoyancy to the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
which adds a lot of buoyancy to the
board<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.079> through<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.370> much

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
board you can see through here how much

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
board you can see through here how much
thicker<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> regular<00:00:57.570> su<00:00:57.930> P<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
thicker it is in a regular su P and this

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.430 
thicker it is in a regular su P and this
also<00:00:59.430> gives<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> buoyancy<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> water<00:01:00.600> our

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
also gives you buoyancy in the water our

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
also gives you buoyancy in the water our
nose<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> taper<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> front<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.359> decrease

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
nose is a taper to a front to decrease

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.479 
nose is a taper to a front to decrease
noise<00:01:04.439> slap<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> through<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
noise slap when it's going through the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
noise slap when it's going through the
water<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> board<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.650> first

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
water as we go up the board the first

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.830 
water as we go up the board the first
thing<00:01:08.040> you'll<00:01:08.159> notice<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.549> our<00:01:08.909> deck<00:01:09.090> pad<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
thing you'll notice is our deck pad we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
thing you'll notice is our deck pad we
use<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.500> product<00:01:10.860> called<00:01:11.010> C<00:01:11.310> deck<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.299> an
