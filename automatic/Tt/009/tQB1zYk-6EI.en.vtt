boat is one of life's great gifts and
the<00:00:11.730> only<00:00:12.240> challenge<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.960> once<00:00:13.349> you're

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
the only challenge is that once you're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it's hard to get around because you

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.960 
it's hard to get around because you
can't<00:00:16.859> take<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.190> car<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
certainly renting a car is an option but

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
bit more sustainable option and that's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.220

alloy<00:01:28.729> components<00:01:29.729> meaning<00:01:29.880> aluminum<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
alloy components meaning aluminum so the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.859 
alloy components meaning aluminum so the
handlebars<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> rims<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> stem<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
handlebars and the rims and the stem and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
handlebars and the rims and the stem and
and<00:01:34.020> virtually<00:01:34.770> every<00:01:35.100> component<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and virtually every component on this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.920 
and virtually every component on this
bike<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.299> aluminum

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
bike is aluminum

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.179 
bike is aluminum
now<00:01:37.049> aluminum<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.560> great<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.009> it's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
now aluminum is great because it's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.429 
now aluminum is great because it's
strong<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.210> light<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> main<00:01:40.170> thing<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
strong it's light but the main thing is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
strong it's light but the main thing is
that<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.860> doesn't<00:01:41.159> rust<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.030> you're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that it doesn't rust and so if you're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.030 
that it doesn't rust and so if you're
storing<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> boat<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
storing this on a boat that's on the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.100 
storing this on a boat that's on the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it first and to do that you have to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.389 
it first and to do that you have to
loosen<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> brakes<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.200> pop<00:02:07.920> off<00:02:08.190> the

break any tubes in the process so you

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.910 
break any tubes in the process so you
