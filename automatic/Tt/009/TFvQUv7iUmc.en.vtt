00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.600
 years and they did not get anything until their 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:04.689
 golden age in 1980 but this resurfaced 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.680
 supposed curse with its descent 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.050
 number 7 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.320
 the haiti selection played its only 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.210
 World in Germany-1974 in its 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 delegation there was a sorcerer which 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.770
 I helped before the game against Poland 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.410
 the sorcerer did his work in a goal 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.780
 the match ended in favor of poland 7 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.050
 to 0 apparently it was wrong of goal 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.030
 number 6 no selection in the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.190
 history that has been champion of the cup 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.080
 confederations could have been champion 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.250
 of the world although last year it was 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.670
 brazil champion 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.899
 we can see if this curse is broken 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.910
 number 5 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.860
 supposedly independent fans 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.840
 of avellaneda buried seven cats 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.550
 killed in the racing goal which 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.100
 he came from being a tournament champion 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.360
 Argentine the liberators and a cup 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.460
 intercontinental in 1967 after this 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 racing did not have great achievements 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.130
 this is why six of the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.580
 seven cats the team went to the descent in 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.850

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.430
 two champions 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.040
 the 87 and the 2004 the benfica from 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.650

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.540
 Aaron Ramsey Arsenal Player Every 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940

 whitney houston number 2 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.480
 no soccer player awarded with the ball 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.510
 of gold a year before a world cup has 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.739
 managed to be crowned as world champion 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.319
 this has happened to many players 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.599
 among which stand out lionel 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.640

 lost to Brazil the final against 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.540
 France number 1 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.670
 in my opinion it is the most important and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.560
 that has always happened whenever a 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.330
 player plays the cup of the champions 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.940

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.880
 time winning 3 to 0 the liverpool tied
