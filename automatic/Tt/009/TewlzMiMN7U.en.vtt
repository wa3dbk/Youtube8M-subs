00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
to show you how to make two different

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.110 
to show you how to make two different
styles<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.579> one<00:00:40.940> is<00:00:41.410> going<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.590> be<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:43.190> loop<00:00:43.910> on

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
styles this one is going to be a loop on

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.569 
styles this one is going to be a loop on
top<00:00:44.420> without<00:00:44.750> wire<00:00:45.290> wrapping<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.160> other<00:00:46.340> one

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
top without wire wrapping the other one

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.920 
top without wire wrapping the other one
that<00:00:46.730> I'm<00:00:46.820> going<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.059> show<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:47.300> how<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.629> make

that I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.740 
that I'm going to show you how to make
in<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.289> minute<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.770> going<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.460> be<00:00:49.700> with<00:00:50.420> wire

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
in a minute is going to be with wire

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.160 
in a minute is going to be with wire
wrapping<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.090> there's<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.180> lot<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.420> variation

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
wrapping so there's a lot of variation

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.500 
wrapping so there's a lot of variation
that<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.590> can<00:00:54.860> come<00:00:55.280> up<00:00:55.489> with<00:00:55.760> with<00:00:56.059> earrings

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's the combination of the beads the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.610 
it's the combination of the beads the
wire<00:00:58.940> wrapping<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.629> findings<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.410> use

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
wire wrapping the findings that you use

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.529 
wire wrapping the findings that you use
the<00:01:00.829> head<00:01:01.010> pins<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.640> use<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:02.210> forth

the head pins that you use and so forth

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.229 
the head pins that you use and so forth
is<00:01:02.719> what<00:01:03.440> will<00:01:03.620> make<00:01:03.649> these<00:01:04.250> beads<00:01:04.640> truly

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
is what will make these beads truly

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.719 
is what will make these beads truly
unique<00:01:05.570> but<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.380> wanted<00:01:06.649> to<00:01:06.800> share<00:01:07.039> in

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
round bead on then what I'm going to do

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.570 
round bead on then what I'm going to do
is<00:02:23.349> I'm<00:02:24.349> going<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> take<00:02:24.620> my<00:02:24.950> flat<00:02:25.340> nose<00:02:25.550> pliers

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
is I'm going to take my flat nose pliers

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.820 
is I'm going to take my flat nose pliers
and<00:02:26.709> I'm<00:02:27.709> going<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.099> bend<00:02:28.840> right<00:02:29.840> at<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.560> top

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and I'm going to bend right at the top

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.090 
and I'm going to bend right at the top
of<00:02:31.160> this<00:02:31.959> silver<00:02:32.959> bead<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:34.069> a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
of this silver bead I'm going to make a

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
of this silver bead I'm going to make a
nice<00:02:34.910> 90<00:02:35.510> degree<00:02:36.100> angle<00:02:37.100> bed<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.730> can<00:02:37.819> see

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
nice 90 degree angle bed so you can see

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440 
nice 90 degree angle bed so you can see
it's<00:02:38.239> right<00:02:38.540> flush<00:02:38.930> with<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.440> bead<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.069> then

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
it's right flush with that bead and then

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.300 
it's right flush with that bead and then
I'm<00:02:41.450> going<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.630> take<00:02:41.870> my<00:02:42.080> round<00:02:42.410> nose<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.040> this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
I'm going to take my round nose and this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.970 
I'm going to take my round nose and this
pair<00:02:43.580> happens<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.330> kind<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.900> a<00:02:45.050> stubby

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280 
cutters and this is a nice i like this
pair<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.970> allows<00:03:35.299> me<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.660> get<00:03:35.840> really

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
you're doing this because these pieces

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.680 
you're doing this because these pieces
do<00:03:58.940> sometimes<00:03:59.540> fly<00:03:59.900> around<00:04:00.079> ok<00:04:01.090> now<00:04:02.090> I've<00:04:02.390> got

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
close this I'm going to take my flat

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.319 
close this I'm going to take my flat
nose<00:04:08.510> again<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.140> I'm<00:04:09.829> going<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.160> work<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.060> so

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
nose again and I'm going to work it so

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.759 
nose again and I'm going to work it so
that<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.690> ends<00:04:12.500> up<00:04:12.819> flush<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.410> makes<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.560> nice

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
that it ends up flush and makes a nice

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.000 
that it ends up flush and makes a nice

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
loop here and if you work it back and

loop here and if you work it back and
forth<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.459> little<00:04:19.609> bit<00:04:19.760> that's<00:04:20.090> going<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.389> work

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
forth a little bit that's going to work

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.580 
forth a little bit that's going to work
hard<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.650> silver<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:23.120> metal<00:04:23.539> so<00:04:24.320> that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
hard in the silver the the metal so that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.339 
hard in the silver the the metal so that
it<00:04:25.340> stays<00:04:25.700> closed<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.479> it<00:04:26.630> doesn't<00:04:26.960> fall<00:04:27.320> off

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
it stays closed and it doesn't fall off

you're finding ok so I have finished

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.200 
you're finding ok so I have finished
that<00:04:32.479> loop<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.229> now<00:04:34.189> what<00:04:34.370> I'm<00:04:34.490> going<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.819> do

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
that loop and now what I'm going to do

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.450 
that loop and now what I'm going to do
is<00:04:36.909> get<00:04:37.909> my<00:04:38.409> finding<00:04:39.409> and<00:04:39.879> I'm<00:04:40.879> going<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.090> use<00:04:41.419> a
