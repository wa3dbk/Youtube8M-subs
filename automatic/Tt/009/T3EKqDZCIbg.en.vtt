then<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> diaphragm<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:52.950> move<00:01:53.130> back<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
then the diaphragm will move back and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
then the diaphragm will move back and
forth<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:55.110> sequential<00:01:55.530> movements

very<00:02:02.520> distinctive<00:02:03.000> super<00:02:03.719> sequential<00:02:04.079> blow

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
very distinctive super sequential blow

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
very distinctive super sequential blow
off<00:02:04.500> valve<00:02:04.740> sound<00:02:05.070> very<00:02:05.670> attractive<00:02:06.149> sound<00:02:06.420> of

off valve sound very attractive sound of
these<00:02:06.750> super<00:02:07.020> sequential<00:02:07.380> law<00:02:08.039> also<00:02:08.369> moves

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
these super sequential law also moves

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
these super sequential law also moves
little<00:02:09.090> sequential<00:02:09.539> movements<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.500> have

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
little sequential movements so we have

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
little sequential movements so we have
the<00:02:10.739> spring<00:02:11.009> housing<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.580> piston<00:02:12.120> housing<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the spring housing a piston housing and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.250 
the spring housing a piston housing and
the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.809 
the

justment to the spring is performed by

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.910 
justment to the spring is performed by
winding<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.989> out<00:02:16.049> this<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.439> boat<00:02:16.590> here

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
winding in and out this little boat here

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.979 
winding in and out this little boat here
and<00:02:17.310> locking<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.879> place<00:02:18.060> by<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.510> locking<00:02:18.959> nut

and locking in place by the locking nut

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.500 
and locking in place by the locking nut
so<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> fully<00:02:20.010> adjustable<00:02:20.280> type<00:02:20.939> blow<00:02:21.329> off

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
so a fully adjustable type blow off

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
so a fully adjustable type blow off
valve<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.799> hundred<00:02:22.860> percent<00:02:23.040> working
