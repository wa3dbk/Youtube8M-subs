00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:07.870
I'm here at the Craftsman Experience.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.580
My name is Mike.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.160
I'm the in-house woodworker here.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.660
And one of the things we built,
being the Labor Day weekend,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.682
was a picnic table.

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:15.700
Now, this just isn't
your normal picnic table.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.150
We threw the idea out to you
guys, the viewers, over Facebook,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.450
and you came back with
some pretty cool ideas.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.210
So what we did is actually
made a nice little area here

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.340
where you could put a keg right in
the middle of your picnic table.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.360
Now, building a picnic
table like this, being

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.680
that it is a little more fancy than
your normal boxed picnic table,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.260
does take a little bit
more time and effort,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.190
but can still be done over the
weekend and in time for Labor Day.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.040
Now, what we used for this
table was clear redwood.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.880
The reason being, it's very
mold and mildew resistant,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.540
and doesn't tend to shrink or
expand in the elements outside.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.980
You can use a more moderately priced
wood, which would work just as well.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.080
For a project like this, you're
really going to need the right tools.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.080
And this is where Craftsman
can really help you out.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.550
For my cuts and my miters I used a
miter box with a 10 inch blade on it.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.510
For my bench rips, since I wanted
to keep it at specific dimensions,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.970
I ran these through the table saw.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.920
Two key, big, power tools
that you're going to need.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.133
On a smaller level, you're
going to need a jigsaw

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:30.620
to make your nice, rounded custom edges
on both the top and the benches here.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.900
You're going to need some bolts
for the support beams here,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.510
and some sandpaper to finish off your
cuts to give it a nice smooth finish.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.070
Here's a handy tip for you-- when making
the cut on the outside of your table,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.110
you want to leave all your boards long
and approximately the same distance.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.670
You're going to find the center of
your table and put a screw in there.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.010
Depending on how wide
you want your table,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.630
you're going to take a
piece of string and pull it.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.380
And you're going to mark it all the
way around the outside of your table

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.014
before you run your jigsaw through
and sand it up to make it look nice.

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:07.180
Now, this will work for the outside of
the table, as well as the inside hole

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.470
as well.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.450
Now, a project like this may
be a little more complicated

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.960
than what you're looking for,
but is extremely rewarding trying

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.790
to impress your friends and
your family because you've

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.240
got a keg in the middle of your picnic
table, and no one else has that.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.515
So we'd like to thank
