00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you know if you think about it extreme

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.560 
you know if you think about it extreme
condition<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> might<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> couple

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

kills<00:01:42.750> off<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> beginning<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.070> gets<00:01:44.189> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
kills off the beginning and it gets you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
kills off the beginning and it gets you
any<00:01:44.520> action<00:01:44.850> faster<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.110> opinion

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
any action faster but in my opinion

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
any action faster but in my opinion
sleight<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> hand<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.149> for

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
sleight of hand is a lot better just for

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.609 
sleight of hand is a lot better just for
the<00:01:48.390> simple<00:01:48.750> fact<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.470> have

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the simple fact that you don't have

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
the simple fact that you don't have
unlimited<00:01:49.649> sprint<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.549> only<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.329> longer

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
unlimited sprint it's only for longer

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
unlimited sprint it's only for longer
distance<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> totally<00:01:52.770> retarded<00:01:52.979> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
distance which is totally retarded I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.340 
distance which is totally retarded I
don't<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.360> why<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.659> couldn't<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.990> left

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
don't know why they couldn't just left

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
don't know why they couldn't just left

start heading back towards the building
and<00:02:32.290> Wi-Fi<00:02:32.799> be<00:02:33.010> flag<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.489> play<00:02:33.670> domination

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and Wi-Fi be flag if you play domination

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.599 
and Wi-Fi be flag if you play domination
so<00:02:35.530> yeah<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.709> just<00:02:35.859> taking<00:02:36.189> them<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.430> by<00:02:36.579> one

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
so yeah I'm just taking them one by one

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.360 
so yeah I'm just taking them one by one
you<00:02:37.599> know<00:02:37.719> I<00:02:37.989> see<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.590> all<00:02:38.680> my<00:02:38.829> teammates<00:02:39.159> are

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you know I see that all my teammates are

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.559 
you know I see that all my teammates are
behind<00:02:39.579> me<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.849> I'm<00:02:39.939> figuring<00:02:40.150> knew<00:02:40.389> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
behind me so I'm figuring knew the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.599 
behind me so I'm figuring knew the
spawning<00:02:40.840> right<00:02:41.139> here<00:02:41.439> or<00:02:41.829> inside<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> little

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
spawning right here or inside a little

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.009 
spawning right here or inside a little
the<00:02:43.090> bunker<00:02:43.389> I<00:02:43.419> guess<00:02:43.599> you<00:02:43.689> could<00:02:43.840> call<00:02:43.959> it

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
the bunker I guess you could call it

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.349 
the bunker I guess you could call it
where<00:02:44.230> see<00:02:44.409> flag<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.859> coming<00:02:45.819> up<00:02:45.939> here<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
where see flag is coming up here is the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.479 
where see flag is coming up here is the
last<00:02:46.510> kill<00:02:46.780> from<00:02:46.930> MOA<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:48.099> did<00:02:48.310> play<00:02:48.459> a

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
