00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.290
 rush 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.250
 judging by the information on the official website 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.980
 the game was supposed to go on sale yet 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 in the spring but the publisher did a lot 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 mechanics and finally introduced the test

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.490

 make a few frames of the game on this 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.320

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.050
 Simplified and slightly more aggressive 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.870

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.340
