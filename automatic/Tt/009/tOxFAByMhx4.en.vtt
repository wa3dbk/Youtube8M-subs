gold so let's see we're going to start

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.039 
gold so let's see we're going to start
out<00:01:35.490> by<00:01:35.640> talking<00:01:35.700> about<00:01:36.210> speed<00:01:36.630> leveling

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
out by talking about speed leveling

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
out by talking about speed leveling
myths<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.220> video<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> show

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
you all the speed leveling myths and I'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
you all the speed leveling myths and I'm
going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> truths<00:01:42.720> are

about<00:01:43.350> real<00:01:43.890> speed<00:01:44.250> leveling<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> first

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
about real speed leveling so the first

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.560 
about real speed leveling so the first
myth<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> hear<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.850> paying

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
myth is this is one I hear a lot paying

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.880 
myth is this is one I hear a lot paying
for<00:01:48.780> power<00:01:48.960> leveling<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> quickest

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for power leveling is the quickest

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.149 
for power leveling is the quickest
solution<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.460> might<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.810> easiest

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
solution it might be the easiest

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.850 
solution it might be the easiest
pain-free<00:01:53.180> solution<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.320> honestly

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
pain-free solution but I I honestly

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
pain-free solution but I I honestly
don't<00:01:56.009> recommend<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.479> reason

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
don't recommend it at all the reason

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.149 
don't recommend it at all the reason
being<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.229> number<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
being is because number one you have to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
being is because number one you have to
pay<00:01:59.369> someone<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.090> something<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.630> can

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
pay someone to do something that you can

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
pay someone to do something that you can
do<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:00.899> easily<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.549> goes<00:02:02.820> against

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
do very easily and this goes against

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.899 
do very easily and this goes against
everything<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.909> paying

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
everything that I think of but paying

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
everything that I think of but paying
for<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.450> actually<00:02:06.750> bad<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.290> number

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
for this is actually bad because number

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859 
for this is actually bad because number
one<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.910> won't<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.390> able<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> access<00:02:09.720> your

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
one you won't be able to access your

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.250 
one you won't be able to access your
account<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> half<00:02:10.830> weeks

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
account for two and a half weeks

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.809 
account for two and a half weeks
maybe<00:02:12.560> more<00:02:12.799> sometimes<00:02:13.189> it<00:02:13.370> depends<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.700> how

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
maybe more sometimes it depends on how

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.600 
maybe more sometimes it depends on how
quick<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.180> service<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.540> got<00:02:14.689> is<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.610> number

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
quick the service you got is and number

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.270 
quick the service you got is and number
two<00:02:16.939> it's<00:02:17.450> very<00:02:17.599> very<00:02:18.290> easy<00:02:18.650> for<00:02:18.799> you<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.189> get

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
two it's very very easy for you to get

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.800 
two it's very very easy for you to get
banned<00:02:19.579> I<00:02:19.819> promise<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.599> because

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
banned I promise you this because

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.420 
banned I promise you this because
Blizzard<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.439> actually<00:02:21.709> cracking<00:02:22.069> down<00:02:22.189> on

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
Blizzard is actually cracking down on

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.309 
Blizzard is actually cracking down on
their<00:02:22.879> security<00:02:23.239> with<00:02:23.569> power<00:02:23.810> leveling<00:02:24.140> and

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
their security with power leveling and

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.170 
their security with power leveling and
they<00:02:25.069> think<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.370> breaks<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.700> mechanics<00:02:26.090> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
they think it breaks the mechanics of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.399 
they think it breaks the mechanics of
the<00:02:26.299> game<00:02:26.329> it<00:02:26.689> makes<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.989> harder<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.290> other

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
the game it makes it harder for other

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.350 
the game it makes it harder for other
people<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.890> compete<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.370> each<00:02:28.489> other<00:02:28.610> so

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
people to compete with each other so

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.089 
people to compete with each other so
they're<00:02:29.780> actually<00:02:30.170> cracking<00:02:30.349> down<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.950> and

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
they're actually cracking down on it and

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.009 
they're actually cracking down on it and
how<00:02:31.370> they're<00:02:31.579> doing<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.150> their<00:02:32.659> tracking

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
how they're doing this is their tracking

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.199 
how they're doing this is their tracking
your<00:02:33.140> IP<00:02:33.319> address<00:02:33.829> if<00:02:34.040> they<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.519> login<00:02:34.909> in

once<00:02:58.549> they<00:02:58.639> think<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.030> your<00:02:59.180> power<00:02:59.389> leveling

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
once they think that your power leveling

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.990 
once they think that your power leveling
they<00:02:59.900> will<00:03:00.139> be<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.349> your<00:03:00.440> account<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.000> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
they will be in your account and and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.899 
they will be in your account and and
they<00:03:02.659> won't<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:02.930> twice<00:03:03.079> about<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:04.879> I

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
they won't think twice about it so I

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.220 
they won't think twice about it so I
definitely<00:03:05.150> recommend<00:03:05.389> power<00:03:05.930> leveling

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
definitely recommend power leveling

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
definitely recommend power leveling
because<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.650> something<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.040> can<00:03:07.159> do

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
because it's something that you can do

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.619 
because it's something that you can do
very<00:03:07.489> easily<00:03:07.609> I'm<00:03:08.150> going<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.329> show<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:08.599> to

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
very easily I'm going to show you how to

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.080 
very easily I'm going to show you how to
do<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.049> this<00:03:09.109> video<00:03:09.379> a<00:03:09.819> lot<00:03:10.819> of<00:03:10.909> people

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
do that in this video a lot of people

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.759 
do that in this video a lot of people
think<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.480> grinding<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.319> fastest

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
think that grinding is the fastest

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.039 
think that grinding is the fastest
solution<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.690> one<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:14.989> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
solution and it's not it's one of the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.270 
solution and it's not it's one of the
slowest<00:03:15.319> ways<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.859> I'm<00:03:15.980> going<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.190> show<00:03:16.250> you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
slowest ways and I'm going to show you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.229 
slowest ways and I'm going to show you
something<00:03:16.579> I'm<00:03:16.699> gonna<00:03:16.790> show<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:17.030> four<00:03:17.209> things

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
something I'm gonna show you four things

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:17.800

why<00:03:18.290> grinding<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:18.889> terrible<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
why grinding is terrible it's the

the hard way I leveled a character from

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.909 
the hard way I leveled a character from
1<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.940> 60<00:03:26.329> back<00:03:26.599> before<00:03:26.810> Burning<00:03:27.319> Crusade<00:03:27.349> and

about two months after doing that

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.759

and you will hate the game I promise
there<00:03:52.669> are<00:03:52.819> faster<00:03:53.209> methods<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:53.629> I<00:03:53.750> said

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
there are faster methods like I said

then<00:03:54.440> grinding<00:03:54.799> grinding<00:03:55.069> is<00:03:55.250> actually<00:03:55.519> one

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
then grinding grinding is actually one

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.309 
then grinding grinding is actually one
of<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:55.970> slowest<00:03:56.299> not<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.690> slowest<00:03:57.049> but<00:03:57.169> it's

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
of the slowest not the slowest but it's

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.770 
of the slowest not the slowest but it's
one<00:03:57.409> of<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.560> slowest<00:03:57.859> ways<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.510> then<00:03:59.510> less

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
one of the slowest ways and then less

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.449 
one of the slowest ways and then less
than<00:03:59.959> one<00:04:00.199> percent<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.650> your<00:04:00.680> time<00:04:00.949> leveling

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
than one percent of your time leveling

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.909 
than one percent of your time leveling
should<00:04:01.699> be<00:04:01.790> spent<00:04:02.120> grinding<00:04:02.690> mindlessly<00:04:03.290> and

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
should be spent grinding mindlessly and

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.250 
should be spent grinding mindlessly and
by<00:04:04.280> mindlessly<00:04:04.699> I<00:04:04.819> mean<00:04:05.120> sitting<00:04:06.079> there

by mindlessly I mean sitting there

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.559 
by mindlessly I mean sitting there
killing<00:04:06.500> mob<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.739> thermometer<00:04:07.129> mob<00:04:07.579> just<00:04:08.359> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.680 
get experience if it's not a part of a
quest<00:04:10.549> then<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.060> shouldn't<00:04:11.299> be<00:04:11.359> doing<00:04:11.629> it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
quest then you shouldn't be doing it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.080 
quest then you shouldn't be doing it
lesson<00:04:12.079> literally<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:12.979> was<00:04:13.010> less<00:04:13.430> than<00:04:13.459> 1%

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
lesson literally that was less than 1%

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.140 
lesson literally that was less than 1%
of<00:04:14.120> your<00:04:14.209> time<00:04:14.419> should<00:04:14.659> be<00:04:14.690> spent<00:04:14.900> doing<00:04:15.169> that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
of your time should be spent doing that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.029 
of your time should be spent doing that
leveling<00:04:17.150> should<00:04:17.359> take<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.570> lot<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:17.959> time<00:04:18.139> it

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
leveling should take a lot of time it

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.050 
leveling should take a lot of time it
should<00:04:19.190> take<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.340> long<00:04:19.519> time<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.940> that's

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
should take a long time and that's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.000 
should take a long time and that's
totally<00:04:20.359> false<00:04:20.510> also<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.169> very<00:04:21.440> quick<00:04:21.709> 11

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
video how to do that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.600 
video how to do that
I'm<00:04:25.120> using<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.889> couple<00:04:26.889> quick<00:04:27.130> methods<00:04:27.490> will

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
I'm using a couple quick methods will

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.710 
I'm using a couple quick methods will
get<00:04:27.730> your<00:04:27.850> level<00:04:28.030> sending<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> lot<00:04:28.480> quicker

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
get your level sending a lot quicker

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.530 
get your level sending a lot quicker
than<00:04:28.810> what<00:04:28.990> you're<00:04:29.110> doing<00:04:29.290> right<00:04:29.470> now

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
than what you're doing right now

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.000 
than what you're doing right now
grouping<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.780> instancing<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.710> quickest

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
grouping and instancing is the quickest

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.680 
grouping and instancing is the quickest
way<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.220> level<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.729> this<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.090> actually<00:04:34.449> one<00:04:34.660> of

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
way to level and this is actually one of

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.909 
way to level and this is actually one of
the<00:04:34.810> slowest<00:04:35.080> ways<00:04:35.229> actually<00:04:35.560> put<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:35.770> right

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
the slowest ways actually put this right

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.000 
the slowest ways actually put this right
behind<00:04:36.220> grinding<00:04:36.760> because<00:04:37.410> grouping<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.620> very

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
behind grinding because grouping is very

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.180 
behind grinding because grouping is very
hard<00:04:39.190> now<00:04:39.340> between<00:04:39.729> 169<00:04:40.660> it's<00:04:41.620> very<00:04:41.979> hard<00:04:42.160> to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
hard now between 169 it's very hard to

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.350 
hard now between 169 it's very hard to
get<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> group<00:04:42.550> because<00:04:42.699> most<00:04:43.060> players<00:04:43.210> are

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
get a group because most players are

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.150 
get a group because most players are
level<00:04:43.720> 70<00:04:44.080> trying<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.380> get<00:04:44.710> their<00:04:44.830> characters

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
level 70 trying to get their characters

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.189 
level 70 trying to get their characters
more<00:04:45.370> gear<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.850> they<00:04:46.419> are<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:46.870> really<00:04:47.080> trying

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
more gear and they are not really trying

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.540 
more gear and they are not really trying
to<00:04:47.380> help<00:04:47.500> out<00:04:47.650> at<00:04:47.770> lower<00:04:47.979> level<00:04:48.250> characters

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
to help out at lower level characters

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.439 
to help out at lower level characters
because<00:04:48.790> it's<00:04:48.880> going<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.060> do<00:04:49.150> nothing<00:04:49.419> for

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
because it's going to do nothing for

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.659 
because it's going to do nothing for
them<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.740> it's<00:04:51.010> going<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.190> be<00:04:51.280> very<00:04:51.370> hard<00:04:51.639> to

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
them so it's going to be very hard to

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.860 
them so it's going to be very hard to
get<00:04:51.820> groups<00:04:52.090> because<00:04:52.389> there's<00:04:52.540> not<00:04:52.660> gonna<00:04:52.750> be

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
get groups because there's not gonna be

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.960 
get groups because there's not gonna be
that<00:04:52.990> many<00:04:53.530> people<00:04:53.650> there<00:04:53.979> form<00:04:54.580> groups<00:04:54.790> with

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
that many people there form groups with

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.690 
that many people there form groups with
and<00:04:55.860> instances<00:04:56.860> are<00:04:56.949> actually<00:04:57.190> slow<00:04:57.370> anyways

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and instances are actually slow anyways

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.890 
and instances are actually slow anyways
because<00:04:57.880> once<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.240> get<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.419> group<00:04:58.600> for<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
because once you get a group for that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.240 
because once you get a group for that
let's<00:04:59.080> say<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.290> get<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.710> quick<00:04:59.889> let's<00:05:00.070> say<00:05:00.160> you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
let's say you get it quick let's say you

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.430 
let's say you get it quick let's say you
get<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> group<00:05:00.580> in<00:05:00.760> 20<00:05:01.090> minutes<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:02.200> get<00:05:02.320> your

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
get a group in 20 minutes you get your

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.629 
get a group in 20 minutes you get your
group<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.740> you're<00:05:02.830> already<00:05:03.040> at<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.280> instance

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
group and you're already at the instance

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.430 
group and you're already at the instance
once<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.000> go<00:05:04.090> inside<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.479> instance<00:05:04.810> you're

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
once you go inside the instance you're

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.900 
once you go inside the instance you're
going<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.620> be<00:05:05.710> killing<00:05:05.919> mobs<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.430> number<00:05:06.760> one

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
going to be killing mobs that number one

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.370 
going to be killing mobs that number one
they<00:05:07.030> take<00:05:07.210> longer<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.570> kill<00:05:07.810> because<00:05:08.169> they're

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
they take longer to kill because they're

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.600 
they take longer to kill because they're
harder<00:05:08.650> for<00:05:08.770> mobs<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.190> fight<00:05:09.310> that's<00:05:09.460> why<00:05:09.550> you

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
harder for mobs to fight that's why you

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.129 
harder for mobs to fight that's why you
have<00:05:09.700> five<00:05:09.850> people<00:05:10.000> killing<00:05:10.360> them<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.600> plus

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
have five people killing them and plus

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.420 
have five people killing them and plus
the<00:05:11.260> experience<00:05:11.740> gets<00:05:11.889> split<00:05:12.100> up<00:05:12.220> between

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
the experience gets split up between

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.969 
the experience gets split up between
five<00:05:12.550> people<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.660> it's<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:14.200> great<00:05:14.590> place<00:05:14.800> to

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
five people so it's not a great place to

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.340 
five people so it's not a great place to
UM<00:05:15.250> get<00:05:16.060> leveling<00:05:16.479> done<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:16.810> good<00:05:16.960> for<00:05:17.139> gear

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
UM get leveling done it's good for gear

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.870 
UM get leveling done it's good for gear
it's<00:05:17.590> good<00:05:17.950> for<00:05:18.130> if<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.340> want<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.490> have<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.669> fun

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
it's good for if you want to have a fun

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.430 
it's good for if you want to have a fun
factor<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:19.810> it's<00:05:19.960> definitely<00:05:20.080> not<00:05:20.289> the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
factor but it's definitely not the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.129 
factor but it's definitely not the
quickest<00:05:20.680> way<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.830> level<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:21.870> casual<00:05:22.870> players

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
quickest way to level and casual players

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.480 
quickest way to level and casual players
think<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.530> they<00:05:23.620> can't<00:05:23.830> hit<00:05:23.979> level<00:05:24.220> 70

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
think that they can't hit level 70

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.210 
think that they can't hit level 70
quicker<00:05:24.729> or<00:05:25.090> quickly<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.110> false<00:05:26.350> also<00:05:26.770> I

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
quicker or quickly and that false also I

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.279 
quicker or quickly and that false also I
think<00:05:28.150> casual<00:05:28.690> players<00:05:28.900> have<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.110> best

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
think casual players have the best

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.719 
think casual players have the best
advantage<00:05:29.650> because<00:05:29.860> once<00:05:30.070> they<00:05:30.220> learned<00:05:30.460> that

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
advantage because once they learned that

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.610 
advantage because once they learned that
they<00:05:31.150> can<00:05:31.330> solo<00:05:31.570> their<00:05:31.750> way<00:05:31.870> from<00:05:32.020> 1<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.289> 70

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
they can solo their way from 1 to 70

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800 
they can solo their way from 1 to 70
even<00:05:33.160> if<00:05:33.310> they<00:05:33.430> have<00:05:33.520> 15<00:05:33.970> minutes<00:05:34.270> even<00:05:34.720> if

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
even if they have 15 minutes even if

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.810 
even if they have 15 minutes even if
they<00:05:34.930> have<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.050> half<00:05:35.350> hour<00:05:35.560> or<00:05:36.310> maybe<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.580> couple

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
they have a half hour or maybe a couple

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.490 
they have a half hour or maybe a couple
hours<00:05:37.030> of<00:05:37.150> play<00:05:37.270> they<00:05:37.419> can<00:05:37.450> log<00:05:37.720> in<00:05:37.930> they<00:05:38.350> can

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
hours of play they can log in they can

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.900 
hours of play they can log in they can
do<00:05:38.590> what<00:05:38.710> they<00:05:38.800> need<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:39.010> do<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.430> do<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.729> next

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
do what they need to do to do the next

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.279 
do what they need to do to do the next
part<00:05:40.030> of<00:05:40.120> quest<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.479> they<00:05:40.570> can<00:05:40.720> log<00:05:40.840> back<00:05:40.870> out

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
part of quest and they can log back out

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.409 
part of quest and they can log back out
and<00:05:41.610> this<00:05:42.610> is<00:05:42.760> actually<00:05:43.030> what<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.150> want<00:05:43.360> to

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
and this is actually what you want to

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.760

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
you've been logged into the game on that

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.560 
you've been logged into the game on that
character<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:23.830> how<00:06:24.460> long<00:06:24.700> that<00:06:24.970> you've<00:06:25.419> been

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
level 17 you type slash played it'll

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.040 
level 17 you type slash played it'll
show<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.270> how<00:06:31.450> long<00:06:31.570> you've<00:06:31.750> been<00:06:31.840> in<00:06:31.960> the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
show you how long you've been in the

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.779 
show you how long you've been in the
game<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.440> you<00:06:32.889> can<00:06:33.039> do<00:06:33.159> that<00:06:33.250> in<00:06:33.400> under<00:06:33.550> six

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.130 
days and so that literally means if you
were<00:06:36.130> to<00:06:36.219> play<00:06:36.340> 24<00:06:36.669> hours<00:06:37.000> straight<00:06:37.210> for<00:06:37.780> six

other people that I've showed at level a

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.150 
other people that I've showed at level a
lot<00:06:47.110> quicker<00:06:47.290> just<00:06:47.560> from<00:06:47.830> using<00:06:47.950> these

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
lot quicker just from using these

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.490 
lot quicker just from using these
strategies
