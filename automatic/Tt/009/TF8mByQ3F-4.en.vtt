okay so this is my geo 704 meal that I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay so this is my geo 704 meal that I
have<00:00:05.040> converted<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.790> was<00:00:06.690> going<00:00:06.839> to

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
have converted I was going to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.599 
have converted I was going to
demonstrate<00:00:07.470> some<00:00:08.099> stuff<00:00:08.340> on<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:16.609> found

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
demonstrate some stuff on it I found

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:31.210 
demonstrate some stuff on it I found
about<00:00:17.760> 64<00:00:18.630> inches<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> minute

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.380 

not<00:00:32.220> mad

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.700 

what's<00:00:38.390> really<00:00:38.780> cool<00:00:39.019> is<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.559> Z

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:57.020 

it's<00:00:46.710> moving<00:00:47.100> pretty<00:00:47.130> good<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270 

now<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.450> can<00:00:58.720> push<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.990> little<00:00:59.110> bit<00:00:59.470> harder<00:01:00.070> I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
now I can push a little bit harder I

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.460 
now I can push a little bit harder I
don't<00:01:00.910> know<00:01:01.000> if<00:01:01.060> it'll<00:01:01.210> stall<00:01:01.450> out<00:01:01.690> I'm<00:01:02.170> still

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
don't know if it'll stall out I'm still

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.780 
don't know if it'll stall out I'm still
tweaking<00:01:02.590> on<00:01:02.950> it<00:01:04.860> no<00:01:05.860> problems<00:01:06.340> on<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.610> down

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
tweaking on it no problems on the down

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.290 

all<00:01:44.260> right<00:01:44.440> now<00:01:44.980> we'll<00:01:45.280> go<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.700> some<00:01:45.850> spindle

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
all right now we'll go for some spindle

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
control here you running EMC by the way

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.430 
control here you running EMC by the way
you<00:01:50.230> can<00:01:50.410> see<00:01:50.620> here<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.570> what<00:01:53.020> I'm<00:01:53.110> going<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.260> do

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
you can see here so what I'm going to do

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:07.080 
you can see here so what I'm going to do
is<00:01:53.680> I'm<00:01:53.800> going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.980> turn<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.160> spindle<00:01:54.670> on<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
is I'm going to turn a spindle on you

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.440 
is I'm going to turn a spindle on you
can<00:02:07.300> see<00:02:07.570> there<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.110> red<00:02:08.530> bar<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:10.060> actual

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
can see there the red bar is the actual

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.200 
can see there the red bar is the actual
speed<00:02:10.869> along<00:02:11.140> with<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> analog<00:02:12.400> meter<00:02:12.880> there

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
speed along with the analog meter there

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.900

the<00:02:13.720> green<00:02:13.990> bars<00:02:14.290> at<00:02:14.560> target<00:02:14.980> speed<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.760> I've

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
the green bars at target speed and I've

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.580 
the green bars at target speed and I've
got<00:02:16.120> up<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.870> says<00:02:16.900> whether<00:02:17.350> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
got up in there that says whether it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.660 
got up in there that says whether it
that<00:02:17.770> state<00:02:18.130> or<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that state or not you can see that it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.470 
that state or not you can see that it
work<00:02:24.850> here<00:02:27.060> can't<00:02:28.060> get<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.330> play<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> now

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
work here can't get the play so now

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
work here can't get the play so now
let's<00:02:31.720> run<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.980> theoretical<00:02:35.370> time<00:02:36.370> demo<00:02:37.000> here

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
let's run a theoretical time demo here

00:02:38.640 --> 00:03:11.920 
let's run a theoretical time demo here
and<00:02:39.640> go<00:02:39.820> ahead<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.150> hit<00:02:40.240> start

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.309 

thought<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:14.420> got<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> figure<00:03:15.689> out<00:03:15.930> why<00:03:16.140> it's

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
thought I got to figure out why it's

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.149 
thought I got to figure out why it's
doing<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:18.650> all<00:03:19.650> i'm<00:03:19.860> doing<00:03:19.890> is

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
doing that all i'm doing is

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.410 
doing that all i'm doing is
disconnecting<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.950> wiper<00:03:22.950> from<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.640> system

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
disconnecting the wiper from the system

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.850 
disconnecting the wiper from the system
and<00:03:24.569> i<00:03:24.599> think<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> driver<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> there's<00:03:25.650> not

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and i think the driver and there's not

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.960 
and i think the driver and there's not
doing<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.159> i<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.489> need<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.670> put<00:03:26.819> some

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
doing it i really need to put some

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.250 
doing it i really need to put some
control<00:03:27.390> relays<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.930> place<00:03:29.959> that's<00:03:30.959> about<00:03:31.230> it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
control relays in place that's about it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.620 
control relays in place that's about it
for<00:03:31.409> now
