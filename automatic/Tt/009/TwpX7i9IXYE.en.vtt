00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.080
 a little face of oh and well since 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 It is all this will remind them 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.250
 I remember I tell you that this has to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 doing it with a friend is necessarily with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.970
 a friend and you have to win ok 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 the configuration we are going to leave such 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.650
 which one and we're going to start it here if 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.590
 you have to win your friend do not you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.939
 I repeat and well since we are here 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 in the part of all this to sink and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.659
 we are going to hit the fence that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.600
 is on the left side ok and well 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.400
 we just have to accelerate and we're going 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560
 to have to press the placton button 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.110
 to be able to activate 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.820
 turbo nitrogen or whatever though in 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.890
 these heights of the race starts at 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.299
 activate there as you can observe and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.399
 we just have to press 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.530
 beast we have to destroy that lever 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.780
 of the horn and why are not we going to go 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.220
 running because I do not know very fast very very 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 fast and as good this will do that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.380
 the race is shortened and we finish it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.600
 too much too fast 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.149
 and how can they see we already won and then 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.009
 good only hard I think they are 25 yes 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.200
 are 25 seconds that is 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.509
 Pretty fast money is crap 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
 and rp give us 3000 so well then 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.990
 this race serves to unlock the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.469
 chrome engine and all this and apart 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.710
