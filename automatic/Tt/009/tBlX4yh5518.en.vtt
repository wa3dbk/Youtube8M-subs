00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello to you phil on this planet 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.510
 I will show you a lesson how to run 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.619
 windows 7 on your android smartphone 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.230
 done using a special program 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.750
 the necessary program and image of Windows 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.470
 here first we set all the parameters 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 how to start to start you need 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.189
 here create a new profile in this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.920
 case it is already created here choose 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:38.329
 sdl interface is already on 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.329
 CPU choose here core 2 duo 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.880
 then the number of cores 4 choose 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.880
 RAM 512 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 all 12 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.600
 sidir 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.189
 open it that is the path to the image 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.649
 which in general is now looking for an image 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:29.000
 who threw himself so here he is win7 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:29.000
 forest straighten device boot image 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.119
 sidir 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.860
 user network configuration 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.860
 choose a network card 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.969
 rtn e80 139 so 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.310
 here we are 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.790
 further video card virus 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:10.570
 functions of the Russian read the names so 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:13.550
 sound card from 97 t97 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.240
 they need to tick high 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.300
 a priority 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.290
 here ok 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.580
 that's all now run the whole thing 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:32.620
 image that is, we run the image now 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.880
 we press start and we wait while it will be 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.070
 run 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.130
 around one o'clock it's very long so 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.530
 Now we wait until it starts here 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.730
 by the way how on a computer all this business 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.630
 it works that is exactly the same 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 if you have periods and screws 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.810
 installed that is exactly the same here 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.130
 you don't need to touch anything here 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.020
 wait for seconds to pass 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 that is, just like a kit 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.720
 Basically loading is interesting all this 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.440
 Looks of course now we wait for loading 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.640
 until we install now it seems there was an image 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 then he will launch 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.700
 everything 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.850
 so here's a general launch now as 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.540
 we see now there should be an animation 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.250
 but will be with brakes it's all for now 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.140
 that is started all this stock 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.390
 It will pour out so we wait 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.290
 on general windows booted delayed 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.120
 quite long in general very long 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.940
 that's basically everything works that is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680
 here we are running the mouse in let's now 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.980
 try something to run for example 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.970
 bubbles 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.520
 this is full windows so here on them 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.070
 double click is a full windows on 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.170
 your windows 7 smartphone is not 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.540
 some program with a certain 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.140
 interface that looks like Windows 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.010
 and this is a specific image of Windows 7 which 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.040
 principle runs on android 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.040
 so but quite slow and 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.320
 that it is not for the use of some 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.600
 there are programs or games so this is pure 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.459
 just indulge in having fun then 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 there seems to be really working 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.830
 windows 7 more precisely it really works but 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.650
 cannot be used for various 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.600
 programs or games since the brakes are here 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.080
 in general, just awful, but for now 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.210
 have not yet figured out how to run 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.580
 real windows 7 cm which is not 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.950
 brakes which works fine for now 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.680
 I haven't thought of this yet and I think that if 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.900
 think up something I don't think it will 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.590
 work normally since android is still 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.240
 not powerful enough to run Windows 7 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.530
 so it is so far only on the computer she 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.580
 it works fine 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.070
 and let the basket start 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.200
 just have a little look at all 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.450
 the interface here seems to be truncated here 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.590
 as we see the design here at a minimum 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:14.110
 It is worth it, that is, I am not a Jumu 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.110
 he lags something so come on let me 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 pressed 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.210
 that 's just the start will start as 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:33.620
 see it very slowly everything works but 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:35.980
 works anyway get away with lags so but 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.730
 for some reason I do not know does not want to press 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.770
 so basket 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.470
 And the basket is something shorter than a glitch 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.810
 serious so we somehow don't 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.020
 close let's try it move 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.340
 will move hold I give like horseradish 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.310
 knows windows I don't know here for some reason 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.330
 windows by the way do not move so try 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.120
 go to start 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:05.139
 so of tooth already sew my computer 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:08.750
 computer for the day so okay overall 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:12.020
 hung like so here so here 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.820
 it all works but as if for fun 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.000
 for interest you can try 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.660
 install I think you will be interested here 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.740
 so full windows 7 works 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.919
 it is started that is it is really possible 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.340
 make install image image by the way 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:32.870
 weighs about 500 megabytes on average 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.550
 That's usually of course Windows 7 to much 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.650
 more all here and as if stripped down 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.780
 cut-down version 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.060
 presenting if you run a full 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.360
 screw the seventh which weighs 3 4 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.090
 gigabyte 3 without knowing the monster will be like this 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.980
 what even such a Windows to work with 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.740
 brakes but that's basically normal 2 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.010
