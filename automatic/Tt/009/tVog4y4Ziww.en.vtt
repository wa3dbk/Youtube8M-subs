body fat

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
body fat
remember<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.470> extra<00:00:19.920> muscle<00:00:20.220> tissue<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
remember that extra muscle tissue is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.920 
remember that extra muscle tissue is
what's<00:00:20.789> responsible<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.300> getting<00:00:21.630> fat<00:00:21.779> off

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what's responsible for getting fat off

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.570 
what's responsible for getting fat off
the<00:00:22.080> entire<00:00:22.320> body<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:22.769> squats<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.460> leg

the entire body actually squats and leg
extensions<00:00:24.029> probably<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.960> impact<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
extensions probably have more impact in

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.019 
extensions probably have more impact in
burning<00:00:25.740> fat<00:00:25.830> off<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> lower<00:00:26.220> abs<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> then

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
burning fat off the lower abs and then

abdominals safely remember wag lifts
anything<00:00:43.649> where<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.460> feet<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.789> out

anything where your your feet are out

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
anything where your your feet are out
far<00:00:45.270> away<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.289> arching

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
far away from you and you're arching

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
far away from you and you're arching
your<00:00:46.649> lower<00:00:46.829> back<00:00:47.039> works<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> hip<00:00:47.789> flexors<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
your lower back works the hip flexors it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
your lower back works the hip flexors it
really<00:00:48.510> doesn't<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:48.989> much<00:00:49.110> emphasis<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
really doesn't put much emphasis on the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
really doesn't put much emphasis on the
ABS<00:00:50.360> what<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.480> trying<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> do<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> basically

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
ABS what we're trying to do is basically

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.340 
ABS what we're trying to do is basically
rotate<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.969> pelvis<00:00:54.180> bone<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
rotate the the pelvis bone to the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
rotate the the pelvis bone to the
sternum<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.100> when<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.430> did<00:00:56.579> upper<00:00:56.879> abs<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
sternum so when you did upper abs you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
sternum so when you did upper abs you
pull<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.809> went<00:00:57.989> sternum<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> pelvis

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
pull down you went sternum to pelvis

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
pull down you went sternum to pelvis
that<00:00:59.370> works<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> upper<00:01:00.270> abs<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that works more the upper abs when you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
that works more the upper abs when you
do<00:01:01.410> lower<00:01:01.620> abs<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.070> bringing<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> pelvis<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
do lower abs are bringing the pelvis to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
do lower abs are bringing the pelvis to
the<00:01:03.030> sturm<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> opposite<00:01:03.840> direction

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the sturm it's the opposite direction

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
the sturm it's the opposite direction
and<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.100> can't<00:01:05.309> help<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.299> when

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and you can't help but work up or when

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
and you can't help but work up or when
you<00:01:06.510> work<00:01:06.659> lower<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.229> mean<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.040> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you work lower I mean they do kind of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
you work lower I mean they do kind of
contract<00:01:08.460> together<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.330> help

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
contract together but this does help

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
contract together but this does help
isolate<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.010> find<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> work<00:01:11.580> ABS<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.000> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
isolate it and I find if I work ABS if I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
isolate it and I find if I work ABS if I
split<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.630> least<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
split them up at least you know do a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
split them up at least you know do a
little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.460> abdominal<00:01:14.909> region<00:01:15.150> each

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is probably the most basic way to work

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
table of the mat around the floor just

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.310 
table of the mat around the floor just
like<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
like that

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.830 
like that
now<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.399> motion<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.450> ahead<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.689> bring<00:01:45.780> your

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
now this motion go ahead and bring your

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.730 
now this motion go ahead and bring your
feet<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.320> second

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
feet up for a second

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
feet up for a second
this<00:01:47.310> motion<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:47.909> anything<00:01:48.420> past

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this motion right here anything past

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
this motion right here anything past
this<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.439> hip<00:01:49.649> flexor<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.310> really

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this is more hip flexor it's not really

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.039 
this is more hip flexor it's not really
getting<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.060> abdominal<00:01:51.509> muscles<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
getting the abdominal muscles all that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
getting the abdominal muscles all that
much<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.790> knees

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
much so you really don't want your knees

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.399 
much so you really don't want your knees
to<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.509> further<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.380> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to go that much further than this like a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.160 
to go that much further than this like a
45<00:01:55.890> degree<00:01:56.009> angle<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.520> most<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> tell

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
45 degree angle at most so what I tell

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
45 degree angle at most so what I tell
people<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.250> touch<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.790> toes<00:01:59.820> tap<00:02:00.390> your

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
people is to touch your toes tap your

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.209 
people is to touch your toes tap your
toes<00:02:00.719> down<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> table<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.950> rock

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
toes down to the table and then rock

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.539 
toes down to the table and then rock
back<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.509> by<00:02:04.469> doing<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> tapped

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
back so by doing this if you tapped

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
back so by doing this if you tapped
anything<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.030> than<00:02:06.149> your<00:02:06.329> toes<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.600> your

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
anything other than your toes like your

anything other than your toes like your
entire<00:02:07.020> foot<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.469> your<00:02:07.590> heel<00:02:07.890> you'd<00:02:08.369> be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
entire foot or your heel you'd be

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.070 
entire foot or your heel you'd be
tempted<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.910> go<00:02:09.030> further<00:02:09.270> away<00:02:09.660> you'd<00:02:09.929> keep

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
tempted to go further away you'd keep

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.180 
tempted to go further away you'd keep
your<00:02:10.140> feet<00:02:10.410> farther<00:02:10.619> away<00:02:10.770> from<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:11.039> body

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
your feet farther away from your body

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.240 
your feet farther away from your body
you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.459> feel<00:02:11.610> your<00:02:11.700> back<00:02:11.849> start<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> arch

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
you can feel your back start to arch

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.780 
you can feel your back start to arch
and<00:02:14.380> slowly<00:02:15.380> back<00:02:15.710> down<00:02:15.770> just<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.550> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and slowly back down just like that so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.400 
and slowly back down just like that so
that's<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> first<00:02:17.330> basic<00:02:17.750> exercise<00:02:18.170> for

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that's the first basic exercise for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's the first basic exercise for

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
right but uh we're going to do a little

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.250 
right but uh we're going to do a little
bit<00:02:29.120> more<00:02:29.300> advanced<00:02:29.570> principle<00:02:30.050> here<00:02:30.170> going

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
bit more advanced principle here going

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.420 
bit more advanced principle here going
to<00:02:30.350> bring<00:02:30.470> your<00:02:30.590> knees<00:02:30.710> back<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:31.070> your<00:02:31.190> chest

and now rotate pushing your fingers into
the<00:02:34.070> table<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:34.940> hips<00:02:35.090> actually<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.570> to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
the table so your hips actually going to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.630 
the table so your hips actually going to
rise<00:02:35.840> off<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.290> table<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.680> little<00:02:36.800> bit<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.190> then

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
rise off the table a little bit and then

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.850

just<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.960> this<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.250> much

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just like that this is actually much

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.490 
just like that this is actually much
more<00:02:43.670> direct<00:02:44.030> exercise<00:02:44.630> for<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.320> lower

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
more direct exercise for the lower

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.840 
more direct exercise for the lower
abdominal<00:02:45.709> muscles<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.580> hips<00:02:46.730> are

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
abdominal muscles because the hips are

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.430 
abdominal muscles because the hips are

the same side every day first so some

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.420 
the same side every day first so some
days<00:04:06.500> you're<00:04:06.799> going<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.950> train<00:04:07.160> your<00:04:07.310> left

hand<00:05:42.669> there<00:05:42.909> just<00:05:43.210> like<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.389> so<00:05:44.199> basically

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
hand there just like that so basically

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.709 
hand there just like that so basically
that's<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.889> range<00:05:45.070> of<00:05:45.250> motion<00:05:45.599> now<00:05:46.599> if<00:05:46.659> you

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
that's the range of motion now if you

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:47.879 
that's the range of motion now if you
get<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:46.870> little<00:05:47.080> pause<00:05:47.289> here<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.710> fully

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
get a little pause here in the fully

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.260 
get a little pause here in the fully
contracted<00:05:48.219> position<00:05:48.490> it's<00:05:48.849> better<00:05:49.030> and<00:05:49.180> it's

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
contracted position it's better and it's

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.459 
contracted position it's better and it's
harder<00:05:49.630> hold<00:05:50.139> it<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:50.469> then<00:05:50.560> slowly<00:05:50.830> back<00:05:51.070> down

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
harder hold it and then slowly back down

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.529 
harder hold it and then slowly back down
breathing<00:05:53.469> out<00:05:54.000> while<00:05:55.000> you<00:05:55.120> contract

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
breathing out while you contract

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.560 
breathing out while you contract
concentric<00:05:56.169> lis<00:05:56.320> breathe<00:05:56.979> out<00:05:57.159> slowly<00:05:57.940> back

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
concentric lis breathe out slowly back

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.399 
concentric lis breathe out slowly back
down<00:05:59.849> with<00:06:00.849> abdominal<00:06:01.300> training<00:06:01.449> we're<00:06:02.229> still

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
down with abdominal training we're still

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.570 
down with abdominal training we're still
trying<00:06:02.620> to<00:06:02.650> fatigue<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:02.949> muscle<00:06:03.039> within

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
trying to fatigue the muscle within

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.790 
trying to fatigue the muscle within
fifteen<00:06:04.240> repetitions<00:06:04.419> or<00:06:04.900> so<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.409> in<00:06:05.560> order<00:06:05.680> to

when you're doing this you go a little

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.390 
when you're doing this you go a little
bit<00:06:08.949> lower<00:06:09.070> down<00:06:09.370> here<00:06:10.590> okay<00:06:11.590> now<00:06:12.099> if<00:06:12.159> you<00:06:12.250> want

bother you or a little bit more
difficult<00:06:54.890> here<00:06:55.010> we're<00:06:55.100> going<00:06:55.190> to<00:06:55.280> go<00:06:55.370> like

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
difficult here we're going to go like

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.120 
difficult here we're going to go like
this<00:06:55.550> into<00:06:55.910> four<00:06:56.180> stages<00:06:56.480> up<00:06:56.930> and<00:06:57.740> then<00:06:57.860> try<00:06:58.100> to

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
this into four stages up and then try to

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.880 
this into four stages up and then try to
push<00:06:58.820> your<00:06:58.970> feet<00:06:59.150> up<00:06:59.240> towards<00:06:59.480> the<00:06:59.570> ceiling

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
push your feet up towards the ceiling

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.160 
push your feet up towards the ceiling
down<00:07:00.890> and<00:07:01.280> down<00:07:01.940> so<00:07:02.390> it's<00:07:02.510> like<00:07:02.600> a<00:07:02.660> four<00:07:02.870> stage

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
down and down so it's like a four stage

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.790 
down and down so it's like a four stage
movement<00:07:03.620> up<00:07:04.660> down<00:07:05.660> down<00:07:06.410> that's<00:07:06.680> the

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
movement up down down that's the

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.230 
movement up down down that's the
exercise<00:07:07.220> out<00:07:07.460> up<00:07:08.270> good<00:07:09.140> hold<00:07:10.130> on<00:07:10.190> one<00:07:10.340> second

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
exercise out up good hold on one second

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.580 
exercise out up good hold on one second
if<00:07:11.420> your<00:07:11.630> legs<00:07:11.870> are<00:07:12.050> straight<00:07:12.350> in<00:07:12.500> this

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
if your legs are straight in this

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.140 
if your legs are straight in this
position<00:07:13.070> and<00:07:13.310> you<00:07:13.430> go<00:07:13.580> down<00:07:13.760> that's<00:07:13.880> much

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
position and you go down that's much

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.880 
position and you go down that's much
more<00:07:14.360> hip<00:07:14.540> hip<00:07:14.960> flexor<00:07:15.290> involvement<00:07:15.770> so<00:07:15.830> you

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
more hip hip flexor involvement so you

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:16.840 
more hip hip flexor involvement so you
always<00:07:16.010> want<00:07:16.190> to<00:07:16.220> have<00:07:16.340> your<00:07:16.400> knees<00:07:16.520> slightly

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
always want to have your knees slightly
