you<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.420> try<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:27.630> think<00:04:27.750> about<00:04:28.170> how<00:04:28.200> someone

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you just try and think about how someone

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.440 
you just try and think about how someone
else<00:04:28.800> sees<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.760> obviously<00:04:30.030> sometimes

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
else sees you and obviously sometimes

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.130 
else sees you and obviously sometimes
it's<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.230> not<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.680> easy<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:33.140> you

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
it's it's not that easy to do and you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.600 
it's it's not that easy to do and you
know<00:04:34.169> if<00:04:34.500> you're<00:04:34.740> single<00:04:34.980> or<00:04:35.220> something<00:04:35.520> like

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
know if you're single or something like

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.640 
know if you're single or something like
that<00:04:35.700> then<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.030> can't<00:04:36.450> really<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:36.900> but

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
that then you can't really do that but

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.320 
that then you can't really do that but
if<00:04:37.680> you're<00:04:37.919> single<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:38.850> even

kind<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.490> fake<00:05:41.729> confidence<00:05:42.060> because<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:42.930> think

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
kind of fake confidence because I think

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.860 
kind of fake confidence because I think
confidence<00:05:43.530> sometimes<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.790> something<00:05:45.240> that

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
confidence sometimes is something that

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.230 
confidence sometimes is something that
can't<00:05:46.590> be<00:05:46.710> faked<00:05:47.070> even<00:05:47.640> though<00:05:47.820> it's

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
can't be faked even though it's

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.730 
can't be faked even though it's
something<00:05:48.750> that<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.110> know<00:05:49.290> in<00:05:49.470> a<00:05:49.560> lot<00:05:49.680> of

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
something that you know in a lot of

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.770 
something that you know in a lot of
situations<00:05:49.950> you<00:05:50.430> can<00:05:50.460> sometimes<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.630> best

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
situations you can sometimes the best

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.630 
situations you can sometimes the best
solution<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.770> just<00:05:53.070> try<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:53.280> keep<00:05:53.430> your

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
kind of let it completely control me and

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.660 
kind of let it completely control me and
it<00:06:31.200> would<00:06:31.320> have<00:06:31.410> taken<00:06:31.590> over<00:06:32.010> my<00:06:32.160> entire<00:06:32.250> life

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670
