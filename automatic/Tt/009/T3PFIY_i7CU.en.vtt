welcome<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:01.949> rest<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.250> garden<00:00:02.580> today<00:00:02.730> I

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
welcome to the rest of garden today I

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.010 
welcome to the rest of garden today I
want<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> talk<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.600> couple<00:00:03.810> of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
want to talk to you about a couple of

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.590 
want to talk to you about a couple of
ways<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.259> trellis<00:00:04.920> peas<00:00:05.339> peas<00:00:06.180> have<00:00:06.390> hollow

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
ways to trellis peas peas have hollow

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
ways to trellis peas peas have hollow
stems<00:00:07.049> they're<00:00:07.319> very<00:00:07.470> fragile<00:00:07.770> they<00:00:08.670> need<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
stems they're very fragile they need to

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.629 
stems they're very fragile they need to
climb<00:00:09.360> climbing<00:00:10.230> makes<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.710> easier<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.550> you

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
climb climbing makes it easier for you

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.400 
climb climbing makes it easier for you
to<00:00:11.670> pick<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> peas<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.480> also<00:00:12.719> provides<00:00:13.110> them

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to pick the peas it also provides them

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.530 
to pick the peas it also provides them
with<00:00:13.590> support<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.549> they're<00:00:14.700> not<00:00:14.820> damaged<00:00:15.299> by

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
with support so they're not damaged by

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540 
with support so they're not damaged by
the<00:00:15.599> wind<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.619> way<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.070> trellis

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the wind one way that you can trellis

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
the wind one way that you can trellis
peas<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.270> grow<00:00:18.420> them<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.660> buckets<00:00:18.869> or

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
peas is you can grow them in buckets or

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.990 
peas is you can grow them in buckets or
even<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> ground<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.880> use

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
even in the ground and you can use

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500 
even in the ground and you can use
tomato<00:00:21.359> cages<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> trellis<00:00:23.160> peas<00:00:23.510> will

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
tomato cages for the trellis peas will

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
tomato cages for the trellis peas will
easily<00:00:24.869> grow<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
easily grow up it you can see and you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
easily grow up it you can see and you
can<00:00:27.119> easily<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> peas<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.260> are

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
can easily get to all the peas that are

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
can easily get to all the peas that are
growing<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.119> another<00:00:30.119> way<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
growing in there another way that you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.160 
growing in there another way that you
can<00:00:31.430> trellis<00:00:32.430> peas<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> couple<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
can trellis peas is just by a couple of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.410 
can trellis peas is just by a couple of
steaks<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:36.620> stringing<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.239> want

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
steaks and stringing them and you want

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
steaks and stringing them and you want
to<00:00:39.510> string<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:41.870> putting<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.739> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to string them by putting you know a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.260 
to string them by putting you know a
line<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.160> string<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:45.059> jute

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
line of string this is actually jute

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
line of string this is actually jute
every<00:00:45.870> couple<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.320> inches<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
every couple of inches you can go up a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
every couple of inches you can go up a
little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.610> higher<00:00:47.820> as<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.230> peas<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.469> more

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
little bit higher as the peas get more

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
little bit higher as the peas get more
mature<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.390> weave<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
mature and you can kind of weave them in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.330 
mature and you can kind of weave them in
and<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> structure

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and out of there but this structure

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.369 
and out of there but this structure
looks<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.300> bit<00:00:54.510> flimsy<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
looks a little bit flimsy but it is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
looks a little bit flimsy but it is
strong<00:00:55.620> enough<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.039> support<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.579> peas<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
strong enough to support the peas the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
strong enough to support the peas the
wind<00:00:57.719> won't<00:00:57.870> damage<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.010> one

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
wind won't damage them and that's one

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
wind won't damage them and that's one
way<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> trellis<00:00:59.730> them<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:01.230> planted<00:01:01.680> some

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
way to trellis them I also planted some

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
way to trellis them I also planted some
peas<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> ground<00:01:02.489> over<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.300> provided

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
peas in the ground over here I provided

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
peas in the ground over here I provided
them<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> string<00:01:05.309> decline<00:01:05.700> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
them a little bit of string decline but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
them a little bit of string decline but
they're<00:01:06.119> actually<00:01:06.890> clinging<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> each<00:01:08.070> other

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
they're actually clinging to each other

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
they're actually clinging to each other
and<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:09.240> climbing<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> some<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and they're climbing on some of the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
and they're climbing on some of the
blackberry<00:01:10.770> brambles<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.420> mix<00:01:12.630> peas

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
blackberry brambles so you can mix peas

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
blackberry brambles so you can mix peas
in<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.610> other<00:01:14.670> fruit<00:01:15.479> plants

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in with some of your other fruit plants

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
in with some of your other fruit plants
or<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> even<00:01:16.409> grow<00:01:16.680> them<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:16.979> trees

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
or you can even grow them up trees

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
or you can even grow them up trees
they're<00:01:18.060> only<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.409> eight

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they're only around for about eight

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.359 
they're only around for about eight
weeks<00:01:20.570> they<00:01:21.570> won't<00:01:21.840> compete<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:23.189> one

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
weeks they won't compete and it's one

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
weeks they won't compete and it's one
way<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> tell<00:01:23.820> us<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> build

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
way to tell us up you can build

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
way to tell us up you can build
something<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.680> formal<00:01:26.189> over<00:01:26.909> here

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
something a little more formal over here

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080 
something a little more formal over here
I<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:28.070> chicken<00:01:29.070> wire<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.579> will<00:01:29.790> also

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I have chicken wire this will also

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.289 
I have chicken wire this will also
double<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> cucumber<00:01:31.939> charlton<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> couple

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
double as a cucumber charlton a couple

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
double as a cucumber charlton a couple
of<00:01:33.390> weeks<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> peas<00:01:34.799> will

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of weeks but you can see the peas will

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.609 
of weeks but you can see the peas will
grow<00:01:35.280> perfectly<00:01:36.210> fine<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> chicken

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
grow perfectly fine right up the chicken

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
grow perfectly fine right up the chicken
wire<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.189> over<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.360> side<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> have

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
wire and over on this side I have

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
wire and over on this side I have
another<00:01:40.079> string<00:01:40.500> trellis<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:41.610> are

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
another string trellis but these are

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.569 
another string trellis but these are
dwarf<00:01:41.909> peas<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> didn't<00:01:43.799> need<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.159> use<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
dwarf peas so I didn't need to use as
