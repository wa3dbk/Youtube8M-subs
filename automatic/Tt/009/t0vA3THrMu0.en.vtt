00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.870
 Here is a curious technology Well, we 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.799
 go ahead present to your attention 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.799
 another invention 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.529
 overgrown plants stones and snags if 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.779
 not swimming past fish could 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.730
 think that this is a terrestrial landscape but no 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.890
 it is all inside the aquarium 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.079
 underwater terrain technology 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.210
 came to us from japan there aquascaping 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.430
 appeared about ten years ago 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.739
 translated from English aquascape it here 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.100
 whether the landscape is built in this way 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.710
 to repeat some kind of natural form 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.350
 as a result, the picture is obtained in the aquarium 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.090
 but only live therefore aquascape era in 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.010
 unlike ordinary artists should 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.260
 keep up your creation 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.450
 form such elongated scissors 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.220
 water landscape artists as gardeners 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.560
 regrowth of leaves 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.899
 I wonder whether it is difficult to build an underwater 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.940
 the world is now learn before our eyes master 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.739
 will create a landscape in this yet 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.870
 empty aquarium first thing 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.719
 trace elements for plant growth further 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.060
 a layer of sand soak it with water canvas 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.350
 for underwater pictures ready now you can 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.780
 start creativity 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.960
 The basis of the composition will be this is a snag 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 this is the skeleton of iodine which is then all 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.969
 the rest of the water karting is now adding 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.679
 stones ready and finally the plant 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.749
 the inclusion carries this piece will 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.700
 bailiffs stones rooted and what to do 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.319
 here how to keep plants on their 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.389
 places for this aqua skaters 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.749
 use a special thread using 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:36.969
 you can tie a fly in some kind of stone 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.520
 someday left to fill the field 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.319
 an aquarium with water and and let through a thin 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.329
 pipe so that the flow does not break 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.459
 created composition a few hours 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.470
 painstaking work and underwater copy 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:52.940
 natural landscape ready 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.800
 And this invention for admirers 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.350
 aquarium fish but not for all 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.480
 and for the laziest in front of us aquarium 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 who cleans himself like this 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.350
 happens 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.270
 installed filtration system 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.800
 recycles dirt and waste for food 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.380
 vegetable origin 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.080
 and special LED lighting is not 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.970
 allows algae to grow excessively in 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.740
 aquarium 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.900
 truly lazy engine of progress 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.910
 but more about the technology that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 allows a person to do nothing we 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.680
 let's talk some other time not 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 skip next encyclopedia release 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.160
 inventions yet
