00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
use but in the meantime we have we have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
use but in the meantime we have we have
some<00:01:43.290> place<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> defend<00:01:44.149> see<00:01:45.149> look<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
some place to defend see look at that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990 
some place to defend see look at that
for<00:01:45.930> seeing<00:01:46.229> completion<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
for seeing completion that's right this
