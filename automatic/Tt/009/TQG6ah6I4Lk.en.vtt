00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.759
 very good people good fonts tribute you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 ok I think you're going to the installation of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 a bad latifah and good that it is very 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.360
 complete what it does is that this year of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.009
 more even graphical options of microns and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 well we can configure it actions 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.000
 graphic like we want too 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 what you can do that we do have 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
 old malillos orders that is not going very 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 well the game gets into them because that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 it's because we have little fps when 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.680
 we are playing and thanks to the option of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.679
 graph we can improve it almost double 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820
 or three times so that we can do better 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.610
 young crack 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.559
 for example, national at 10 fps because 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.050
 we can better pass it 30 changing 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.390
 graphic resolution less power for 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 that does not increase the cps and not go to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 stumbled as if he were going to the guide all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 Also added as the final batch the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 support to textures hd although if we 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.520
 We put a test touré for you 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 for in HD he gives us support and not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.199
 It is closed and they will look good because all 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.629
 the textures there's going to be the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.869
 installation to install was

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.319
 formal the shapley side would now be created 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.060
 what in the mod folder to be able 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.610
 install then the various more than 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.239
 we are going to put that in this case of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.239
 be it t pain 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.300
 here it's worth we have here the three match 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.320
 points that are the try to forge by 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.420
 defect and so far we close vale 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.220
 Now you to install what it stop 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.710
 as follow the default route of 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.680
 minecraft to install this then 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.610
 pressed the windows key more grip and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 not only this run here we put 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.010
 percentage app data percentage and it gave 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.860
 accept ok do not see here you two pointed 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.020
 minecraft and once here comes the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.140
 match folder that was just created by 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.630
 install for the first time in forge and here 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.970
 Simply copy wench lópez but not 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.680
 we have gone down and it is already 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.440
 look how easy it is that we were with him 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.130
 jorge tobalaba of we initiate what is the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.130
 customer 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.070
 ok and once here we give to play with 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.070
 the forge version starts 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.220
 once here we are now seeing 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.709
 we have a saddlebag others allotey faim more 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.430
 trade watch that only forges you we wanted 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.800
 here 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.230
 the tlte fahed masoud or tiffany vale 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.989
 we go to a player to see what works 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.640
 perfectly and we give here to this 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.590
 map that I think is worth once here to see 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.980
 the graphic kitchen we give to the escape 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.519
 we have here options and adjustments 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.560
 video 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.940
 now we see here that has more rational 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.769
 graph and we see that it works 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.200
 perfectly 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.850
 Now I will explain how to take out the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.620
 operation of this and get the most 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.139
 in this country 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.440
 this equals maximum the gps is there 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.380
 put your right butt unlimited 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.169
 why not make the most and now for 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.990
 configure it is worth this gives bar up 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.350
 of rendering if there was not a time 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.290
 computer you can normalillo profit 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.050
 Well, I recommend leaving here at 16 a 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.160
 butt why not ask for quite a graphic 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.470
 because with more butt frames because it looks 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.960
 more distance from the micra game though 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.810
 I recommend 16 because otherwise it prepares you 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.850
 graphic site was a normal computer and 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.669
 and for that reason I recommend lowering it a bit 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.030
 up to the level ocha that is for 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.640
 order us mallets if you have a bad 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.750
 ordered already recommended to put it to 4 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.479
 even at 2 inah I lowering it here already 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.370
 I will have improved even five times more 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.580
 the gps is that it will have gone from 100 to 500 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.620
 fps is for you to improve and a young 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.060
 while for it to really work 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.039
 goods between 30 and 60 fps is good not 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.660
 had done this because if we want 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.410
 improve more 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.870
 efe peses we have forest station that 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.470
 this is to make it look more foggy or 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.990
 do not 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.770
 as we see here the fog is changing 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.710
 when he likes it and if we put 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.229
 above the mouse are worth an option to put 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.220
 the description to rival for a bit the 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.950
 summary for 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.910
 know what the thing is then if we want 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.850
 improve even more the fps is to have the 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.760
 option to go here to details here 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.670
 you can activate in soil and the moon 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.950
 It's ok to activate or deactivate and well if you go 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.700
 removing by particles as it can 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:21.000
 improve the fp es is then if they go down and 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.370
 mateos vale puts like the animation of the 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.850
 which movements and all this and good 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.860
 we could give it here there are off and 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:31.560
 disable all these options to 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.140
 improve fps or we look at all the 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.620
 factions and up or if you want to des 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.000
 certain things where we are giving 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.250
 nothing then here is how it is activated and 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.070
 off and everything else was already 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.830
 would be minecraft by default 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.160
 most of these options although not 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.020
 I'm going to explain a lot and good people 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.090
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.950
 since he perfectly explained how 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.370
 install the fanny lot all these things 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:03.590
 and well it does not go in another tutor and
