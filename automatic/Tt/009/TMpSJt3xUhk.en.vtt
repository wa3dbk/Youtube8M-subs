profile<00:00:40.400> do<00:00:41.400> you<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.579> how<00:00:41.670> pan<00:00:41.970> which<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480

profile do you know how pan which one
would<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:43.430> louder<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.840> look

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
would be louder this will look

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
would be louder this will look
traditionally<00:00:46.770> louder<00:00:47.040> more<00:00:47.580> for<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> sporty

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
traditionally louder more for the sporty

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.470 
traditionally louder more for the sporty
ass<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.220> it'll<00:00:50.220> both<00:00:50.340> handle<00:00:50.760> better<00:00:50.970> but

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
ass so it it'll both handle better but

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.760 
ass so it it'll both handle better but
also<00:00:51.510> pick<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.230> bit<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.530> road

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
also pick up a little bit more road

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:03.790 
also pick up a little bit more road
noise<00:00:52.950> a<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.550> bit<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.790> road<00:00:54.000> noise

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
and we've got a church parking lot we're

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.410 
and we've got a church parking lot we're
gonna<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:06.960> MDF<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.790> medium<00:01:09.120> density

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
fiberboard we're gonna cut halfway

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
half inch wide similar to the groove we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.870 
half inch wide similar to the groove we
found<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> street

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

parking lot drive over to the two miles
an<00:01:22.619> hour<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:26.900> nothing<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
an hour and see what we get nothing the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.320 
an hour and see what we get nothing the
grooves<00:01:28.830> are<00:01:29.040> quite<00:01:29.340> singing<00:01:29.760> loud<00:01:30.000> enough

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
grooves are quite singing loud enough

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.359 
grooves are quite singing loud enough
for<00:01:30.360> us<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> hear<00:01:30.990> yeah<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:31.950> hoping<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
for us to hear yeah we're hoping if we

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
for us to hear yeah we're hoping if we
get<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.670> texture<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
get more texture on this one more like a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.730 
get more texture on this one more like a
road<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.729> opposed<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> board<00:01:36.630> setting<00:01:37.530> will

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
road as opposed to a board setting will

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:54.680 
road as opposed to a board setting will
generating<00:01:38.610> its<00:01:38.729> own

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.170 

we're<00:01:55.690> trying<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.020> reduce<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.440> chatter<00:01:56.740> of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
we're trying to reduce the chatter of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040 
we're trying to reduce the chatter of
the<00:01:58.180> MDF<00:01:58.770> onto<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> pavement<00:02:00.900> hoping<00:02:01.900> this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
the MDF onto the pavement hoping this

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.950 
the MDF onto the pavement hoping this
will<00:02:02.200> soften<00:02:02.440> it<00:02:02.710> up<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.490> finally<00:02:04.150> carpet

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
will soften it up the finally carpet

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.710 
will soften it up the finally carpet
under<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:06.130> MDF<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.760> think<00:02:06.970> towards<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> end<00:02:07.570> of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
under the MDF I think towards the end of

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.290 
under the MDF I think towards the end of
the<00:02:07.810> day<00:02:07.990> we<00:02:08.770> actually<00:02:08.920> got<00:02:09.490> some<00:02:09.700> potable

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the day we actually got some potable

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:23.220 
the day we actually got some potable
tone<00:02:21.540> eventually<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.660> were<00:02:22.780> able<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.050> get<00:02:23.200> a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
tone eventually we were able to get a

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
tone eventually we were able to get a
tone<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.800> realized<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.670> were<00:02:24.820> getting

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
tone and realized that we were getting

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.720 
tone and realized that we were getting
different<00:02:25.300> tones<00:02:25.660> from<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.020> different<00:02:26.320> gaps

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
different tones from the different gaps

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.670 
different tones from the different gaps
so<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.210> learned<00:02:28.420> all<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.870> could<00:02:29.050> from<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.320> we

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
so we learned all we could from that we

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.230 
so we learned all we could from that we
still<00:02:29.950> didn't<00:02:30.190> learn<00:02:30.280> how<00:02:30.520> pure<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> tones

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
still didn't learn how pure the tones

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.660 
still didn't learn how pure the tones
were<00:02:31.390> or<00:02:31.810> how<00:02:32.020> loud<00:02:32.260> they<00:02:32.410> were<00:02:32.500> gonna<00:02:32.650> be<00:02:32.830> so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
were or how loud they were gonna be so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.490 
were or how loud they were gonna be so
we<00:02:33.880> have<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.570> go<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.850> real<00:02:36.850> road<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.540> cut

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
we have to go get a real road and cut

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.070 
we have to go get a real road and cut
real<00:02:38.800> grooves<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:40.270> see<00:02:40.480> how<00:02:40.660> loud<00:02:40.840> it's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
real grooves in it to see how loud it's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.660 
real grooves in it to see how loud it's
going<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.320> be<00:02:41.470> we've<00:02:42.310> got<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> lot<00:02:42.640> more

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
going to be we've got a lot more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.690 
going to be we've got a lot more
calculating<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.600> do<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:45.190> need<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.460> do<00:02:45.580> it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
calculating to do and we need to do it

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.510 
calculating to do and we need to do it
