00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.600

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.350
 more to my channel to the clan of rose game and 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.020
 welcome to a news ww 2016 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.720
 As you can see in the title, they have been confirmed 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.890
 six new superstars for the 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.509
 next game of ww one of them is already 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.369
 I brought it in a video that had been 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.519
 previously confirmed but now it 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.519
 confirm with the render included that photo 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.149
 where good will be the official photo of 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.469
 fighter for the game as you know from 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.109
 Yesterday 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.239
 before these last days so to speak 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.480
 because I do not know when he's saying this 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.390
 video this week of June 15 will 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.940
 is celebrating the e3 in the angels the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.800
 biggest videogame fair where the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.859
 companies usually present their 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.949
 new titles with news and others and 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:58.429
 good unlike last year's 2k 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.519
 he had his lecture if I did not 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.470
 I'm wrong this year in the absence of surprises 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.530
 Does not have it 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.690
 well then up double-double removes 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.850
 those doubts that could present some 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.940
 type of trailer and others but good we 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.940
 surprise with this this article that have 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.280
 put on the official website of the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.580
 ww commenting on these six new 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
 superstars that I will comment on 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 Then I really expected 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.880
 a lecture by 2k 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.729
 know something more and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.100
 more than names I mean a kind of 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.700
 trailer or even a teaser a small 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.009
 teaser a something new advance 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.399
 well I think something will say no to regret 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.619
 that they do not have their own conference and if 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.079
 by surprise they get it to have hope 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.360
 I look forward to the truth and good 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.899
 the superstars are the following 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.530
 first confirmed the world champion of 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.470
 the vdw set rollings second daniel bryan 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.410
 third 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.930
 the lunatic ding ambrÃ³s good I think 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.330
 that are three pretty 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.910
 clear that they were going to be and I think that 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.470
 this despite the news last 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.900
 fighter could have been saved 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.210
 because they are fighters that you already know 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.860
 that are going to be you know it 's as if in the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.320
 fifa announce that the barÃ§a will be 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.900
 of madrid and bilbao etcetera is not 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.730
 something that you already assume is obviously going to 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.130
 be be rollings obviously later 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.780
 in the bryant obviously this will be 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.510
 man you see on the screen bandnews 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.540
 barrel that is this one I brought it in a 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.750
 last video 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.510
 we've already been four the fifth is a live 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.480
 and it is about page that binds to some 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.099
 divas already confirmed for the game that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.599
 have previous videos I recommend you 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.500
 look at the playlist of 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.859

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.250

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.099

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.670
 of next and that the fans and the 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.430

 to show us something else during this 3 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.600
 even though they do not have 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.970
 own conference but I think that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.490

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.700
