these<00:03:00.340> are<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.550> cutting<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.060> pieces<00:03:01.239> and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
these are just cutting out pieces and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.260 
these are just cutting out pieces and
putting<00:03:01.810> them<00:03:01.989> together<00:03:02.110> like<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> quarry

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
putting them together like in a quarry

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.180

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.250 

yeah<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:16.510> pretty<00:03:16.629> cool<00:03:16.810> why<00:03:16.930> don't<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.170> just

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
yeah it's pretty cool why don't you just

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.050 
yeah it's pretty cool why don't you just
cut<00:03:17.470> pieces<00:03:17.709> coming<00:03:18.640> together<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.939> that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
cut pieces coming together like that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.259 
cut pieces coming together like that
that's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.079> pretty<00:03:20.200> cool<00:03:20.379> stuff<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.269> practice

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
that's a pretty cool stuff so practice

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.530 
that's a pretty cool stuff so practice
at<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.150 

I<00:03:24.599> guess<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.680> could<00:03:26.010> put<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.250> tower<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.730> but
