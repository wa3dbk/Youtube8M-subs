quickly you can see like right there you

saw that a little bit of lag you can see

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.700 
saw that a little bit of lag you can see
that<00:05:47.090> there's<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.300> delay<00:05:47.600> here<00:05:47.630> because<00:05:48.620> it

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
that there's a delay here because it

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.110 
that there's a delay here because it

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
higher end ones and you're really seeing

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.110

kind<00:05:54.440> of<00:05:54.500> a<00:05:54.560> slow<00:05:54.770> down<00:05:54.950> here<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.790> comes<00:05:56.030> from

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
kind of a slow down here that comes from

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.930 
kind of a slow down here that comes from
having<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.660> on<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:57.680> single<00:05:58.040> core<00:05:58.190> processor<00:05:58.220> and

having it on a single core processor and

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.180 
having it on a single core processor and
so<00:05:59.030> obviously<00:05:59.420> we<00:06:00.380> cannot<00:06:00.590> do<00:06:00.800> a<00:06:00.830> battery<00:06:01.160> pull

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
so obviously we cannot do a battery pull

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.590 
so obviously we cannot do a battery pull
