00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.640
 i 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.730
 and you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.789
 Hello 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.129
 the silkworms are raised for the 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.460
 Obtaining silk is an activity 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.980
 complementary that with relatively 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.839
 little labor can generate revenue 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.479
 to the small producer pross and 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.530
 mediums who produces silk a 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.690
 insect that insect is one the calls 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.089
 vulgarly in butterflies in state 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 adult or so-called caterpillars in state 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.280
 larval this insect or butterfly or caterpillar 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.190
 as they want to call it has several 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 particularities first that is a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.130
 kind of domesticated by man 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.479
 if the butterfly the adult does not fly it does not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.149
 feeds if this one and the larva has as 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.700
 only food the mulberry leaf no 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.830
 consumes no other food other 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.530
 particularity is that the feeding 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.810
 should be with fresh leaves and what is the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.179
 biological cycle of this insect is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 they can raise usans of is given when there 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.530
 mulberry leaves that is from the middle of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.719
 September until the middle of April 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 how does this species pass the winter which 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.300
 is the form of the free 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.300
 It's like an egg 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.250
 between 12 and 14 days will hatch all 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.430
 the long ones that are initially very 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.320
 small ones are no more than a millimeter and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.200
 that for about 27 to 30 days pass through 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.720
 different larval stages that whose 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.990
 difference is the size they are fed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.700
 four times a day with fresh leaves 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.290
 when the larva arrived at the time of 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.810
 weave the cocoon looking for a place 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.020
 particular gmt with three support points 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.350
 and weaves like a cloud first yes and the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.020
 cocoon in the center that cocoon will 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.060
 harvest so when harvesting it the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.400
 cocoon has what is called erases 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 which are all the filaments that he used 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.800
 the larva to fix and be able to produce 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.200
 the cocoon after the harvest is 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.730
 takes place soon after seven days of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.890
 started the process of hooding 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.020
 the process is to have it removed 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.960
 flame is erased or is removed 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.200
 all these loose threads in such a way 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.090
 that the cocoon is practically 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.300
 cleansed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.269
 if we leave this cocoon in conditions 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.620
 normal environmental factors between 15 and 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.930
 20 days the butterfly is born to leave the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.670
 free cocoon releases a substance 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 alkaline that pierce the cocoon 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.780
 if the butterfly perishes by the cocoon 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.360
 filament is already cut and has no 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.960
 utility for obtaining silk 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 continuous filament that's why it's required 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.740
 interrupt the cycle for which it 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.270
 they usually use or cold to put us in 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.630
 a filter or on a stove 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.380
 or in a furnace about 12 or 24 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.720
 hours the cycle of the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.790
 butterfly and then we get the cocoon 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.440
 top quality for the process 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.380
 after obtaining the thread 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.340
 the vain of if is to take out the thread and 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.930
 transform it into a skein was done in 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.120
 hot water because this cocoon is 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.670
 composed of the thread and a substance 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.800
 that gives you that rigidity that has cocoon 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
 that is designated that softens in 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 aguascalientes once the neighbors 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.850
 branches break off the softened 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.860
 filaments 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.110
 the process of esteban a 2 is obtained 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.650
 as a first step what would be the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.349
 skeins of raw silk or silk straw 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.359
 this series signa is then extracted with 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.720
 washing with hot water a neutral soap 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.880
 it is said that in the ages crossed and 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.500
 regardless of the color of the cocoon 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.520
 that can be yellow can be white 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.610
 can be pink can be greenish silk 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.259
 It is always white or cream by 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.350
 everything is called second cocoon 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.870
 quality is processed as a trillion the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.520
 silk has many courses multiple uses 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.130
 from the point of view as fiber 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.990
 textile forms part of garments 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.870
 traditional religious ceremonials 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.780
 TÃ¡riq and monkeys also have use let's say 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.479
 medicinal good dental floss 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.310
 Quality is made with silk and laser and 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.940
 In recent times, they have 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.580
 discovered a lot of uses in 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.530
 cosmetic and medicinal products fits here 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.400
 faculty that is what you do with 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.520
 Search silk selection 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.500
 proof of those genetic lines or 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.919
 hybrids that have a behavior 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.229
 above average we are already doing 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.210
 preliminary studies and we have some 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.660
 hybrids protruding on 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.660
 average
