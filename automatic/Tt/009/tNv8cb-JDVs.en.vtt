treated myself I got myself a kiwi and
this<00:00:14.539> one<00:00:14.809> is<00:00:15.049> called<00:00:15.379> a<00:00:15.559> Kiwi<00:00:16.039> is<00:00:16.730> a<00:00:16.970> Issa<00:00:17.930> I

this one is called a Kiwi is a Issa I

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.890 
this one is called a Kiwi is a Issa I
think<00:00:19.250> that's<00:00:19.400> how<00:00:19.520> you<00:00:19.550> pronounce<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:20.150> now

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
think that's how you pronounce it now

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.489 
think that's how you pronounce it now
this<00:00:21.199> one<00:00:21.439> climbs<00:00:21.890> up<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.699> goes<00:00:22.910> across<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.570> I

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:24.499 
this one climbs up and goes across and I

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.980 
this one climbs up and goes across and I
always<00:00:24.679> wanted<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.310> Kiwi<00:00:25.759> but<00:00:26.359> they're<00:00:26.509> not<00:00:26.689> big

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
always wanted a Kiwi but they're not big

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.140 
always wanted a Kiwi but they're not big
Kiwis<00:00:27.589> their<00:00:27.829> little<00:00:28.249> Kiwis<00:00:28.730> they're<00:00:28.939> about

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
Kiwis their little Kiwis they're about

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.589 
Kiwis their little Kiwis they're about
the<00:00:29.359> size<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:30.070> grapes<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:31.939> I'm<00:00:32.180> just<00:00:32.390> going<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
the size of grapes so I'm just going to

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.229 
the size of grapes so I'm just going to
show<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:32.900> how<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.350> plant<00:00:33.860> this<00:00:34.160> now<00:00:34.910> when<00:00:35.090> you

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
show you how to plant this now when you

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.360 
show you how to plant this now when you
plant<00:00:35.540> one<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.810> these<00:00:36.079> they<00:00:36.320> need<00:00:36.560> a<00:00:36.770> structure

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
plant one of these they need a structure

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.090 
plant one of these they need a structure
to<00:00:37.489> climb<00:00:37.760> up<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:39.170> whether<00:00:39.410> you<00:00:39.620> put<00:00:39.649> a<00:00:39.860> bit<00:00:40.010> of

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
to climb up so whether you put a bit of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.220 
to climb up so whether you put a bit of
trellis<00:00:40.400> behind<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.180> or<00:00:41.300> whatever<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:41.660> know

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
trellis behind it or whatever I know

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.480 
trellis behind it or whatever I know
it's<00:00:42.410> entirely<00:00:42.710> up<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:42.980> you

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's entirely up to you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.340 
it's entirely up to you
but<00:00:43.880> what<00:00:44.030> I've<00:00:44.150> got<00:00:44.360> here<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.600> fence<00:00:44.900> panels

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
but what I've got here is fence panels

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.170 
but what I've got here is fence panels
with<00:00:45.560> some<00:00:45.980> trellis<00:00:46.490> going<00:00:46.760> across<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.150> top

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
with some trellis going across the top

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.990 
with some trellis going across the top
so<00:00:47.570> I'm<00:00:47.690> going<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.080> put<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:48.950> it<00:00:48.980> strains<00:00:49.670> up

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
so I'm going to put it so it strains up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.940 
so I'm going to put it so it strains up
and<00:00:50.240> goes<00:00:50.420> across<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:51.200> so<00:00:51.380> I<00:00:51.410> can<00:00:51.710> pick

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
and goes across like that so I can pick

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.040 
and goes across like that so I can pick
them<00:00:52.130> off<00:00:52.250> easily<00:00:52.490> but<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.450> first<00:00:53.750> thing<00:00:53.960> I

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
them off easily but the first thing I

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.410 
them off easily but the first thing I
need<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.290> do<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.650> to<00:00:54.770> dig<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.950> nice<00:00:55.130> big<00:00:55.190> hole<00:00:55.790> to

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
need to do is to dig a nice big hole to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:05.259 
need to do is to dig a nice big hole to
put<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.380> let's<00:00:57.950> get<00:00:58.190> Dickie<00:01:04.000> now<00:01:05.000> you

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
put it in so let's get Dickie now you

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.819 
put it in so let's get Dickie now you
need<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.540> check<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:05.810> your<00:01:06.110> hole<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.590> deep

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
need to check that your hole is deep

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.550 
need to check that your hole is deep
enough<00:01:07.040> it<00:01:07.909> needs<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.329> be<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.509> bit<00:01:08.750> wider<00:01:09.110> than

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
enough it needs to be a bit wider than

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.250 
enough it needs to be a bit wider than
the<00:01:09.710> pot<00:01:09.920> itself<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.180> once<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.020> you've

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
the pot itself so once you think you've

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.330 
the pot itself so once you think you've
dug<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> hole<00:01:12.770> deep<00:01:13.010> enough<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:14.620> pot<00:01:15.620> in<00:01:15.860> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
dug the hole deep enough the pot in and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.190 
dug the hole deep enough the pot in and
as<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.940> can<00:01:17.060> see<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.630> level<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.080> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
as you can see that the level of the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.930 
as you can see that the level of the
soil<00:01:18.470> will<00:01:18.800> come<00:01:19.010> up<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.430> level<00:01:19.730> of<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
soil will come up to the level of the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.149 
soil will come up to the level of the
soil<00:01:20.180> in<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.540> pot<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.409> don't<00:01:21.440> want<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.980> any

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
soil in the pot you don't want to any

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.890 
soil in the pot you don't want to any
deeper<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.820> don't<00:01:23.030> want<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.330> high<00:01:23.510> up<00:01:23.540> you

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
deeper and you don't want it high up you

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.860 
deeper and you don't want it high up you
want<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:25.400> soil<00:01:25.610> level<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.210> exactly<00:01:26.659> the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
want the the soil level is exactly the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.840 
want the the soil level is exactly the
same<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.680> doesn't<00:01:28.010> matter<00:01:28.190> if<00:01:28.430> there's<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.729> bit

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
same it doesn't matter if there's a bit

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.880 
same it doesn't matter if there's a bit
of<00:01:28.880> extra<00:01:29.210> space<00:01:29.540> round<00:01:29.900> here<00:01:30.260> we<00:01:30.440> can<00:01:30.590> always

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
of extra space round here we can always

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.490 
of extra space round here we can always
fill<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.400> in<00:01:31.700> now<00:01:32.540> there's<00:01:32.930> one<00:01:33.110> thing<00:01:33.140> we've

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
fill that in now there's one thing we've

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.010 
fill that in now there's one thing we've
got<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.860> do<00:01:33.979> before<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.670> put<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.570> let's<00:01:35.810> take

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
got to do before we put it in let's take

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.960 
got to do before we put it in let's take
it<00:01:36.200> out<00:01:38.770> they're<00:01:39.770> very<00:01:39.920> hungry<00:01:40.220> plants<00:01:40.880> so

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
it out they're very hungry plants so

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.340 
it out they're very hungry plants so
what<00:01:41.120> we<00:01:41.270> need<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.510> do<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> put<00:01:42.320> some

what we need to do is to put some

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.490 
what we need to do is to put some
compost<00:01:43.010> in<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> bottom<00:01:43.729> or<00:01:43.880> some<00:01:44.540> manure<00:01:44.900> so

hole

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.430 

just<00:02:09.649> put<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.630> give<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.780> bit<00:02:11.990> of<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.170> mix

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
just put that in give it a bit of a mix

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.240 
just put that in give it a bit of a mix

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
round so it gets all mixed up with your

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.180 
round so it gets all mixed up with your
soil<00:02:16.430> that's<00:02:16.760> already<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:17.800> okay<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> now

they're<00:02:39.620> going<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:39.980> growing<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:40.580> quite

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940

they're going to be growing it's quite
dormant<00:02:41.510> at<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.810> moment<00:02:42.500> because<00:02:42.680> obviously

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
dormant at the moment because obviously

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.520 
dormant at the moment because obviously
it's<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> winter<00:02:43.910> but<00:02:44.660> if<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.410> it

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's the winter but if you get it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.350 
it's the winter but if you get it
planted<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.070> now<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.400> get<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.730> settled<00:02:47.180> by<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
planted in now and get it settled by the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.510 
planted in now and get it settled by the
time<00:02:47.690> spring<00:02:47.900> comes<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.860> will<00:02:49.010> start<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.400> grow

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
time spring comes it will start to grow

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.780 
time spring comes it will start to grow
quite<00:02:49.970> quickly<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:52.870> turn<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.900> upside<00:02:54.410> down

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
quite quickly so turn it upside down

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.860 
quite quickly so turn it upside down
give<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.000> bash<00:02:56.270> on<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> bottom<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:58.630> bit<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.780> a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
give it a bash on the bottom a bit of a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.860 
give it a bash on the bottom a bit of a
shake<00:03:00.110> hopefully<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.280> will<00:03:01.489> come<00:03:01.700> out<00:03:01.970> it

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
shake hopefully it will come out it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.550 
shake hopefully it will come out it
seems<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.350> quite<00:03:03.500> strong<00:03:03.980> though<00:03:05.380> hang<00:03:06.380> on

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
these lovely roots here we'll just

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.590 
these lovely roots here we'll just
gently<00:03:17.650> tease<00:03:18.650> them<00:03:19.040> out<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.120> little<00:03:20.420> bit

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
gently tease them out just a little bit

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.420 
gently tease them out just a little bit
we<00:03:20.750> won't<00:03:20.959> do<00:03:21.560> them<00:03:21.709> too<00:03:21.950> much<00:03:22.250> because

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
we won't do them too much because

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.650 
we won't do them too much because
obviously<00:03:22.640> we<00:03:22.910> don't<00:03:23.030> want<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.269> break<00:03:23.480> them

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.750 
obviously we don't want to break them
but<00:03:23.810> if<00:03:23.900> we<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.230> move<00:03:25.100> this<00:03:25.280> side<00:03:25.519> because

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
but if we just move this side because

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.490 
but if we just move this side because
it's<00:03:25.910> been<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.420> pot<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:26.930> quite<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.200> while

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
it's been in that pot for quite a while

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.390 
it's been in that pot for quite a while
and<00:03:27.940> if<00:03:28.940> we<00:03:29.120> move<00:03:29.420> them<00:03:29.690> out<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.769> soil<00:03:31.070> out<00:03:31.250> if

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
and if we move them out the soil out if

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.190 
and if we move them out the soil out if
we<00:03:31.489> just<00:03:31.640> loosen<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.269> then<00:03:32.840> they'll<00:03:33.049> grow

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
we just loosen it then they'll grow

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.569 
we just loosen it then they'll grow
outwards<00:03:33.769> otherwise<00:03:34.070> they'll<00:03:34.310> just<00:03:34.340> keep

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
outwards otherwise they'll just keep

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.580 
outwards otherwise they'll just keep
going<00:03:34.850> round<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.329> round<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.660> round<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:38.590> pop

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
going round and round and round so pop

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.509 
going round and round and round so pop
it<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.070> soil<00:03:40.810> there<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.290> then<00:03:43.070> we'll<00:03:43.280> just

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
it in the soil there and then we'll just

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.460 
it in the soil there and then we'll just
backfill<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.329> with<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.660> rest<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> soil

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.939 
grows I'll attach it to the stick and
I'll<00:04:26.520> attach<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:27.120> stick<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.380> fencing<00:04:28.800> up

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
I'll attach the stick to the fencing up

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.100 
I'll attach the stick to the fencing up
here<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.490> will<00:04:29.580> keep<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.970> secure<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.600> then

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
here so it will keep it secure and then

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.529 
here so it will keep it secure and then
as<00:04:31.289> it<00:04:31.440> grows<00:04:31.650> I'll<00:04:32.070> train<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.789> across<00:04:33.120> almost

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
as it grows I'll train it across almost

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.790 
as it grows I'll train it across almost
probably<00:04:33.900> train<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.500> way<00:04:34.650> actually

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
probably train it that way actually

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.490 
probably train it that way actually
because<00:04:35.130> this<00:04:35.340> space<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:37.080> I'll<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:37.199> go

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
because this space and but I'll just go

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.620 
because this space and but I'll just go
and<00:04:37.620> water<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.130> now<00:04:38.310> even<00:04:38.610> though<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.180> been

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
and water it now even though it's been

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.850 
and water it now even though it's been
quite<00:04:39.930> cold<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.919> soil<00:04:41.190> is<00:04:41.430> quite<00:04:41.639> moist

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
quite cold and the soil is quite moist

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.230 
quite cold and the soil is quite moist
just<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.039> sort<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.280> take<00:04:44.550> away<00:04:44.820> any<00:04:45.000> air

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
just to sort of take away any air

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.240 
just to sort of take away any air
bubbles<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:45.750> are<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.110> there<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.620> we'll

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
bubbles that are in there and we'll

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.629 
bubbles that are in there and we'll
we'll<00:04:47.900> water<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:49.229> so<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.710> all<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.280> compost

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
we'll water it so that all the compost

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.760 
we'll water it so that all the compost
and<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.330> soil<00:04:51.570> will<00:04:51.930> get<00:04:52.110> back<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.470> where<00:04:52.620> it's

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
and the soil will get back to where it's

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.110 
and the soil will get back to where it's
supposed<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.490> let<00:04:53.610> me<00:04:53.699> just<00:04:53.820> go<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.030> get

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
supposed to so let me just go and get

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.879 
supposed to so let me just go and get
the<00:04:54.180> watering<00:04:54.630> can<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.110> I'll<00:04:55.320> just<00:04:55.530> give<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.710> a

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
the watering can so I'll just give it a

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.120 
the watering can so I'll just give it a
water<00:04:56.130> give<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.699> good<00:04:56.850> stir<00:04:57.210> water<00:04:57.889> all<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
water give it a good stir water all the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.100 
water give it a good stir water all the
way<00:04:59.250> down<00:05:01.610> there<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.789> are<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.120> once<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.600> soil

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
way down there we are and once the soil

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.320 
way down there we are and once the soil
has<00:05:04.620> once<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.190> water<00:05:05.370> has<00:05:05.550> gone<00:05:05.820> if<00:05:06.090> there's

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
has once the water has gone if there's

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.070 
has once the water has gone if there's
any<00:05:06.479> sort<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.840> dips<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.250> soil<00:05:08.690> then<00:05:09.690> any<00:05:09.960> of

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
any sort of dips in the soil then any of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.830 
any sort of dips in the soil then any of
the<00:05:10.430> soil<00:05:11.430> left<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.180> just<00:05:12.210> sort<00:05:12.449> of<00:05:12.539> fill

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the soil left you can just sort of fill

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.379 
the soil left you can just sort of fill
in<00:05:12.960> those<00:05:13.139> holes<00:05:13.280> I'll<00:05:14.280> put<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.699> grass<00:05:14.970> back

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
in those holes I'll put the grass back

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.629 
in those holes I'll put the grass back
because<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.960> is<00:05:16.380> I've<00:05:16.650> put<00:05:16.919> this<00:05:17.070> on<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.430> grass

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
because it is I've put this on the grass

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.290 
because it is I've put this on the grass
anyway<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.380> that's<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.669> hopefully

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
anyway and and that's that and hopefully

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.670 
anyway and and that's that and hopefully
it<00:05:22.229> will<00:05:22.410> sort<00:05:22.740> itself<00:05:23.190> out<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:24.750> next<00:05:25.289> year<00:05:25.500> we

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
it will sort itself out and next year we

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.339 
it will sort itself out and next year we
might<00:05:25.800> actually<00:05:26.099> have<00:05:26.490> some<00:05:26.760> mum<00:05:27.000> some<00:05:27.990> little

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
might actually have some mum some little

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.909 
might actually have some mum some little
Kiwis<00:05:28.880> which<00:05:29.880> would<00:05:30.060> be<00:05:30.210> jolly<00:05:30.479> good<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:31.080> but

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
Kiwis which would be jolly good and but

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.770
