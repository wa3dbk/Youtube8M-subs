the ground filled it up like a fourth of

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.060 
the ground filled it up like a fourth of
the<00:00:18.119> way<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.420> stuck<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> plastic<00:00:19.500> container<00:00:19.619> in

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the way I stuck a plastic container in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.640 
the way I stuck a plastic container in
there<00:00:20.539> poked<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> hole<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> top<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.439> till

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
there poked a hole in the top of it till

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
there poked a hole in the top of it till
the<00:00:22.740> water<00:00:22.920> would<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> would<00:00:24.330> stay

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the water would go in and it would stay

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.109 
the water would go in and it would stay
down<00:00:24.949> put<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> rock<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.220> top<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.820> make

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
down put a rock on top of it to make

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.759 
down put a rock on top of it to make
sure<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.420> wouldn't<00:00:27.660> come<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.320> my<00:00:28.439> fiddler

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
sure it wouldn't come up so my fiddler

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349 
sure it wouldn't come up so my fiddler
crab<00:00:29.010> might<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.490> stuck<00:00:29.789> underneath<00:00:30.090> there

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
crab might get stuck underneath there

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.530 
crab might get stuck underneath there
and<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> would<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.689> bad<00:00:31.910> but<00:00:32.910> basically<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and that would be bad but basically I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
and that would be bad but basically I
took<00:00:33.780> away<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> gravel<00:00:34.649> because<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> was

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
took away the gravel because it was

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.770 
took away the gravel because it was
really<00:00:35.489> hard<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> clean<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> wasn't

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
really hard to clean and it wasn't

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
really hard to clean and it wasn't
really<00:00:36.899> worth<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:40.340> it<00:00:41.340> allowed<00:00:41.700> me<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> add

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
really worth it and it allowed me to add

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.979 
really worth it and it allowed me to add
more<00:00:42.300> water<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:44.059> it's<00:00:45.059> easier<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.780> ten

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
more water and it's easier it's like ten

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
more water and it's easier it's like ten
times<00:00:46.170> easier<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.680> clean<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.250> he<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.430> these

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
times easier to clean and he has these

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.279 
times easier to clean and he has these
rocks<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.239> hide<00:00:48.390> around<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.110> walk

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
rocks that he can hide around and walk

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
rocks that he can hide around and walk
