00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.860 
works good but watch we have a kind of
us<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.930> curve<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:49.850> need<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.180> try<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:50.750> we

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
us a curve here so we need to try it we

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.750 
us a curve here so we need to try it we
need<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.050> warp<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.620> even<00:01:51.920> more<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.310> right<00:01:52.520> click

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
need to warp it even more so right click

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840 
need to warp it even more so right click
and<00:01:52.970> go<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.090> warp<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.720> warp<00:01:54.440> here<00:01:55.280> activates

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
and go to warp and warp here activates

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.730 
and go to warp and warp here activates
these<00:01:56.090> little<00:01:56.390> grids<00:01:56.720> which<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.290> really<00:01:57.530> cool

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
these little grids which is really cool

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.260 
these little grids which is really cool
so<00:01:58.040> what<00:01:58.190> we<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.400> do<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:58.790> grab<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
so what we can do is we can grab the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.650 
so what we can do is we can grab the
grids

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
grids

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.380 
grids
and<00:02:00.380> drag<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.250> fit<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.850> image<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.240> got

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and drag it to fit the image and you got

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.910 
and drag it to fit the image and you got
little<00:02:02.540> handles<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.440> can<00:02:03.560> pull<00:02:03.800> as

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
little handles here that you can pull as

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.470 
little handles here that you can pull as
well<00:02:04.960> do<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.080> same<00:02:06.260> at<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.410> bottom<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:08.420> you

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
well do the same at the bottom so you

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.910 
well do the same at the bottom so you
could<00:02:08.690> have<00:02:08.780> an<00:02:08.899> image<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.140> was<00:02:09.410> really

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
could have an image that was really

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.730 
could have an image that was really
really<00:02:10.040> warped<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.730> can<00:02:10.880> still<00:02:11.740> apply

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
really warped and you can still apply

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.720 
really warped and you can still apply
your<00:02:13.190> image<00:02:13.400> using<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.850> technique<00:02:15.490> okay<00:02:16.490> and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
your image using this technique okay and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
your image using this technique okay and
you<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:17.060> want<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.240> make<00:02:17.390> sure<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.690> it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you just want to make sure that it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.180 
you just want to make sure that it
doesn't<00:02:17.900> warp<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.620> too<00:02:18.740> much<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.010> wouldn't

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
doesn't warp it too much you wouldn't

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.650 
doesn't warp it too much you wouldn't
want<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.340> do<00:02:19.430> something<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.060> obviously

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
want to do something like this obviously

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.290 
want to do something like this obviously
so<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.670> looking<00:02:22.820> pretty<00:02:23.000> good

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
so that's looking pretty good

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.140 
so that's looking pretty good
so<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.620> we're<00:02:25.160> happy<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
so now we're happy with the the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.240 
so now we're happy with the the
transform<00:02:26.570> now<00:02:26.720> we<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:26.990> double<00:02:27.230> click<00:02:27.260> out

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
transform now we can double click out

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.120 
transform now we can double click out
and<00:02:28.720> we're<00:02:29.720> good<00:02:29.900> okay<00:02:30.440> we're<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.770> same<00:02:30.950> thing

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and we're good okay we're the same thing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.130 
and we're good okay we're the same thing
with<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.690> fine

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
with this with the is fine

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.840 
with this with the is fine
so<00:02:33.260> activate<00:02:34.160> when<00:02:34.250> your<00:02:34.370> spine<00:02:34.580> layers

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
so activate when your spine layers

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.180 
so activate when your spine layers
command<00:02:35.300> ctrl<00:02:35.600> T<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.870> activate<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.620> transform

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
command ctrl T to activate the transform

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.160 
command ctrl T to activate the transform
scale<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.239> down<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.450> start<00:02:38.810> off<00:02:38.959> with

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.570 

okay<00:02:43.349> now<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.560> only<00:02:43.740> thing<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.040> would<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.280> extra

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
okay now the only thing I would do extra

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.730 
okay now the only thing I would do extra
here<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.420> because<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.290> spine<00:02:46.560> it

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
here is I would because it's a spine it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.260 
here is I would because it's a spine it
should<00:02:46.920> slightly<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> little<00:02:47.880> darker

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
should slightly be to be a little darker

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.120 
should slightly be to be a little darker
come<00:02:48.510> up<00:02:48.630> here<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:50.720> image<00:02:51.720> adjustment<00:02:52.500> curves

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
come up here to image adjustment curves

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.949 
come up here to image adjustment curves
and<00:02:53.700> we're<00:02:53.849> just<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.150> drag<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.569> down

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and we're just going to drag this down

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
and we're just going to drag this down
so<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.230> makes<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.530> makes<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.010> spine<00:02:56.310> slightly

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
so it makes it makes the spine slightly

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
so it makes it makes the spine slightly
darker<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.170> perfect<00:02:58.410> okay<00:02:59.400> so

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
darker just like that perfect okay so

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.890 
darker just like that perfect okay so
our<00:02:59.640> ebook<00:02:59.850> covers<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:00.239> we<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.630> now

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
our ebook covers there we just need now

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.710 
our ebook covers there we just need now
we<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.170> need<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.319> reflection<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:05.569> what<00:03:06.569> we're

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
we just need a reflection and what we're

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440 
we just need a reflection and what we're
going<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.560> grab<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.610> second<00:03:09.180> layer<00:03:09.390> of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
going to do is grab that second layer of

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.470 
going to do is grab that second layer of
the<00:03:09.660> cover<00:03:11.120> transform<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.269> we're<00:03:12.390> always

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the cover transform so we're always

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.000 
the cover transform so we're always
using<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.840> transform<00:03:13.319> tool<00:03:13.500> we're<00:03:13.830> going<00:03:13.950> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
using the transform tool we're going to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.080 
using the transform tool we're going to
flip<00:03:14.310> vertical

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
flip vertical

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.900 
flip vertical
so<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.870> upside-down<00:03:16.140> now<00:03:16.590> hit<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:17.430> distort

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so it's upside-down now hit or distort

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.979 
so it's upside-down now hit or distort
again<00:03:20.989> grab<00:03:21.989> up<00:03:22.140> those<00:03:22.290> points<00:03:22.739> now<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.750> hard

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
again grab up those points now the hard

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.509 
again grab up those points now the hard
part<00:03:25.049> here<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.530> unfortunately<00:03:26.040> when<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.370> grab

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
part here is unfortunately when you grab

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.620 
part here is unfortunately when you grab
an<00:03:26.610> image<00:03:26.760> from<00:03:26.819> Internet<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.299> don't<00:03:27.480> have

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
an image from Internet you don't have

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.930 
an image from Internet you don't have
the<00:03:27.780> full<00:03:28.049> reflection<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.100> kind<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.790> have

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
the full reflection so you kind of have

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.140 
the full reflection so you kind of have
to<00:03:29.970> do<00:03:30.360> some<00:03:30.600> guesswork<00:03:31.019> as<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.640> angle<00:03:33.030> of

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to do some guesswork as for the angle of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.730 
to do some guesswork as for the angle of
the<00:03:33.269> reflection

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.060 

looks<00:03:41.340> okay<00:03:42.470> alright<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> like<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
looks okay alright I like that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.150 
looks okay alright I like that
now<00:03:44.250> I'm<00:03:44.340> going<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.520> merge<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.030> two<00:03:46.160> reflected

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
now I'm going to merge the two reflected

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.120 
now I'm going to merge the two reflected
layers<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.700> I'm<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:47.940> grab<00:03:48.120> my<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.950> one

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
layers so I'm going to grab my this one

to merge okay now what I want to do is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.010 
to merge okay now what I want to do is
add<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.980> mask<00:03:56.310> around<00:03:57.180> my<00:03:57.270> gradient<00:03:57.600> tool<00:03:57.810> my

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
add a mask around my gradient tool my

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.570 
add a mask around my gradient tool my
try<00:03:58.170> got<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.350> black<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.680> white<00:03:58.770> gradient<00:03:58.830> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
try got a black to white gradient and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.440 
try got a black to white gradient and
simply<00:04:00.090> add<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.450> nice<00:04:01.850> faded<00:04:02.850> gradient<00:04:03.240> like

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
simply add a nice faded gradient like

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.150 
simply add a nice faded gradient like
that<00:04:03.720> now<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.380> problem<00:04:04.740> is<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.130> our

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
that now the problem is that our

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.520 
that now the problem is that our
original<00:04:05.730> gradient<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.660> showing<00:04:07.140> through

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
original gradient is is showing through

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.800 
original gradient is is showing through
so<00:04:08.310> what<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.460> need<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.670> do<00:04:08.850> is<00:04:09.000> grab<00:04:09.120> my<00:04:09.390> original

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
so what I need to do is grab my original

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.580 
so what I need to do is grab my original
image<00:04:10.050> of<00:04:10.460> my<00:04:11.460> ebook<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:13.020> want<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.260> delete
