00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.940
 The first thing is to look for the seam of the sleeve 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.040
 and we iron up 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.360
 without reaching the edge or the fist 

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:23.915
 We turn around and do the same 

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:33.053
 We take the hose holder 

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:36.653
 and we put the sleeve through the top 

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:38.993
 and iron 

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:46.233
 We put the fists 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.420
 and we are rotating them 

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:55.548
 marking the tweezers 

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:10.097
 We do the same operation with the other sleeve 

00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:58.121
 We go with the neck 

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:01.573
 We will iron bent 

00:02:01.573 --> 00:02:04.733
 Giving a fast pass 

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:12.753
 We iron the right front 

00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:15.693
 Skirting buttons 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.680
 Let's not forget the seams 

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:37.417
 We continue with the shoulders 

00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:53.574
 and the left front 

00:02:57.055 --> 00:03:01.195
 And finally 

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:04.295
 The back part 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.560
 The biggest but the easiest 

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.273
 And it's already !!!!!!!
