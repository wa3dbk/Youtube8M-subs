00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
or panel I'm pretty sure is working I've

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.479 
or panel I'm pretty sure is working I've
been<00:02:25.610> running<00:02:25.900> different<00:02:26.900> power<00:02:27.140> things<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
been running different power things and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.289 
been running different power things and
stuff<00:02:28.760> oops<00:02:29.360> um<00:02:29.629> boat<00:02:30.049> pulled<00:02:30.709> my<00:02:31.090> laptop<00:02:32.090> off

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
stuff oops um boat pulled my laptop off

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.660 
stuff oops um boat pulled my laptop off
the<00:02:32.450> shelf<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.829> we<00:02:33.980> reading<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.549> there

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the shelf here that we reading in there

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.649 
the shelf here that we reading in there
again<00:02:36.220> yeah<00:02:37.220> we<00:02:37.370> were<00:02:37.489> running<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.849> TV<00:02:38.299> we<00:02:38.510> had

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
again yeah we were running the TV we had

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.559 
again yeah we were running the TV we had
the<00:02:38.810> light<00:02:38.959> on<00:02:39.230> we've<00:02:39.890> been<00:02:40.069> with<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.790> laptop

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the light on we've been with the laptop

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.970 
the light on we've been with the laptop
plugged<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.200> we<00:02:45.590> got<00:02:45.620> another

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
plugged in so and we got another

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.589 
plugged in so and we got another
inverter<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> show<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:47.420> other

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
inverter I want to show you this other

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.990 
inverter I want to show you this other
inverter<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.290> okay

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
inverter here okay

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.250 
inverter here okay
now<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> don't<00:02:50.269> know<00:02:50.420> how<00:02:50.569> well<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:50.989> it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
now I don't know how well you can see it

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.039 
now I don't know how well you can see it
but<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.189> plug<00:02:52.400> in<00:02:52.609> bar<00:02:52.939> it's<00:02:53.659> got<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> little

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
but it's a plug in bar it's got a little

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.899 
but it's a plug in bar it's got a little
fan<00:02:54.409> right<00:02:54.920> here<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:56.620> cool<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.609> we've<00:02:58.730> got

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
fan right here to cool it and we've got

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.280 
fan right here to cool it and we've got
that<00:02:59.090> plugged<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.480> then<00:02:59.629> we've<00:02:59.750> got<00:02:59.870> our<00:02:59.900> cord

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
that plugged in then we've got our cord

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.619 
that plugged in then we've got our cord
here<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.799> TV<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.900> powers<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:04.299> base<00:03:05.299> box

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
here for the TV that powers my base box

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.240 
here for the TV that powers my base box
there<00:03:05.900> for<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.260> speakers<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.069> why<00:03:07.190> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
there for the speakers so that's why I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.410 
there for the speakers so that's why I
don't<00:03:07.370> have<00:03:07.489> it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
don't have it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.030 
don't have it
particularly<00:03:09.049> plugged<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:09.769> it's<00:03:09.889> only

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
particularly plugged in but it's only

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.660 
particularly plugged in but it's only
150<00:03:10.579> watts<00:03:11.000> okay<00:03:11.840> I'm<00:03:12.530> 50<00:03:12.920> Watson<00:03:13.370> works

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
150 watts okay I'm 50 Watson works

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.369 
150 watts okay I'm 50 Watson works
absolutely<00:03:14.329> great<00:03:14.569> up<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.900> now<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.049> we're

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
absolutely great up to now so we're

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.390 
absolutely great up to now so we're
gonna<00:03:15.440> see<00:03:15.739> we're<00:03:15.889> gonna<00:03:16.010> let<00:03:16.129> you<00:03:16.250> know

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
gonna see we're gonna let you know

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.339 
gonna see we're gonna let you know
because<00:03:17.090> really<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.450> don't<00:03:17.599> need<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> big

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
because really you don't need a big

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.500 
because really you don't need a big
inverter<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.400> power<00:03:19.639> some<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> basic

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
inverter to power some of the basic

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.660 
inverter to power some of the basic
stuffs<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.920> truck<00:03:22.159> you<00:03:22.310> know<00:03:22.400> for

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
stuffs and in the truck you know for

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.899 
stuffs and in the truck you know for
laptop<00:03:23.060> etc<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.290> had<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.620> 400<00:03:25.099> watt<00:03:25.519> one

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
laptop etc and I had that 400 watt one

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.949 
laptop etc and I had that 400 watt one
and<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:28.370> needs<00:03:28.669> more<00:03:28.849> power<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.449> drains<00:03:29.720> more

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and it needs more power it drains more

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.099 
and it needs more power it drains more
power<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.530> operate<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.699> and<00:03:32.239> therefore<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
power to operate it and therefore the

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.390 
power to operate it and therefore the
alarms<00:03:33.440> were<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.620> off<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> little<00:03:34.250> bit

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
alarms were going off a little bit

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.559 
alarms were going off a little bit
quicker<00:03:34.579> so<00:03:34.730> I'm<00:03:34.819> hoping<00:03:35.030> with<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.299> smaller

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
quicker so I'm hoping with this smaller

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.689 
quicker so I'm hoping with this smaller
inverter<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.379> going<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.250> work<00:03:37.370> better<00:03:37.549> and

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
inverter it's going to work better and

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.280 
inverter it's going to work better and
work<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.120> conjunction<00:03:38.359> with<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:40.870> solar<00:03:41.870> panel

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
work in conjunction with the solar panel

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.409 
work in conjunction with the solar panel
