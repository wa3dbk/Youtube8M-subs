00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
that removes hair from the roots so

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.859 
that removes hair from the roots so
similar<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.730> waxing<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.269> that<00:00:28.420> kind<00:00:28.630> of<00:00:28.660> thing

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
similar to waxing and that kind of thing

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.019 
similar to waxing and that kind of thing
but<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.170> does<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.350> by<00:00:29.740> having<00:00:30.039> lots<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.910> lots

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
but it does it by having lots and lots

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.570 
but it does it by having lots and lots
of<00:00:31.180> little<00:00:31.390> tweezers<00:00:31.960> so<00:00:32.290> yes<00:00:32.500> it<00:00:32.769> is<00:00:32.920> painful

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
of little tweezers so yes it is painful

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.580 
of little tweezers so yes it is painful
but<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.330> removes<00:00:34.570> her<00:00:34.840> from<00:00:35.050> the<00:00:35.140> root<00:00:35.290> so<00:00:35.500> the

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
but it removes her from the root so the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.470 
but it removes her from the root so the
results<00:00:35.980> are<00:00:36.160> far<00:00:36.399> more<00:00:36.460> long-lasting<00:00:36.820> and

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
results are far more long-lasting and

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
results are far more long-lasting and

used this on other parts of my body to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100 
used this on other parts of my body to
test<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.490> out<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.090> only<00:01:31.299> kind<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.630> upper<00:01:31.900> part

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
test it out and only kind of upper part

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.719

of<00:01:32.170> my<00:01:32.259> leg<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.799> kind<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.070> thing<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.640> I

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
of my leg and that kind of thing and I

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.850 
of my leg and that kind of thing and I
really<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.479> this<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.020> basically

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
really really like this and basically

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.149 
really really like this and basically
how<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.369> different<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:38.259> get

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
how this is different is that you get

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.100 
how this is different is that you get
your<00:01:39.220> epilator<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.360> also<00:01:40.540> get<00:01:40.900> this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
your epilator and you also get this

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.569 
your epilator and you also get this
brush<00:01:41.409> head<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:41.829> it's<00:01:41.950> basically<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.430> a

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
brush head so it's basically like a

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.399 
brush head so it's basically like a
Clarisonic<00:01:43.210> full<00:01:43.420> body<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.930> what<00:01:44.079> this<00:01:44.229> is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
Clarisonic full body and what this is

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.160 
Clarisonic full body and what this is
great<00:01:44.650> for<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.189> fact<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:46.659> helps<00:01:47.049> to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
great for is the fact that it helps to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.929 
great for is the fact that it helps to
prevent<00:01:47.320> ingrown<00:01:47.619> hairs<00:01:48.070> quite<00:01:48.340> exfoliating

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
prevent ingrown hairs quite exfoliating

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.310 
prevent ingrown hairs quite exfoliating
the<00:01:48.970> skin<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:49.540> when<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.869> remove<00:01:49.990> hair

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
the skin because when you remove hair

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.050 
the skin because when you remove hair
from<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.590> root<00:01:50.770> with<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.159> wax<00:01:51.399> replica<00:01:52.000> or

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
from the root with you wax replica or

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.600 
from the root with you wax replica or
whatever<00:01:52.329> you<00:01:52.420> do<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:53.200> very<00:01:53.680> difficult<00:01:54.189> to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
whatever you do it's very difficult to

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.760 
whatever you do it's very difficult to
not<00:01:54.759> get<00:01:54.939> ingrown<00:01:55.240> hairs<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:56.290> I'm<00:01:56.470> gonna<00:01:56.590> open

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
not get ingrown hairs so I'm gonna open

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.319 
not get ingrown hairs so I'm gonna open

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
the kit and just talk you through how it

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.649 
the kit and just talk you through how it
works<00:01:59.189> so<00:02:00.189> what<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.490> get<00:02:00.670> with<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.479> get

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
works so what you get with it is you get

golf<00:02:25.599> anywhere<00:02:25.959> like<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.409> they're

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
golf anywhere like that and they're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.589 
golf anywhere like that and they're
about<00:02:26.739> two<00:02:27.069> three<00:02:27.310> pounds<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.090> need<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
about two three pounds so you need a

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.990 
about two three pounds so you need a
different<00:02:28.989> adapter<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.739> make<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.040> work<00:02:30.250> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
different adapter to make it work and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940 
different adapter to make it work and
then<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.299> just<00:02:31.510> plug<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.680> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
then you just plug it in like that and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.100 
then you just plug it in like that and
plug<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> into<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.760> mains<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.780> UK

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
plug it into the mains in the UK

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.420 
plug it into the mains in the UK
obviously<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:35.650> you're<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.920> country<00:02:36.280> where

obviously if you're in a country where

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.430 
obviously if you're in a country where
that<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.150> electric<00:02:37.989> shock<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.290> that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that is the electric shock is that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.780 
that is the electric shock is that
you've<00:02:38.560> got<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.920> you'll<00:02:39.099> be<00:02:39.190> fine<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.640> won't

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
have a problem at all then it comes with

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.240 
have a problem at all then it comes with
some<00:02:43.000> attachment<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.930> here<00:02:44.230> which<00:02:44.709> are<00:02:45.040> the

protective case for the Epley for the

protective case for the Epley for the
exfoliating<00:02:48.970> heads<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.750> kind<00:02:49.989> of

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
exfoliating heads and the kind of

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.420 
exfoliating heads and the kind of
smaller<00:02:51.780> little<00:02:52.980> attachments<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.099> won't<00:02:54.280> open

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
smaller little attachments I won't open

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.770 
smaller little attachments I won't open
this<00:02:54.700> because<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.150> can<00:02:55.299> see<00:02:55.450> them<00:02:55.629> like<00:02:55.750> this

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
this because you can see them like this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
this because you can see them like this
but<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.440> smaller<00:02:56.769> little<00:02:57.129> attachments<00:02:57.819> for

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
but the smaller little attachments for

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.180 
but the smaller little attachments for
smaller<00:02:58.299> areas<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.200> if<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.379> were<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.739> apply<00:02:59.859> on

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
smaller areas so if you were to apply on

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.680 
smaller areas so if you were to apply on
your<00:03:00.220> face<00:03:00.519> or<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.849> kind<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.090> thing<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.450> never

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
your face or that kind of thing I never

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.150 
your face or that kind of thing I never
use<00:03:01.900> these<00:03:02.079> because<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.500> don't<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.859> to<00:03:02.950> lay<00:03:03.040> it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
use these because I don't have to lay it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.670 
use these because I don't have to lay it
on<00:03:03.280> my<00:03:03.430> face<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:04.660> tend<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.260> use<00:03:05.379> those

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
on my face so I don't tend to use those

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.640 
on my face so I don't tend to use those
but<00:03:06.340> I'm<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> show<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.359> how<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.140> works

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
but I'm going to show you how it works

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
but I'm going to show you how it works
and<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.519> basic<00:03:10.209> idea<00:03:10.420> with<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:12.519> is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
and the basic idea with it is this is

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.520 
and the basic idea with it is this is
the<00:03:12.819> epilator<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.660> looks<00:03:13.930> very<00:03:14.290> very<00:03:14.410> similar

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the epilator it looks very very similar

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.770 
the epilator it looks very very similar
to<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.099> previous<00:03:15.310> one<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.819> can<00:03:16.150> use<00:03:16.329> this<00:03:16.540> on

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
to the previous one you can use this on

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.020 
to the previous one you can use this on
wet<00:03:16.840> skin<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.769> dry<00:03:17.919> skin<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.370> prefer<00:03:18.669> doing<00:03:18.849> on

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
wet skin and dry skin I prefer doing on

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.240 
wet skin and dry skin I prefer doing on
dry<00:03:19.239> skin<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.660> because<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.169> feel<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:21.130> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
dry skin just because I feel like in the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.979 
dry skin just because I feel like in the
bath<00:03:21.430> or<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.760> shower<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.269> never<00:03:22.510> really<00:03:22.810> get

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
bath or in the shower I never really get

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.629 
bath or in the shower I never really get
every<00:03:23.349> tiny<00:03:23.650> little<00:03:23.829> hair<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.280> find<00:03:24.519> it

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
every tiny little hair and I find it

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.970 
every tiny little hair and I find it
easier<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:24.940> wet<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.419> dry<00:03:25.450> skin<00:03:25.989> but<00:03:26.500> do<00:03:26.709> note

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
easier on wet on dry skin but do note

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.530 
easier on wet on dry skin but do note
that<00:03:27.010> if<00:03:27.310> you're<00:03:27.459> doing<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.730> wet<00:03:27.940> skin<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.269> is<00:03:28.389> a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
that if you're doing a wet skin it is a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.940 
that if you're doing a wet skin it is a
little<00:03:28.720> bit<00:03:28.870> less<00:03:28.989> painful<00:03:29.470> because<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.769> the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
little bit less painful because of the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.559 
little bit less painful because of the
heat<00:03:30.250> your<00:03:30.519> pores<00:03:30.760> are<00:03:30.940> kind<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.269> bit<00:03:31.389> more

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
heat your pores are kind of a bit more

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.680 
heat your pores are kind of a bit more
susceptible<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.370> using<00:03:33.669> it<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.540> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
susceptible so I like using it like that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.229 
susceptible so I like using it like that
it<00:03:34.930> comes<00:03:35.230> with<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.950> big<00:03:36.280> flashlight<00:03:36.730> which

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
it comes with the big flashlight which

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.780 
it comes with the big flashlight which
is<00:03:37.450> fantastic<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.370> means<00:03:39.579> that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
is fantastic because that means that

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.400 
is fantastic because that means that
when<00:03:39.910> you're<00:03:40.060> holding<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.569> if<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.109> hold<00:03:41.260> it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
when you're holding it if you hold it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.670 
when you're holding it if you hold it
like<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:42.359> it<00:03:43.359> casts<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.780> shadow<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.560> you're

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
like this it casts a shadow so you're

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.379 
like this it casts a shadow so you're
casting<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> shadow<00:03:45.130> on<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.760> area<00:03:46.120> you're

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
casting a shadow on the area you're

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.879 
casting a shadow on the area you're
trying<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.720> regulate<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.560> actually

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
trying to regulate that this actually

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.159 
trying to regulate that this actually
comes<00:03:48.099> with<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.340> flash<00:03:48.579> torch<00:03:49.239> thing<00:03:49.720> that's

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
comes with a flash torch thing that's

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.449 
comes with a flash torch thing that's
really<00:03:50.560> really<00:03:50.709> bright<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.160> I'm<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
really really bright so I'm going to

00:03:51.459 --> 00:04:05.680 
really really bright so I'm going to
turn<00:03:51.609> it<00:03:51.790> on<00:03:51.819> just<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.150> show<00:03:52.239> you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.390 

so<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:07.260> can<00:04:07.410> really<00:04:07.680> see<00:04:07.860> what<00:04:08.040> you're<00:04:08.130> doing

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
so you can really see what you're doing

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.730 
so you can really see what you're doing
which<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.670> fantastic<00:04:08.850> then<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> also<00:04:10.290> think

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
which is fantastic then I also think

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.320 
which is fantastic then I also think
that<00:04:10.860> it's<00:04:11.160> great<00:04:11.670> because<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:12.060> got<00:04:12.180> two

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
that it's great because it's got two

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.700 
that it's great because it's got two
different<00:04:12.450> settings<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.080> it's<00:04:13.230> got<00:04:13.350> setting

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
different settings so it's got setting

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.440 
different settings so it's got setting
one<00:04:13.980> which<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.580> one<00:04:14.850> right<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.180> and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
one which is this one right here and

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.540 
one which is this one right here and
then<00:04:15.960> setting<00:04:16.380> two<00:04:16.590> which<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.310> right

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
then setting two which is that one right

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.920 
then setting two which is that one right
there<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.310> kind<00:04:20.580> of<00:04:20.640> see<00:04:21.120> what<00:04:21.600> pain

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
there and you can kind of see what pain

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.660 
there and you can kind of see what pain
level<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.650> tolerate<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:23.100> always<00:04:23.370> look<00:04:23.550> for

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
level you can tolerate I always look for

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.540 
level you can tolerate I always look for
the<00:04:23.700> highest<00:04:23.760> one<00:04:24.180> because<00:04:24.480> I'm<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.750> bit<00:04:25.550> brave

just turn it on you get the light and
the<00:05:11.940> vibration<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.840> can<00:05:12.990> just<00:05:13.170> go<00:05:13.320> over

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
the vibration so you can just go over

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
every area really carefully and it will

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.980 
every area really carefully and it will
really<00:05:16.620> help<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.220> exfoliate<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.510> smooth<00:05:18.810> out

really help to exfoliate and smooth out
the<00:05:19.050> area<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.040> do<00:05:20.160> think<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.880> really

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.300 
the area so I do think this is a really
really<00:05:21.390> good<00:05:21.600> epilator<00:05:22.020> but<00:05:22.560> as<00:05:22.740> I<00:05:22.920> said<00:05:23.100> I

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
really good epilator but as I said I

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.310 
really good epilator but as I said I
love<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.730> previous<00:05:24.180> one<00:05:24.390> I<00:05:24.420> think<00:05:24.600> born<00:05:24.990> do

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320

that they're the most reliable and they

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.720 
that they're the most reliable and they
work<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.290> best<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.980> love<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.400> design<00:05:35.700> of

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
little addition I think it just really

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.080 
little addition I think it just really
sets<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.290> apart<00:05:43.320> in<00:05:43.920> terms<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.520> price<00:05:44.670> it's<00:05:44.940> not

the<00:05:45.180> cheapest<00:05:45.630> it's<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.110> hundred<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.680> fifty

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
the cheapest it's a hundred and fifty

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.410 
the cheapest it's a hundred and fifty

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
certain places online as I said it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.010 
certain places online as I said it
hasn't<00:05:52.890> launched<00:05:53.370> yet<00:05:53.460> but<00:05:54.240> when<00:05:54.420> it<00:05:54.540> does<00:05:54.720> its

hasn't launched yet but when it does its

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.530 
hasn't launched yet but when it does its
retail<00:05:55.380> price<00:05:55.590> will<00:05:55.890> be<00:05:56.000> 150<00:05:57.000> pounds<00:05:57.270> so<00:05:57.390> it's

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
retail price will be 150 pounds so it's

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.870 
retail price will be 150 pounds so it's
not<00:05:57.690> cheap<00:05:58.050> but<00:05:58.530> if<00:05:58.920> you<00:05:59.130> calculate<00:05:59.640> how<00:05:59.760> much

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
not cheap but if you calculate how much

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.280 
not cheap but if you calculate how much
it<00:06:00.030> would<00:06:00.120> cost<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.480> keep<00:06:00.720> having<00:06:00.900> and

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
it would cost you to keep having and

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.310 
it would cost you to keep having and
going<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.550> get<00:06:02.670> wax<00:06:03.000> treatments<00:06:03.840> on<00:06:03.930> your<00:06:04.140> legs

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
going to get wax treatments on your legs

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.700 
going to get wax treatments on your legs
then<00:06:04.950> you<00:06:05.370> are<00:06:05.700> saving<00:06:06.210> money<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.720> as<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.500> said

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
then you are saving money and as I said

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.380 
then you are saving money and as I said
you<00:06:07.950> can<00:06:08.190> use<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.580> anywhere<00:06:08.820> you<00:06:09.030> want<00:06:09.060> your

anywhere like that

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.260 
anywhere like that
I<00:06:13.080> only<00:06:13.530> ever<00:06:13.680> use<00:06:13.979> it<00:06:14.130> on<00:06:14.190> my<00:06:14.310> legs<00:06:14.550> because<00:06:14.970> I

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
I only ever use it on my legs because I

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.630 
I only ever use it on my legs because I
don't<00:06:15.900> like<00:06:16.440> doing<00:06:16.470> under<00:06:17.070> my<00:06:17.100> arms<00:06:17.490> and

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
don't like doing under my arms and

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.190 
don't like doing under my arms and
sometimes<00:06:18.060> I<00:06:18.150> kind<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:18.419> top<00:06:18.630> up<00:06:18.810> on<00:06:18.960> my<00:06:19.050> bikini

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440 
sometimes I kind of top up on my bikini
area<00:06:19.770> but<00:06:20.280> I<00:06:20.310> do<00:06:20.430> definitely<00:06:20.880> think<00:06:21.210> this<00:06:21.300> is<00:06:21.419> a

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
area but I do definitely think this is a

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.300 
area but I do definitely think this is a
really<00:06:21.840> really<00:06:22.020> fantastic<00:06:22.229> epilator<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.250> I'd

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.030 
you would go out and purchase this when
it<00:06:27.210> comes<00:06:27.360> out<00:06:27.570> because<00:06:27.810> of<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.350> exfoliating

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040
