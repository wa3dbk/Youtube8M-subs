00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
and then this is I think it's an a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.490 
and then this is I think it's an a
seventh<00:03:47.470> chord<00:03:48.100> I'm<00:03:48.910> not<00:03:49.090> sure<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:49.660> it's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
seventh chord I'm not sure but it's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.440 
seventh chord I'm not sure but it's
certainly<00:03:50.890> an<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.810> you're<00:03:53.170> going<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.350> do<00:03:54.450> the
