00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
too much but I'm the reason that is is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.849 
too much but I'm the reason that is is
because<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> got<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> evo<00:00:28.470> LTE<00:00:29.539> the

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
because when I got the evo LTE the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.590 
because when I got the evo LTE the
screencast<00:00:31.859> app<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> used<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> record<00:00:32.969> my

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
screencast app but I used to record my

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.860 
screencast app but I used to record my
screen<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.640> working<00:00:36.059> correctly<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
screen was not working correctly and I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.670 
screen was not working correctly and I
couldn't<00:00:37.140> figure<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.500> who<00:00:37.649> did<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> work<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
couldn't figure out who did the work so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.720 
couldn't figure out who did the work so
