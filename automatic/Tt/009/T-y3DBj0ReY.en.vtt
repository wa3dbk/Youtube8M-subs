thing I just noticed right now is that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.570 
thing I just noticed right now is that
the<00:02:08.750> purple<00:02:09.410> house<00:02:09.560> has<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> new<00:02:10.130> building

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
animation whereas it never had one

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.949 
animation whereas it never had one
before<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:14.000> only<00:02:14.209> person<00:02:14.510> who<00:02:14.630> could<00:02:14.780> go

before the only person who could go

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.800 
before the only person who could go
there<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.380> phat<00:02:15.620> Tony<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.340> bury<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.420> body<00:02:17.600> or
