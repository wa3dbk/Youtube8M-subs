at<00:00:27.000> once<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.539> ridiculous<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.310> suggest

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
at once which is ridiculous so suggest

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.229 
at once which is ridiculous so suggest
that<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.710> tactical<00:00:31.710> insertion<00:00:32.239> if

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that you use on tactical insertion if

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.790 
that you use on tactical insertion if
you're<00:00:33.420> doing<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.290> test<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> out

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you're doing this to just test it out

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.299 
you're doing this to just test it out
because<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> takes<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.430> practice<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> we'll

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
because it takes some practice so we'll

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.119 
because it takes some practice so we'll
wait<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.640> him<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> come<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.329> keytek<00:00:40.129> so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
care package comes out faster than

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.270 
care package comes out faster than
normal<00:01:54.350> which<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.560> hint<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> did<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
normal which is a hint that you did it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
normal which is a hint that you did it
right<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:59.009> you'll<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:02.689> you<00:02:03.689> got<00:02:03.840> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
right so there you'll do that you got it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.530 
right so there you'll do that you got it
I<00:02:04.200> got<00:02:04.290> predator<00:02:04.920> missile<00:02:05.219> too<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.640> notice

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
I got predator missile too but notice

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.499 
I got predator missile too but notice
it's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.810> mo<00:02:07.140> sometimes<00:02:08.099> with<00:02:08.520> ammo<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it's a mo sometimes with ammo you have

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's a mo sometimes with ammo you have
to<00:02:09.720> kill<00:02:10.050> yourself<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:11.340> throw<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> grenade

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
to kill yourself just throw a grenade

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.700 
to kill yourself just throw a grenade
blow<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:12.840> let<00:02:12.930> anyone<00:02:13.170> else

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
blow up don't let anyone else

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.600 
blow up don't let anyone else
a<00:02:13.740> kill<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.500> you'll<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> care

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
a kill on you and you'll get the care

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.570 
a kill on you and you'll get the care
package<00:02:18.030> after<00:02:18.330> dying<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.440> sometimes<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
package after dying but sometimes it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
package after dying but sometimes it
works<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:21.990> have<00:02:22.230> another<00:02:22.410> care

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
works so there I have another care

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.130 
works so there I have another care
package<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> they<00:02:24.300> are<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.630> one<00:02:24.840> more<00:02:24.960> time

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
package so they are all do one more time

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.430 
package so they are all do one more time
for<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.410> guys<00:02:25.560> over<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:27.200> take<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.320> my

gun<00:02:28.470> hold<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> care<00:02:29.430> package<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:30.000> double

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
gun hold the care package down double

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.760 
gun hold the care package down double
tap<00:02:31.080> didn't<00:02:31.530> work<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.290> takes<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:34.740> of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
tap didn't work so it takes a lot of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.350 
tap didn't work so it takes a lot of
getting<00:02:34.950> used<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.270> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
getting used to so you have to have it

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:46.000 
getting used to so you have to have it
out<00:02:36.620> climb<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.280> goes<00:02:39.590> I'll<00:02:40.590> throw<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420 

wait<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> come<00:02:47.490> down<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.220> got<00:02:50.400> a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
wait for it to come down now you got a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.420 
wait for it to come down now you got a
care<00:02:50.640> package<00:02:51.140> predator<00:02:52.140> missile<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:56.250> there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
care package predator missile so there

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.690 
care package predator missile so there
you<00:02:56.460> guys<00:02:56.700> go<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> we'll<00:02:58.800> use<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.280> predator

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
you guys go so we'll use the predator

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.600 
you guys go so we'll use the predator
missile<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.060> get<00:03:00.210> from<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:04.520> as<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.760> katek<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
missile I get from this as I katek and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.860 
missile I get from this as I katek and
here's<00:03:08.610> what<00:03:08.760> happens<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.330> just<00:03:09.600> throw

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
here's what happens if you just throw

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.360 
here's what happens if you just throw
the<00:03:09.990> care<00:03:10.200> package<00:03:10.590> instead<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.100> doing<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the care package instead of doing the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.180 
the care package instead of doing the
glitch<00:03:11.670> each<00:03:12.180> care<00:03:12.840> package<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.320> get<00:03:13.470> notice

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
glitch each care package you get notice

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.920 
glitch each care package you get notice
you<00:03:14.340> don't<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> care<00:03:15.060> package<00:03:15.240> again<00:03:15.570> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
you don't get a care package again and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.650 
you don't get a care package again and
you'll<00:03:16.320> have<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> redo<00:03:17.010> all<00:03:17.250> those<00:03:17.460> steps<00:03:17.760> so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you'll have to redo all those steps so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.150 
you'll have to redo all those steps so
you'll<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.990> get<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.350> four<00:03:19.680> kill<00:03:19.860> streak

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
you'll have to get the four kill streak

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.140 
you'll have to get the four kill streak
of<00:03:20.400> unless<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.600> hard<00:03:21.870> line<00:03:22.020> on<00:03:22.730> see<00:03:23.730> that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
of unless you have hard line on see that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.060 
of unless you have hard line on see that
I<00:03:24.420> will<00:03:24.930> not<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> care<00:03:25.560> package<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.770> is

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
I will not get a care package so that is

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.640 
I will not get a care package so that is
the<00:03:29.370> basics<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.540> glitch<00:03:30.810> I'll<00:03:31.140> now<00:03:31.320> switch

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the basics of the glitch I'll now switch

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.080 
the basics of the glitch I'll now switch
to<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:32.630> controller<00:03:33.630> view<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.730> what<00:03:35.730> I'm<00:03:35.820> doing

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
to a controller view of what I'm doing

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.490 
to a controller view of what I'm doing
on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.270> controller<00:03:36.720> while<00:03:36.990> I'm<00:03:37.110> doing<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
on the controller while I'm doing the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.750 
on the controller while I'm doing the
glitch<00:03:37.770> um<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:40.230> yeah<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:41.160> basically<00:03:41.370> what

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
glitch um so yeah that's basically what

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.040 
glitch um so yeah that's basically what
it<00:03:41.790> looks<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.960> as

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
it looks like and you can do that as

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.780 
it looks like and you can do that as
many<00:03:43.170> times<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.280> hope<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.760> enjoy<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:45.090> guys

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
many times so I hope you enjoy that guys

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.450 
many times so I hope you enjoy that guys
all<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:47.940> here's<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.450> controller<00:03:49.080> view<00:03:49.460> so

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
all right here's the controller view so

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.430 
all right here's the controller view so
there<00:03:50.670> I'm<00:03:50.880> holding<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.390> down<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.840> pressing

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
there I'm holding it down I'm pressing

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.080 
there I'm holding it down I'm pressing
the<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:53.070> I'm<00:03:53.250> double<00:03:53.580> tapping<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:55.550> now<00:03:56.550> you

know I'm just walking around and I'm
going<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.830> throw<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> care<00:03:59.280> package<00:04:00.650> um<00:04:02.810> there

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
going to throw the care package um there

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.530 
going to throw the care package um there
I'm<00:04:03.930> double<00:04:04.200> tapping<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:05.580> that's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
I'm double tapping and that's

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.540 
I'm double tapping and that's
essentially<00:04:07.080> all<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.590> have<00:04:07.740> to<00:04:07.890> do<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.370> be

essentially all you have to do to be
able<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.790> do<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.060> glitch<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.090> very

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
able to do this glitch it's a very

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:21.770 
able to do this glitch it's a very
simple<00:04:12.600> um<00:04:13.220> little<00:04:14.220> witch

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
