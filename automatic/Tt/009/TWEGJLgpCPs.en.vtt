if<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:05.520> want<00:00:05.760> to<00:00:05.850> create<00:00:06.030> a<00:00:06.270> mirror<00:00:06.780> of<00:00:06.960> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
if I want to create a mirror of a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.500 
if I want to create a mirror of a
sheetmetal<00:00:07.680> part<00:00:08.309> off<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:10.550> one<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.850> faces

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
sheetmetal part off of one of the faces

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.880 
sheetmetal part off of one of the faces
of<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.990> sheet<00:00:13.170> metal<00:00:13.200> part<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.830> is

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
of the sheet metal part this is

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.010 
of the sheet metal part this is
relatively<00:00:14.250> straightforward<00:00:14.640> if<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.540> want<00:00:15.840> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
relatively straightforward if I want a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.120 
relatively straightforward if I want a
merged<00:00:16.380> part<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.580> flatten<00:00:18.860> so<00:00:19.860> if<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
merged part that I can flatten so if I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.030 
merged part that I can flatten so if I
choose<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.700> mirror<00:00:20.910> tool<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.770> for<00:00:22.770> example

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
choose the mirror tool and for example

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.150 
choose the mirror tool and for example
choose<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.579> flat<00:00:23.820> face<00:00:24.529> which<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.560> required

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
choose this flat face which is required

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
choose this flat face which is required
for<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.579> sheetmetal<00:00:26.820> part<00:00:27.270> for<00:00:27.989> example<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.500> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
for a sheetmetal part for example if I

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.970 
for a sheetmetal part for example if I
try<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.890> choose<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.149> these<00:00:30.300> planes<00:00:30.980> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
try to choose one of these planes this

feature<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> give<00:00:33.360> me<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.570> error<00:00:36.140> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
feature is going to give me an error so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.610 
feature is going to give me an error so
with<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.500> mirror<00:00:37.739> tool<00:00:38.039> I<00:00:39.019> can<00:00:40.019> only<00:00:40.230> mirror

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
with the mirror tool I can only mirror

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
with the mirror tool I can only mirror
the<00:00:40.769> body<00:00:41.390> about<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.449> face

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
own faces you see this error that I'm

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.690 
own faces you see this error that I'm
getting<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> try<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.440> select<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:58.700> so

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
getting when I try to select this so

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.060 
getting when I try to select this so
once<00:00:59.880> again<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.390> created<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.110> quarter<00:01:01.830> of<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
once again if I created a quarter of a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
once again if I created a quarter of a
part<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.520> half<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.000> part<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> wanted

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
part or half of a part and wanted

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.890 
part or half of a part and wanted
emerged<00:01:04.350> result<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> would<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.660> fairly

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
emerged result this would be fairly

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.210 
emerged result this would be fairly
useful<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> whole<00:01:09.479> part<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:10.070> half<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
useful as I get a whole part or half of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.030 
useful as I get a whole part or half of
a<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.530> go<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
a part now and I could even go on to

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:27.469 
a part now and I could even go on to
mirror<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> again<00:01:21.800> across<00:01:22.800> this<00:01:23.300> phase<00:01:26.479> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
mirror this again across this phase and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.120 
mirror this again across this phase and
so<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> said<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.380> had<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> quarter<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so like I said if I had a quarter of a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.790 
so like I said if I had a quarter of a
part<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:30.600> easily<00:01:30.840> create<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> whole<00:01:31.530> part

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
part I can easily create the whole part

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.389 
part I can easily create the whole part
merge<00:01:32.640> together<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.190> unsuppressed<00:01:38.190> a

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
merge together and when I unsuppressed a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.960 
merge together and when I unsuppressed a
flat<00:01:38.610> pattern<00:01:39.800> it's<00:01:40.800> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> contain<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
flat pattern it's going to contain that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.160 
flat pattern it's going to contain that
entire<00:01:42.710> geometry<00:01:44.210> or<00:01:45.210> I'll<00:01:45.360> contain<00:01:45.660> all<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
entire geometry or I'll contain all the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.770 
entire geometry or I'll contain all the
material<00:01:46.789> after<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.880> mirrors

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780 

but<00:01:53.440> on<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> other<00:01:53.830> hand<00:01:54.070> if<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.310> want<00:01:54.520> a

a<00:02:27.640> new<00:02:27.820> part<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.680> you'll<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.220> mirrored

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
a new part and you'll have the mirrored

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:41.970 
a new part and you'll have the mirrored
version<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.690> can<00:02:37.840> also<00:02:38.050> use<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.500> insert

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
version you can also use the insert

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.170 
version you can also use the insert
mared<00:02:42.670> part

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180

to<00:03:08.510> break<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.959> link<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.500> part<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.000> right<00:03:11.180> now

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
to break a link to the part so right now

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.390 
to break a link to the part so right now
you<00:03:11.450> see<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:12.140> context<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:12.950> if<00:03:13.129> I<00:03:13.220> update

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
you see this in context and if I update

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.789 
you see this in context and if I update
the<00:03:13.879> other<00:03:14.120> body<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:15.079> will<00:03:15.260> update<00:03:15.409> as<00:03:15.650> well

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
the other body this will update as well

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.970 
the other body this will update as well
and<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:17.480> course<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.870> can<00:03:17.989> come<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.590> break

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
and of course I can come in and break

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.650 
and of course I can come in and break
this<00:03:19.610> reference<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.329> want

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.090 

both<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.810> those<00:03:27.900> options<00:03:28.140> are<00:03:28.410> fine<00:03:28.680> if<00:03:28.980> you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
both of those options are fine if you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.090 
both of those options are fine if you
just<00:03:29.280> want<00:03:29.490> an<00:03:29.610> identical<00:03:30.240> copy<00:03:30.710> but<00:03:31.710> what<00:03:31.980> if

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
just want an identical copy but what if

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000 
just want an identical copy but what if
you<00:03:32.310> want<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.940> make<00:03:33.510> changes<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.650> mirrored

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
you want to make changes to the mirrored

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.700 
you want to make changes to the mirrored
side<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.490> part<00:03:36.350> what<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.440> those<00:03:37.590> are

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
side of that part what if those are

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.890 
side of that part what if those are
going<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.860> be<00:03:37.950> slightly<00:03:38.160> different<00:03:38.840> now<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
going to be slightly different now the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.360 
going to be slightly different now the
options<00:03:40.380> aren't<00:03:40.650> quite<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:41.070> straightforward

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
options aren't quite as straightforward

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.559 
options aren't quite as straightforward
once<00:03:44.370> again<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.910> married<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> body<00:03:45.750> over

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.349 

and<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.950> wanted<00:03:54.189> to<00:03:54.249> use<00:03:54.459> sheet<00:03:54.730> metal<00:03:54.999> features

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
and I wanted to use sheet metal features

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:03.599 
and I wanted to use sheet metal features
on<00:03:56.189> the<00:03:57.189> new<00:03:57.340> side<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.790> body<00:04:02.219> this<00:04:03.219> is<00:04:03.280> just

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
on the new side of the body this is just

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.890 
on the new side of the body this is just
a<00:04:03.700> dumb<00:04:03.879> solid<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:07.209> can<00:04:07.389> also<00:04:07.510> see<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
a dumb solid and I can also see that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.119 
a dumb solid and I can also see that
insert<00:04:08.319> bends<00:04:08.769> is<00:04:09.010> grayed<00:04:09.730> out<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.829> if<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:11.920> use

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
insert bends is grayed out and if I use

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:20.810 
insert bends is grayed out and if I use
convert<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.609> sheet<00:04:12.819> metal

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.570 

this<00:04:21.820> feature<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.240> going<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.450> fail<00:04:22.660> as<00:04:23.580> it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
this feature is going to fail as it

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.530 
this feature is going to fail as it
doesn't<00:04:24.790> like<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.450> way<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:25.990> created<00:04:27.540> so

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
doesn't like the way this was created so

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.020 
doesn't like the way this was created so
there's<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:28.900> quick<00:04:29.200> workaround<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.830> this

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.600 

and<00:04:34.030> it's<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.990> use<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.410> move<00:04:35.740> copy<00:04:36.130> bodies

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
and it's to use the move copy bodies

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.020 
and it's to use the move copy bodies
option<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.940> can<00:04:40.030> also<00:04:40.210> find<00:04:40.540> this<00:04:40.720> in<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
option you can also find this in the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.810 
option you can also find this in the
features<00:04:43.030> pulldown<00:04:43.450> in<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.260> insert<00:04:44.590> menu<00:04:49.139> and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
features pulldown in the insert menu and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.969 
features pulldown in the insert menu and
so<00:04:51.820> I'm<00:04:51.940> just<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.210> create<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.660> copy<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.260> top<00:04:53.830> of

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
so I'm just to create a copy on top of

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.000 
so I'm just to create a copy on top of
itself<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.600> now<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.780> have<00:04:59.050> two<00:04:59.320> bodies<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.889> the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
itself so now I have two bodies in the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.820 
itself so now I have two bodies in the
same<00:05:00.220> place<00:05:00.780> I'll<00:05:01.780> go<00:05:02.080> ahead<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.470> hide<00:05:02.650> out

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
same place I'll go ahead and hide out

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.250 
same place I'll go ahead and hide out
that<00:05:03.010> edge<00:05:03.160> flange<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:06.479> now<00:05:07.479> not<00:05:07.780> only<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
that edge flange and now not only can I

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.990 
that edge flange and now not only can I
mirror<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:10.950> but<00:05:11.950> I'm<00:05:12.040> no<00:05:12.190> longer<00:05:12.370> limited<00:05:12.940> by

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
mirror this but I'm no longer limited by

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.940 
mirror this but I'm no longer limited by
using<00:05:16.000> one<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.479> faces<00:05:16.840> on<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.080> side<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.620> my

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
using one of the faces on the side of my

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:27.650 
using one of the faces on the side of my
sheet<00:05:18.160> metal<00:05:18.430> body

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.860 

and<00:05:28.760> now<00:05:29.760> I'm<00:05:29.850> going<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.030> go<00:05:30.150> ahead<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:30.630> delete

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
and now I'm going to go ahead and delete

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.100 
and now I'm going to go ahead and delete
out<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:33.510> body<00:05:33.810> move<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:35.750> show<00:05:36.750> that<00:05:36.930> edge

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
out the body move and show that edge

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.880 
out the body move and show that edge
flange<00:05:37.440> again<00:05:39.380> now<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.470> can<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:40.740> without

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
flange again now you can see without

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.160 
flange again now you can see without
that<00:05:41.160> body<00:05:41.430> present<00:05:41.970> that<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.510> insert<00:05:42.900> bends

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
that body present that this insert bends

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.090 
that body present that this insert bends
option<00:05:43.620> goes<00:05:43.800> away<00:05:45.620> but<00:05:46.620> with<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:46.980> there<00:05:47.250> I

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
option goes away but with it there I

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.270 
option goes away but with it there I
should<00:05:50.100> be<00:05:50.250> able<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.460> select<00:05:50.640> this<00:05:51.180> body<00:05:53.180> and

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
should be able to select this body and

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
should be able to select this body and
create<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.490> flat<00:05:56.910> pattern<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:59.780> then<00:06:00.780> I<00:06:02.300> can

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
create a flat pattern and then I can

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.300 
create a flat pattern and then I can
delete<00:06:03.510> out<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.660> body<00:06:04.020> after<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:07.320> now<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:08.010> have

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
delete out the body after and now I have

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.050 
delete out the body after and now I have
to<00:06:08.790> sheet<00:06:09.210> metal<00:06:09.240> bodies<00:06:10.610> both<00:06:11.610> of<00:06:11.790> which<00:06:11.910> I

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
to sheet metal bodies both of which I

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:21.770 
to sheet metal bodies both of which I
could<00:06:12.120> flatten<00:06:16.550> so<00:06:17.550> for<00:06:17.820> example<00:06:18.270> if<00:06:18.570> I<00:06:20.780> want

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
could flatten so for example if I want

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.630 
could flatten so for example if I want
to<00:06:21.840> make<00:06:21.960> changes<00:06:21.990> to<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:23.010> side<00:06:23.220> of<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.400> part

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
to make changes to the side of the part

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.600 
to make changes to the side of the part
now

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.679 

I<00:06:29.699> can<00:06:30.330> update<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.780> merit<00:06:31.650> image<00:06:31.889> of<00:06:32.069> the<00:06:32.159> part

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
I can update the merit image of the part

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.809 
I can update the merit image of the part
without<00:06:33.689> having<00:06:34.169> to<00:06:34.229> go<00:06:34.349> back<00:06:34.379> in<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.009> change

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
without having to go back in and change

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.980 
without having to go back in and change
this<00:06:36.030> part<00:06:38.180> so<00:06:39.180> this<00:06:39.330> allows<00:06:39.599> me<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.780> quickly

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
this part so this allows me to quickly

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.399 
this part so this allows me to quickly
transition<00:06:40.680> over<00:06:40.889> all<00:06:41.069> that<00:06:41.219> geometry

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
transition over all that geometry

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.830 
transition over all that geometry
without<00:06:43.409> having<00:06:43.860> to<00:06:43.949> recreate<00:06:44.340> it<00:06:44.580> or<00:06:44.939> without

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
without having to recreate it or without

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.659 
without having to recreate it or without
having<00:06:46.050> to<00:06:46.319> work<00:06:46.530> on<00:06:46.740> the<00:06:47.009> opposite<00:06:47.430> side<00:06:47.639> of

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
having to work on the opposite side of

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.689 
having to work on the opposite side of
the<00:06:47.819> part<00:06:48.800> so<00:06:49.800> if<00:06:49.919> you've<00:06:50.069> ever<00:06:50.250> needed<00:06:50.460> to

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
the part so if you've ever needed to

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.360 
the part so if you've ever needed to
work<00:06:50.879> on<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.419> mirrored<00:06:51.900> side<00:06:52.379> of<00:06:52.740> a<00:06:53.069> sheet

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
work on the mirrored side of a sheet

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.929 
work on the mirrored side of a sheet
metal<00:06:53.580> body<00:06:55.009> that's<00:06:56.009> the<00:06:56.310> process<00:06:56.550> you<00:06:56.879> would

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
metal body that's the process you would

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:00.950 
metal body that's the process you would
take<00:06:57.180> to<00:06:57.599> set<00:06:58.020> up<00:06:58.620> that<00:06:58.830> workaround<00:06:59.960> to

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
take to set up that workaround to

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.419 
take to set up that workaround to
convert<00:07:01.319> this<00:07:01.469> over<00:07:01.680> to<00:07:02.129> a<00:07:02.460> sheet<00:07:02.909> metal<00:07:03.090> body
