you're going to start out by getting
like<00:04:23.370> like<00:04:23.940> pretty<00:04:24.390> much<00:04:24.570> just<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:25.010> 56<00:04:26.010> by<00:04:26.250> one

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
like like pretty much just get 56 by one

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.730 
like like pretty much just get 56 by one
red<00:04:27.300> bricks<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.229> stack<00:04:28.380> them<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.560> top<00:04:28.620> of

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
red bricks and just stack them on top of

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.400 
red bricks and just stack them on top of
each<00:04:28.830> other<00:04:29.009> but<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.820> didn't<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.240> those<00:04:30.479> so

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
each other but I didn't have those so

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.370 
each other but I didn't have those so
I'm<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.009> go<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.870> this<00:04:33.870> right

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
I'm just going to go with this right

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.529 
I'm just going to go with this right
there<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.830> like<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:35.940> you're<00:04:36.180> watching

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
there and like that so you're watching

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:37.850 
there and like that so you're watching
this<00:04:36.690> you'll<00:04:36.900> know<00:04:37.050> if<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.530> don't<00:04:37.680> have<00:04:37.770> as

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
this you'll know if you don't have as

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
this you'll know if you don't have as
many<00:04:37.949> pieces<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.330> looks<00:04:39.509> like<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.870> you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
many pieces so if it looks like that you

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.189 
many pieces so if it looks like that you
can<00:04:40.199> see<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.470> creases<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.039> lighting<00:04:41.910> and

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
can see the creases and lighting and

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.700 
can see the creases and lighting and
then<00:04:43.199> just<00:04:43.860> pretty<00:04:44.100> much<00:04:44.220> build<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.789> up<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.419> up

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
then just pretty much build it up and up

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.200 
then just pretty much build it up and up
so<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.100> crossing<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:47.970> looks<00:04:48.120> like

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
so that it's crossing so it looks like

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.270 
so that it's crossing so it looks like
brick<00:04:48.539> wall<00:04:48.810> see<00:04:49.259> all<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.500> lines<00:04:49.740> going<00:04:50.039> like

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
brick wall see all the lines going like

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.360 
brick wall see all the lines going like
that<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.900> then<00:04:51.900> do<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.289> same<00:04:52.560> thing<00:04:52.590> again

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
that and then do that same thing again

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.430 
that and then do that same thing again
and<00:04:54.139> then<00:04:55.139> for<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.380> top<00:04:55.590> one<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> use<00:04:56.160> 2<00:04:56.699> 3<00:04:57.690> by<00:04:57.840> 2

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
and then for the top one I use 2 3 by 2

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.260 
and then for the top one I use 2 3 by 2
3<00:04:59.009> by<00:04:59.130> 1<00:04:59.720> bricks<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:01.849> yeah<00:05:02.849> it's<00:05:03.030> pretty<00:05:03.120> much

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
3 by 1 bricks and yeah it's pretty much

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.659 
3 by 1 bricks and yeah it's pretty much
it<00:05:03.360> looks<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.630> brick<00:05:03.780> wall<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:05.280> basically
