great too so I'm trying to do here is
I'm<00:02:33.720> trying<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.079> use<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.410> space<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:36.329> we

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
I'm trying to use this space so we

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.009 
I'm trying to use this space so we
create<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> cohesive<00:02:37.380> group<00:02:38.690> with<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> mother

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
create a cohesive group with the mother

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.339 
create a cohesive group with the mother
as<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.160> head<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.519> group<00:02:41.760> obviously<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:43.169> we

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
as the head of the group obviously if we

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.159 
as the head of the group obviously if we
can<00:02:43.500> get<00:02:43.650> them<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.389> bond<00:02:45.389> well<00:02:45.660> with<00:02:45.900> her

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
can get them so they bond well with her

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.650 
can get them so they bond well with her
she<00:02:47.099> should<00:02:47.340> be<00:02:47.459> able<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.700> call<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.389> keep

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
she should be able to call them and keep

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.400 
she should be able to call them and keep
them<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:48.930> together

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
them all together

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.940 
them all together
and<00:02:49.560> in<00:02:50.040> fact<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.459> they<00:02:50.760> grow<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.299> as<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.569> group

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
and in fact as they grow up as a group

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.500 
and in fact as they grow up as a group
they<00:02:52.950> should<00:02:53.280> call<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.760> each<00:02:53.849> other<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.269> keep

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
they should call to each other and keep

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.879 
they should call to each other and keep
together<00:02:54.720> I've<00:02:55.019> seen<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.349> before<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.799> the

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
together I've seen this before in the

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.190 
together I've seen this before in the
greenhouse<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.519> do<00:02:56.579> keep<00:02:57.030> together<00:02:57.419> as<00:02:58.139> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
greenhouse they do keep together as a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080 
greenhouse they do keep together as a
group<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.709> that's<00:02:58.799> what<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.099> hoping<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.639> at

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
group so that's what I'm hoping for at

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.610 
group so that's what I'm hoping for at
the<00:03:00.419> moment<00:03:00.480> they're<00:03:00.959> learning<00:03:01.139> her<00:03:01.410> language

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the moment they're learning her language

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.460 
the moment they're learning her language
and<00:03:02.780> they<00:03:03.780> come<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.230> her<00:03:04.319> when<00:03:04.500> she<00:03:04.650> calls<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
and they come to her when she calls and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.720 
and they come to her when she calls and
hopefully<00:03:07.470> this<00:03:07.769> will<00:03:07.799> lead<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.340> being<00:03:08.519> able

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
hopefully this will lead to being able

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.300 
hopefully this will lead to being able
to<00:03:08.940> rearrange<00:03:09.239> them

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.610 

I'm<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.120> gonna<00:03:18.240> put<00:03:18.510> her<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.600> see<00:03:19.440> how<00:03:19.470> she

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I'm just gonna put her in see how she

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.460 
I'm just gonna put her in see how she
goes<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.250> they'll<00:03:20.990> if<00:03:21.990> she<00:03:22.170> starts

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
goes because they'll if she starts

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.350 
goes because they'll if she starts
scratching<00:03:22.830> you've<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:23.370> got<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.580> watch<00:03:23.850> but

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
scratching you've just got to watch but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.610 
scratching you've just got to watch but
they're<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.690> underneath<00:03:24.990> her<00:03:25.290> feet<00:03:25.500> because

from<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.190> compost<00:03:53.520> bin<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:54.090> made<00:03:54.360> a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
from the compost bin and I made a

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.050

playpen<00:03:54.810> within<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.320> play<00:03:55.500> plan<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.610> they<00:03:56.850> can

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
playpen within a play plan so they can

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.530 
playpen within a play plan so they can
start<00:03:57.570> foraging<00:03:57.930> for<00:03:58.410> insect<00:03:59.100> protein<00:03:59.540> which

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
start foraging for insect protein which

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.150 
start foraging for insect protein which
is<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.340> b12<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> good<00:04:04.890> rounded<00:04:05.370> diet<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160

she's<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.340> outside<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.239> she<00:04:09.270> can<00:04:09.630> use<00:04:09.810> her

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840
