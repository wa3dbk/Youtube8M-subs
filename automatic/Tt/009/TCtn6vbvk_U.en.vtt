00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.549
 campaign 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.549
 That's the way I was doing the 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.340
 campaign is usually in the middle of 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.620
 a mission when I decided to play online 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.440
 Such a friend of mine called to play at 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.290

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.590
 restart the game if you have to 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.430
 restart the game sent a fucking 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.500
 moral 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.440

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.810

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.120
 beginning of the mission comes as it is a mission 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.720
 of the solo campaign in the group is the first 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.590
 they saw business as it is now only comes 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.599
 Try to find here if you have the fuck 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.700
 I know I do not have the mission, I do not 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.580
 to get at her you can not 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 meet 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.120
 nowhere in the map is ok you can not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 you get at her for nothing because you do not have 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
 disappeared from the map 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.310

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.710

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.340
 In order to speed up with that shit flame 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.680
 there you can not redo 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.770
 You can not do anything about the last mission. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.740

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.110
 She's not going to the next or not. 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.810

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.110

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.820
 comments, I'm asking if you can 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.260
 that has not got nothing here the bank of 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.900
 data does not have much to do with history 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.650
 has nothing to my brotherhood that was the 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.920
 from the online game does not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.280
 I can not play anything from here. 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.170
 you see that in the options 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.870
 interface game controls credits 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.430
 restore patterns can not do anything 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.590
 The type is that this is going to come back my 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.140
 character nothing more 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.230
 It's amazing, man can not go back 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.140
 I do not know what I'm going to do for the mission. 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.360
 so I would like to share these 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610
 the frustration here with you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.739
 I've already tried another mission to 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.350
 see if after it's over that it's already going 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.770
 straight to the mission that I quit but 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.290
 Unfortunately, apparently, I can not 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.560
 to test here is nothing ta club 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.910
 not renewed and social good right's it going 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.480
 getting by team 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.380
 Notice that you can not face it. 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.930
 There is nothing here on the map though it does not 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.670
 It's nothing, beauty, that's it. Stay there. 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.580
 My tip for you not to do this. 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.770
 shit getting because I already tried to start 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.600
 game I left already I closed the application already 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.480
 hung up on nothing 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.610
 Unfortunately, I do not know. So, that's it. 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.090
 Many thanks to all, thanks again. 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.090
