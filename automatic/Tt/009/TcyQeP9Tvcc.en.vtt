 There is also a place 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.720
 Word Powerpoint Excel 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.720

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.340

 I recovered the other day 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.340
 macbook pro 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.950
 I have been using it for about 3 years since before 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.890
 macbook air 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.680
 It is this calculation 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.010
 Is not it just right 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.010
 Ne 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:42.030
 It is not at all went so Toka make graph elaborate in so much I own the Excel in Well 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.490
 Is a variety with it the but just table 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.150
 If there fairly be said that we are implanted 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.760
 Even a little bit mac 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.349
 It of course is there 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.349
 google documents 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.239
 What 's the rest 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.239
 There are office compatible software 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 I thought so 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:13.140
 Already directly 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:18.450
 and I thought that one is better able to edit office documents 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.970
 I also wanted to try to see how much use it was. 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.220
 As soon as I bought it 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.740
 That's especially because I don't have to raise videos for installation work. 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.290
 I do not mean to raise 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:36.849
 This time I the time being Oh 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.890
 microsoft office mac 2011 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.450
 It was moving to say that it has purchased a plump degree Student's 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.530
 A little bit 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.500
 I will use it 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.590
 I feel comfortable at home again 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.580
 I think that I should be informed 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:03.010
 So this time 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:09.180
 I did not say that there was an open video, but I say the purchase report video very much 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.180
 Thank you very much for viewing here I 'm sorry
