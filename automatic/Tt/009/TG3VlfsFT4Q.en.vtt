00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
they own you know and it's taught me a

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.020 
they own you know and it's taught me a
lot<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.100> about<00:03:23.430> Jimi<00:03:24.239> Hendrix<00:03:24.720> Janis<00:03:25.290> Joplin's

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
lot of about Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.270 
lot of about Jimi Hendrix Janis Joplin's
Stephen<00:03:28.030> Nexo<00:03:28.540> people<00:03:28.840> who<00:03:28.960> I<00:03:28.990> I<00:03:29.470> really

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
Stephen Nexo people who I I really

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.600 
Stephen Nexo people who I I really
didn't<00:03:31.210> know<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.330> lot<00:03:31.690> about<00:03:31.720> now<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> think<00:03:34.020> and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
didn't know a lot about now I think and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.290 
didn't know a lot about now I think and
so<00:03:36.610> music<00:03:36.880> really<00:03:37.330> comes<00:03:37.570> from<00:03:37.720> inside<00:03:38.260> and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
so music really comes from inside and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.390 
so music really comes from inside and
you<00:03:40.300> could<00:03:40.450> be<00:03:40.600> an<00:03:40.750> accomplished<00:03:41.230> musician

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
you could be an accomplished musician

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560 
you could be an accomplished musician
but<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.490> could<00:03:42.640> also<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> person<00:03:43.480> playing

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
but you could also be the person playing

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.210 
but you could also be the person playing
on<00:03:43.810> Venice<00:03:44.110> Beach<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.710> that's<00:03:44.770> what<00:03:45.040> makes

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
on Venice Beach and that's what makes

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.950 
on Venice Beach and that's what makes
them<00:03:45.400> different<00:03:45.610> too<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:46.780> know<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
them different too is that you know a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
sends a message humanly politically

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.570 
sends a message humanly politically
musically<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.300> many<00:04:10.480> things<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.650> quite<00:04:12.370> two

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
musically so many things so quite two

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.560 
musically so many things so quite two
different<00:04:13.000> things

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
different things

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.320 
different things
it's<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:14.440> completely<00:04:14.860> different<00:04:15.070> ballgame<00:04:15.400> so

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
it's a completely different ballgame so

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.440 
it's a completely different ballgame so
I<00:04:16.690> mean<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.709> used<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.760> think<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.120> there

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
I mean I used to think that there

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.670 
I mean I used to think that there
weren't<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.720> whole<00:04:19.750> lot<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.049> crossovers

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
weren't a whole lot of crossovers

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.070 
weren't a whole lot of crossovers
between<00:04:21.030> television<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.390> musicians<00:04:22.900> for

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
between television and musicians for

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.450 
between television and musicians for
example<00:04:23.500> when<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.710> started<00:04:24.070> maybe<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.370> was

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
example when that started maybe it was

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.880 
example when that started maybe it was
Jennifer<00:04:24.850> Lopez<00:04:25.450> or<00:04:25.720> like<00:04:25.900> an<00:04:26.380> iced<00:04:26.560> tea<00:04:26.590> you

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
Jennifer Lopez or like an iced tea you

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.670 
Jennifer Lopez or like an iced tea you
know<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.190> wasn't<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:28.060> wasn't<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:29.470> wasn't

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
know it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.520 
know it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't
normal<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:30.640> somebody<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.750> cross<00:04:31.960> over<00:04:32.169> and<00:04:32.320> be

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
normal for somebody to cross over and be

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.480 
normal for somebody to cross over and be
successful<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:33.730> good<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.960> know

it's like the Bono's I mean it's just

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.400 
it's like the Bono's I mean it's just
what<00:04:38.740> wouldn't<00:04:39.250> happen<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.820> now<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.900> start
