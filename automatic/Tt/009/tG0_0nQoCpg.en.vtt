00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
but the reason why I haven't really

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 
but the reason why I haven't really
gotten<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.790> hands<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.540> until<00:00:33.809> recently<00:00:34.440> is

gotten my hands on it until recently is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
gotten my hands on it until recently is
because<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.180> fact<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> try<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> dream

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because of the fact that I try the dream

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
because of the fact that I try the dream
matte<00:00:37.829> mousse<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.340> first<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.809> matte

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
matte mousse at first I like that matte

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.160 
matte mousse at first I like that matte
finish<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> did<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.989> one

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
finish and really I did like this one

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
finish and really I did like this one
but<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> find<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> better<00:00:44.550> for

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
but I do find that this is better for

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.790 
but I do find that this is better for
those<00:00:44.820> who<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.090> oily<00:00:45.539> skin<00:00:45.570> now<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
those who have oily skin now with that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bit about my preference on foundation as

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
bit about my preference on foundation as
well<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.719> skin<00:00:51.989> type<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
well of my skin type just so you have a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.990 
well of my skin type just so you have a
background<00:00:53.760> idea<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.320> skin<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.039> more<00:00:56.670> only

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
find that a lot of times foundation will

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
find that a lot of times foundation will
settle<00:01:02.370> into<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.879> left<00:01:03.180> parenthesis<00:01:03.989> lines

want<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> cover<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:45.000> actually<00:01:45.360> blend<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
want to cover or actually blend them a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.300 
want to cover or actually blend them a
little<00:01:46.140> bit<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> five

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
little bit is because I have like five

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.240 
little bit is because I have like five
on<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.329> side<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.930> 25<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on this side and this side I have 25 so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
on this side and this side I have 25 so
just<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> balance<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just to balance it out a little bit I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
just to balance it out a little bit I
find<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> applying<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.549> foundation<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.090> me

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
find that applying a foundation with me

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
find that applying a foundation with me
medium<00:01:54.750> coverage<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.470> perfect<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.159> with

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
medium coverage is just perfect so with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.200 
medium coverage is just perfect so with
that<00:01:56.850> said<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.509> skin<00:01:58.040> type<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.340> more<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that said my skin type is more on the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.080 
that said my skin type is more on the
normal<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.530> combination<00:02:01.920> t-zone<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.969> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
normal with a combination t-zone I do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.899 
normal with a combination t-zone I do
have<00:02:03.630> drier<00:02:03.990> skin<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.250> find<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> my

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
have drier skin but I do find that my

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.290 
have drier skin but I do find that my
skin<00:02:06.180> isn't<00:02:06.360> dry<00:02:06.719> enough<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.049> say<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.500> am<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
skin isn't dry enough to say that I am a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600 
skin isn't dry enough to say that I am a
dry<00:02:09.300> skin<00:02:09.690> type<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.860> comes<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.280> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
dry skin type it comes in this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.700 
dry skin type it comes in this
being<00:02:11.880> int<00:02:12.090> type<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.600> bottle<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.320> glass

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
being int type of bottle that is glass

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.880 
being int type of bottle that is glass
and<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.970> comes<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.590> pump

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and it comes out of this little pump

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.100 
and it comes out of this little pump
right<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.970> when<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.360> pump<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.870> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
right here so when you pump it out as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.740 
right here so when you pump it out as
you<00:02:19.260> can<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.220> really<00:02:20.640> luxurious<00:02:20.880> rich

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you can see it's a really luxurious rich

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.990 
you can see it's a really luxurious rich
type<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.410> liquid<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:23.070> apply<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.970> over

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
type of liquid you apply it all over

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.850 
type of liquid you apply it all over
your<00:02:24.240> face<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.570> then<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.140> becomes<00:02:25.470> kind<00:02:25.740> of

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
your face and then it becomes kind of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.430 
your face and then it becomes kind of
like<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.220> mousse<00:02:26.610> consistency<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:28.080> gives<00:02:28.320> it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
like a mousse consistency that gives it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.290 
like a mousse consistency that gives it
a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.770> more<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> powdery<00:02:29.580> touch<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
a little bit more of a powdery touch to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
a little bit more of a powdery touch to
it<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.870> setting<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.770> with<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> powder<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.400> not

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it so setting it with a powder is not

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.700 
it so setting it with a powder is not
necessary<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.270> my<00:02:33.390> opinion<00:02:33.840> only<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.590> my

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
necessary in my opinion only in my

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.250 
necessary in my opinion only in my
t-zone<00:02:34.950> area<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.610> set<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> light<00:02:36.300> amount<00:02:37.050> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
t-zone area I do set a light amount of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.650 
t-zone area I do set a light amount of
powder<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.820> prevent<00:02:39.390> any

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
powder just to really prevent any

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.960 
powder just to really prevent any
creasing<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.350> well<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.710> prevent<00:02:41.100> any<00:02:41.340> oil

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
creasing as well as prevent any oil

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.000 
creasing as well as prevent any oil
secretion<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.990> find<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.590> finish<00:02:43.980> is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
secretion but I find that this finish is

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
secretion but I find that this finish is
just<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.850> gorgeous<00:02:45.210> my<00:02:46.140> favorite

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just really really gorgeous my favorite

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.290 
just really really gorgeous my favorite
way<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.710> apply<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.160> foundation<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.090> use

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
way to apply this foundation is to use

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.750 
way to apply this foundation is to use
it<00:02:48.450> with<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:48.660> fingers<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.410> apply<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> pump<00:02:50.280> into

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it with my fingers I apply a pump into

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.790 
it with my fingers I apply a pump into
my<00:02:50.880> hand<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.330> rub<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.810> around<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> little<00:02:52.350> bit<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
my hand I rub it around a little bit and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.580 
my hand I rub it around a little bit and
then<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.730> my<00:02:53.880> face<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.840> super<00:02:55.260> easy<00:02:55.410> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
then all over my face it's super easy to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.470 
then all over my face it's super easy to
use<00:02:55.709> there's<00:02:56.130> no<00:02:56.370> streaks<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.030> don't<00:02:57.300> need<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
use there's no streaks you don't need to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.290 
use there's no streaks you don't need to
have<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.870> bust<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.740> brush<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.550> apply<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
have to bust out a brush to apply it and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.270 
have to bust out a brush to apply it and
I<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.959> find<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> really<00:03:01.560> makes<00:03:02.040> my<00:03:02.220> skin

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
I just find that it really makes my skin

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.750 
I just find that it really makes my skin
look<00:03:03.240> good<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.680> skin<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.370> bottle

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
look good it's like a skin in a bottle

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
look good it's like a skin in a bottle
so<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.270> like<00:03:06.390> new<00:03:06.870> skin<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.740> just<00:03:07.920> put

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
so it's like new skin that you just put

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.740 
so it's like new skin that you just put
on<00:03:08.190> top<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:08.850> face<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.360> kind<00:03:09.630> of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
on top of your face to kind of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.640 
on top of your face to kind of
camouflage<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:11.070> cover<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.690> own<00:03:12.990> skin<00:03:13.440> if

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
camouflage and cover your own skin if

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.680 
camouflage and cover your own skin if
that<00:03:14.040> makes<00:03:14.280> sense<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.390> see<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that makes sense and as you can see the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
that makes sense and as you can see the
way<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.170> blends<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:16.980> fill-in<00:03:17.519> on

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
way that it just blends and fill-in on

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.759 
way that it just blends and fill-in on
top<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> your<00:03:18.180> skin<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.690> doesn't<00:03:18.930> essentially

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
top of your skin it doesn't essentially

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.310 
top of your skin it doesn't essentially
absolutely<00:03:20.519> any<00:03:20.760> type<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> marks<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.230> I

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
absolutely any type of marks so if I

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.350 
absolutely any type of marks so if I
have<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.769> bump<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.250> some<00:03:24.150> type<00:03:24.330> of

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
have like a bump or some type of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
actually put this all over my face and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.070 
actually put this all over my face and
its<00:03:28.500> spot<00:03:29.100> conceal<00:03:29.550> with<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.870> been<00:03:31.050> a

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
its spot conceal with this I have been a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.009 
its spot conceal with this I have been a
very<00:03:31.590> big<00:03:31.830> fan<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.100> foundation<00:03:33.030> powder<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
very big fan of foundation powder the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.600 
very big fan of foundation powder the
reason<00:03:34.350> being<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.950> easy<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.280> apply

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
reason being is that it's easy to apply

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.660 
reason being is that it's easy to apply
of<00:03:35.880> course<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.390> also<00:03:37.350> um<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:38.070> doesn't<00:03:38.220> call<00:03:38.489> my

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of course and also um it doesn't call my

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.699 
of course and also um it doesn't call my
pores<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.540> overall<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.019> found<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.680> a

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
pores but overall I found that a

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.140 
pores but overall I found that a
foundation<00:03:40.950> powder<00:03:41.400> was<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> little<00:03:41.910> bit<00:03:42.000> too

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
foundation powder was a little bit too

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.050 
foundation powder was a little bit too
drying<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.840> my<00:03:43.110> skin<00:03:43.530> um<00:03:44.310> even<00:03:44.790> though<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> do

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
drying on my skin um even though I do

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.020 
drying on my skin um even though I do
exfoliate<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.320> do<00:03:46.500> find<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.130> sometimes<00:03:47.730> some

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
exfoliate I do find that sometimes some

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.940 
exfoliate I do find that sometimes some
areas<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.630> going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.930> look<00:03:49.110> more<00:03:49.320> drier<00:03:49.650> and

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
areas it's going to look more drier and

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.710 
areas it's going to look more drier and
at<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.190> end<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.489> day<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.120> moisture<00:03:51.450> on<00:03:51.480> my

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
at the end of the day the moisture on my

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.290 
at the end of the day the moisture on my
face<00:03:51.959> isn't<00:03:52.230> there<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.370> use<00:03:53.760> something

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
face isn't there if you use something

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.070 
face isn't there if you use something
that<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.630> too<00:03:54.900> drying<00:03:55.290> your<00:03:55.980> body<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.610> going<00:03:56.790> to

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
that is too drying your body is going to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.259 
that is too drying your body is going to
naturally<00:03:58.080> produce<00:03:58.590> oil<00:03:59.130> because<00:03:59.910> it's

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
naturally produce oil because it's

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.640 
naturally produce oil because it's
sensing<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.380> your<00:04:01.830> skin<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.550> not<00:04:02.940> hydrated

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
sensing that your skin is not hydrated

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.020 
sensing that your skin is not hydrated
enough<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.310> going<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.580> secrete<00:04:05.790> that

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
enough and so it's going to secrete that

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.630 
enough and so it's going to secrete that
oil<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.570> compensate<00:04:07.290> for<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.560> dryness<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:08.280> if

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
oil to compensate for that dryness so if

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.820 
oil to compensate for that dryness so if
you're<00:04:08.790> trying<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.209> use<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.810> really<00:04:10.410> dry

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
were more yellow and warm skin tones

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.980 
were more yellow and warm skin tones
that<00:04:56.130> were<00:04:56.280> great<00:04:56.669> in<00:04:56.850> this<00:04:57.120> line<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:57.870> is

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
that were great in this line but this is

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.830 
that were great in this line but this is
the<00:04:58.110> only<00:04:58.350> color<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.010> luckily<00:04:59.310> it<00:05:00.270> matched<00:05:00.570> me

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
the only color and luckily it matched me

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840 
the only color and luckily it matched me
this<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.260> only<00:05:01.440> color<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.220> more<00:05:02.700> on

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
this is the only color that is more on

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.450 
this is the only color that is more on
the<00:05:02.970> yellow<00:05:03.150> base<00:05:03.780> side<00:05:04.139> but<00:05:04.710> overall<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.160> do

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
the yellow base side but overall I do

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.550 
the yellow base side but overall I do
find<00:05:05.669> that<00:05:05.700> there<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.030> very<00:05:06.510> large<00:05:06.990> range<00:05:07.380> of

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
find that there is a very large range of

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980 
find that there is a very large range of
colors<00:05:07.979> just<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.970> fact<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.270> if<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.570> do<00:05:09.750> have
