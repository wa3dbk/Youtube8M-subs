it<00:02:01.510> so<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.870> people<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.260> manipulate<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.920> or

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
it so that people can manipulate it or

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.490 
it so that people can manipulate it or
we<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.430> change<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.910> why<00:02:04.900> don't<00:02:05.050> we<00:02:05.110> bring<00:02:05.290> back

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
we can change it why don't we bring back

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.260 
we can change it why don't we bring back
Blood<00:02:06.010> Gulch<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.430> carve<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.820> all<00:02:06.940> up<00:02:07.090> into

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.960 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into
pieces<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:07.990> people<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:08.980> and<00:02:09.760> start

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
pieces so that people can and start

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.060 
pieces so that people can and start
manipulating<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.110> interesting<00:02:11.620> ways<00:02:11.770> and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
manipulating it and interesting ways and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.360 
manipulating it and interesting ways and
then<00:02:12.850> sanctuary<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> other<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
then sanctuary was the other one the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.860 
then sanctuary was the other one the
cage<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.740> Paradiso<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.270> Chad<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.810> I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
cage and Paradiso that's just Chad and I

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.870 
cage and Paradiso that's just Chad and I
playing<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.620> map<00:02:20.860> editor<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.490> actually

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
playing with a map editor and actually

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.810 
playing with a map editor and actually
building<00:02:22.300> cool<00:02:23.020> maps<00:02:23.380> within<00:02:24.040> forge<00:02:24.340> world<00:02:24.550> I

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
building cool maps within forge world I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.790 
building cool maps within forge world I
mean<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.150> were<00:02:25.180> doing<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.570> exactly<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
mean we were doing that exactly how the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.390 
mean we were doing that exactly how the
fans<00:02:27.010> would<00:02:27.160> do<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.830> definitely<00:02:29.980> looked<00:02:30.280> at

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
fans would do it we definitely looked at

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.340 
fans would do it we definitely looked at
what<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:30.640> did<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:30.850> Halo<00:02:31.030> 3<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.570> said<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.320> can

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.260 
what we did in Halo 3 and said what can
we<00:02:32.500> learn<00:02:32.620> from<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.030> thing<00:02:34.210> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
we learn from this it's one thing to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.570 
we learn from this it's one thing to
build<00:02:34.540> just<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.230> stunning<00:02:36.010> amount<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.430> Matt

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
build just a stunning amount of Matt

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.420 
build just a stunning amount of Matt
variants<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:38.020> nobody<00:02:38.620> was<00:02:38.920> expecting

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
variants but like nobody was expecting

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.040 
variants but like nobody was expecting
for<00:02:39.670> George<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.330> like<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.870> was<00:02:41.020> just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
for George I don't think like I was just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.970 
for George I don't think like I was just
a<00:02:41.320> completely<00:02:41.680> whoa<00:02:42.390> what<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.740> Rube<00:02:44.740> Goldberg

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
a completely whoa what the Rube Goldberg

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.310 
a completely whoa what the Rube Goldberg
machines<00:02:45.580> yeah<00:02:45.850> those<00:02:46.120> are<00:02:46.300> everywhere<00:02:46.750> in

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.900 

Halo<00:02:50.320> 3<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.770> was<00:02:50.920> cool<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.730> move

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
Halo 3 it was cool that you can move

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.340 
Halo 3 it was cool that you can move
things<00:02:52.090> around<00:02:52.300> but<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.840> still<00:02:53.050> kind<00:02:53.320> of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
things around but it was still kind of

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.790 
things around but it was still kind of
clunky<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.300> we're<00:02:55.300> like<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.650> make

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
clunky and we're like we have to make

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.980 
clunky and we're like we have to make
this<00:02:56.980> better<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:58.450> are<00:02:58.570> some<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.780> tricks

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
this better what are some of the tricks

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.800 
this better what are some of the tricks
at<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.290> communities<00:02:59.710> using<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.220> how<00:03:01.210> can<00:03:01.630> we

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
at the communities using and how can we

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.510 
at the communities using and how can we
make<00:03:02.020> those<00:03:02.230> not<00:03:02.470> be<00:03:02.620> tricks<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.370> make

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
make those not be tricks and just make

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.170 
make those not be tricks and just make
those<00:03:03.670> be<00:03:03.820> tools<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:05.920> took<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.459> stuff<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
those be tools we we took that stuff and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.449 
those be tools we we took that stuff and
made<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> real<00:03:08.680> feature<00:03:08.950> there's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
made it like a real feature there's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.060 
made it like a real feature there's
normal<00:03:09.880> phased<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.660> fixed<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.560> normal<00:03:11.920> is

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
normal phased and fixed so normal is

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.920 
normal phased and fixed so normal is
like<00:03:12.430> halo<00:03:12.640> 3<00:03:12.880> style<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.420> know<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.600> bumps<00:03:13.870> into

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
like halo 3 style you know it bumps into

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.630 
like halo 3 style you know it bumps into
stuff<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.500> let<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.739> go<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:15.130> falls<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.550> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
stuff and you let it go it falls on the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.030 
stuff and you let it go it falls on the
ground<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:16.180> moves<00:03:16.510> around<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.900> stuff<00:03:17.040> fixed

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
ground and moves around and stuff fixed

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520 
ground and moves around and stuff fixed
is<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:19.090> same<00:03:19.300> thing<00:03:19.540> except<00:03:20.050> when<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.290> let<00:03:20.440> it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
is the same thing except when you let it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.410 
is the same thing except when you let it
go<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.920> stays<00:03:21.190> exactly<00:03:21.430> where<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.970> was<00:03:22.090> and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
go it stays exactly where it was and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.130 
go it stays exactly where it was and
then<00:03:23.260> phase<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.430> coolest<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:25.750> it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
then phase is the coolest because it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.360 
then phase is the coolest because it
means<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:26.590> while<00:03:26.920> you're<00:03:27.070> editing<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
means that while you're editing the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.770 
means that while you're editing the
object<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.880> not<00:03:28.090> actually<00:03:28.510> interacting

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
object it's not actually interacting

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.540 
object it's not actually interacting
with<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.930> environment<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.190> put<00:03:30.459> it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
with the environment you can put it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.910 
with the environment you can put it
through<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> wall<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.660> can<00:03:31.810> put<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.800> know

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
through a wall you can put it you know

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.670 
through a wall you can put it you know
through<00:03:33.160> other<00:03:33.340> objects<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:34.870> changed

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
through other objects which changed

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.620 
through other objects which changed
everything<00:03:36.190> for<00:03:36.220> forge<00:03:36.700> like<00:03:37.030> immediately

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
everything for forge like immediately

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.470 
everything for forge like immediately
it's<00:03:38.500> much<00:03:38.800> easier<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.430> build<00:03:39.880> afford<00:03:40.239> space

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it's much easier to build afford space

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.530 
it's much easier to build afford space
there's<00:03:41.110> snaps<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.040> rotates<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.790> degrees

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
there's snaps and rotates and degrees

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.660 
there's snaps and rotates and degrees
and<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.080> units<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.130> can<00:03:45.310> move<00:03:45.430> things

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
and and units that you can move things

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.800 
and and units that you can move things
you<00:03:45.850> can<00:03:45.970> be<00:03:46.060> very<00:03:46.270> precise

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
you can be very precise

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.660 
you can be very precise
the<00:03:48.810> camera<00:03:49.050> controls<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:50.190> actually<00:03:50.550> really

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
the camera controls it's actually really

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.309 
the camera controls it's actually really
good<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.090> object<00:03:51.480> placement<00:03:51.660> because<00:03:51.959> like

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
good for object placement because like

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.930
