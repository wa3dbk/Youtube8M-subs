devices<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.640> those<00:04:42.790> should<00:04:43.060> we<00:04:43.210> wish<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
devices to those should we wish to

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.020 
devices to those should we wish to
hardwire<00:04:44.050> something<00:04:44.500> into<00:04:44.740> our<00:04:44.860> network<00:04:45.040> what

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
hardwire something into our network what

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.210 
hardwire something into our network what
this<00:04:46.210> actually<00:04:46.390> does<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:47.410> not<00:04:47.650> only<00:04:47.770> provide

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
this actually does is not only provide

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.270 
this actually does is not only provide
wired<00:04:49.030> connections<00:04:49.690> but<00:04:50.230> also<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.680> 802<00:04:51.070> 11

as<00:04:58.480> well<00:04:58.680> now<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.740> can<00:04:59.830> also<00:05:00.190> get<00:05:00.490> an<00:05:00.640> airport

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
as well now you can also get an airport

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.200 
as well now you can also get an airport
express<00:05:02.200> base<00:05:02.830> station<00:05:03.370> which<00:05:03.520> i<00:05:03.700> unboxed<00:05:04.120> on

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
the channel a little while back the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.800 
the channel a little while back the
difference<00:05:06.580> between<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:07.210> airport<00:05:07.720> express

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
use that to store back up so you can

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.330 
use that to store back up so you can
have<00:05:17.200> perhaps<00:05:17.380> your<00:05:17.680> macbook<00:05:18.160> air

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
like this is a really old one actually

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.040 
like this is a really old one actually
this<00:05:38.530> is<00:05:38.680> one<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.920> original<00:05:39.780> airport<00:05:40.780> time

I<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:50.860> turn<00:05:51.070> this<00:05:51.280> round<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.990> can<00:05:53.020> see<00:05:53.380> all

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
I just turn this round you can see all

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.710 
I just turn this round you can see all
of<00:05:53.710> the<00:05:53.800> connections<00:05:54.390> compared<00:05:55.390> to<00:05:55.510> this<00:05:55.660> one

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
of the connections compared to this one

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.440 
of the connections compared to this one
remain<00:05:56.620> pretty<00:05:57.010> much<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.430> same<00:05:57.640> we've<00:05:58.150> still

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
remain pretty much the same we've still

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.020 
remain pretty much the same we've still
got<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.980> input<00:05:59.980> for<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.250> power<00:06:00.430> supply<00:06:00.820> with

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
got the input for the power supply with

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.120 
got the input for the power supply with
store<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.360> USB<00:06:01.840> connection<00:06:02.020> we've<00:06:02.860> got<00:06:02.980> that

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
store a USB connection we've got that

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.100 
store a USB connection we've got that
one<00:06:03.340> socket<00:06:03.670> and<00:06:03.910> three<00:06:04.330> Ethernet<00:06:04.690> sockets

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
one socket and three Ethernet sockets

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.500 
one socket and three Ethernet sockets
but<00:06:05.770> we'll<00:06:05.860> see<00:06:05.980> what<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.220> reset<00:06:06.670> switch<00:06:06.970> the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
but we'll see what the reset switch the

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.670 
but we'll see what the reset switch the
only<00:06:07.660> thing<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:07.930> this<00:06:08.020> one's<00:06:08.260> got<00:06:08.440> that's

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
only thing that this one's got that's

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.140 
only thing that this one's got that's
slightly<00:06:08.920> different<00:06:09.400> this<00:06:09.820> did<00:06:10.000> have<00:06:10.120> a

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
slightly different this did have a

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.940 
slightly different this did have a
Kensington<00:06:10.780> lock<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:11.200> tether<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.620> down<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.920> a

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
Kensington lock to tether it down to a

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.850 
Kensington lock to tether it down to a
desk<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.850> the<00:06:12.970> new<00:06:13.150> 2013<00:06:13.600> model<00:06:14.230> doesn't<00:06:14.590> have

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
desk and the new 2013 model doesn't have

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.820 
desk and the new 2013 model doesn't have
that<00:06:15.450> so<00:06:16.450> that's<00:06:16.630> it<00:06:16.810> for<00:06:17.230> the<00:06:17.410> little

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
that so that's it for the little

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.830 
that so that's it for the little
comparison<00:06:18.160> for<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:18.760> I<00:06:18.970> hope<00:06:19.330> you<00:06:19.480> enjoyed

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
comparison for you I hope you enjoyed

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.510 
comparison for you I hope you enjoyed
that<00:06:19.870> it<00:06:20.410> will<00:06:20.500> look<00:06:20.710> back<00:06:20.950> at<00:06:21.160> one<00:06:21.310> of<00:06:21.430> the

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
that it will look back at one of the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.390 
that it will look back at one of the
original<00:06:22.060> airport<00:06:22.900> time<00:06:23.140> capsules<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:24.310> I'm

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
original airport time capsules so I'm

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.770 
original airport time capsules so I'm
going<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.550> add<00:06:24.700> this<00:06:24.850> into<00:06:25.060> my<00:06:25.210> network<00:06:25.600> I

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
going to add this into my network I

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.320 
going to add this into my network I
absolutely<00:06:26.080> love<00:06:26.470> Apple<00:06:26.980> products<00:06:27.370> and<00:06:27.640> I

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
absolutely love Apple products and I

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.460 
absolutely love Apple products and I
think<00:06:28.510> they've<00:06:28.600> done<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.780> really<00:06:28.870> good<00:06:29.230> job<00:06:29.290> of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
think they've done a really good job of

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.010 
think they've done a really good job of
redesigning<00:06:30.130> this<00:06:30.460> just<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.270> point<00:06:31.420> out<00:06:31.750> that

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
redesigning this just to point out that

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.240 
redesigning this just to point out that
the<00:06:32.170> reason<00:06:32.500> they've<00:06:32.620> done<00:06:32.800> this<00:06:32.980> sort<00:06:33.160> of

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
the reason they've done this sort of

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.820 
the reason they've done this sort of
taller<00:06:33.880> design<00:06:34.390> i've<00:06:34.900> got<00:06:35.080> this<00:06:35.200> asked<00:06:35.560> me

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
taller design i've got this asked me

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.160 
taller design i've got this asked me
about<00:06:36.130> the<00:06:36.370> previous<00:06:37.060> video<00:06:37.300> where<00:06:37.570> i<00:06:37.630> unbox

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
about the previous video where i unbox

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.410 
about the previous video where i unbox
the<00:06:38.470> airport<00:06:39.310> extreme<00:06:39.490> base<00:06:39.880> station

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
the airport extreme base station

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.440 
the airport extreme base station
it's<00:06:41.020> taller<00:06:41.530> with<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.370> smaller<00:06:42.730> footprint<00:06:43.240> but

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
it's taller with a smaller footprint but

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.700 
it's taller with a smaller footprint but
I've<00:06:43.570> done<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.870> because<00:06:44.020> this<00:06:44.410> actually

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
I've done that because this actually

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.800 
I've done that because this actually
houses<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.520> antennas<00:06:46.120> that<00:06:46.150> should<00:06:46.510> give<00:06:46.660> you

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
houses the antennas that should give you

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.080 
houses the antennas that should give you
a<00:06:47.020> much<00:06:47.470> better<00:06:47.770> range<00:06:48.130> with<00:06:48.460> regards<00:06:48.880> your

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
a much better range with regards your

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.290 
a much better range with regards your
wireless<00:06:49.840> connectivity<00:06:50.670> so<00:06:51.670> that<00:06:51.760> fit<00:06:52.000> that's

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
wireless connectivity so that fit that's

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.140 
wireless connectivity so that fit that's
it<00:06:52.480> for<00:06:52.630> this<00:06:52.690> unboxing<00:06:52.900> of<00:06:53.380> the<00:06:54.190> airport<00:06:54.760> time
