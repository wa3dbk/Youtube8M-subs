schedule to spend some time with me do

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.060 
schedule to spend some time with me do
likewise<00:03:31.690> for<00:03:31.870> myself<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.410> have<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.650> sometimes

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
likewise for myself I have to sometimes

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.860 
likewise for myself I have to sometimes
take<00:03:33.400> some<00:03:33.640> time<00:03:33.850> off<00:03:34.000> my<00:03:34.209> schedule<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.660> fly

over there to spend some time with her
so<00:03:37.510> yeah<00:03:37.720> having<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.140> long-distance

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
so yeah having a long-distance

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.410 
so yeah having a long-distance
relationship<00:03:38.830> isn't<00:03:39.459> exactly<00:03:39.970> easy<00:03:40.209> to

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
relationship isn't exactly easy to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.210 
relationship isn't exactly easy to
maintain<00:03:40.690> because<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.590> do<00:03:41.680> not<00:03:41.769> get<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.040> see

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
maintain because we do not get to see

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.710 
maintain because we do not get to see
each<00:03:42.280> other<00:03:42.550> that<00:03:42.760> often<00:03:43.000> because<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.570> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
each other that often because of the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.229 
each other that often because of the
long<00:03:43.959> distance<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.370> do<00:03:45.730> have<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> lot

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
long distance so we do have to a lot

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.729 
long distance so we do have to a lot
have<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> lot<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.810> trust<00:03:47.110> with<00:03:47.320> each<00:03:47.440> other

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
have a lot of trust with each other

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.949 
have a lot of trust with each other
whereby<00:03:48.130> we<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.580> have<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.910> trust<00:03:49.600> each<00:03:49.720> other

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
whereby we just have to trust each other

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.479 
whereby we just have to trust each other
that<00:03:50.170> we<00:03:50.260> do<00:03:50.350> not<00:03:50.440> do<00:03:50.620> anything<00:03:50.860> behind<00:03:51.220> our

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
that we do not do anything behind our

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:51.930 
that we do not do anything behind our
back

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
back

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.970 
back
so<00:03:52.330> yeah<00:03:53.019> that's<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> for<00:03:53.440> my<00:03:53.680> whole<00:03:53.890> entire

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
so yeah that's it for my whole entire

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.949 
so yeah that's it for my whole entire
relationships<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.880> wireman<00:03:55.390> should<00:03:55.660> be<00:03:55.750> not

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
relationships to wireman should be not

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.479 
relationships to wireman should be not
free<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.470> actually<00:03:56.709> clash<00:03:56.950> for<00:03:57.130> these<00:03:57.280> few

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
free to actually clash for these few

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.550 
free to actually clash for these few
days<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:58.420> also<00:03:58.630> not<00:03:58.780> checking<00:03:58.989> on<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.290> walls

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
increasing a little bit more and of

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.640 
increasing a little bit more and of
course<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:13.390> didn't<00:04:13.690> do<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.930> much<00:04:14.110> farming<00:04:14.530> as

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
course I didn't do that much farming as

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.800 
course I didn't do that much farming as
compared<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.100> my<00:04:15.220> previous<00:04:15.370> episode<00:04:16.090> because

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
compared to my previous episode because

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.140 
compared to my previous episode because
as<00:04:16.989> mentioned<00:04:17.410> today<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.680> wasn't<00:04:18.010> free<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.729> go

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
as mentioned today I wasn't free to go

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.500 
as mentioned today I wasn't free to go
ahead

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
ahead

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.500 
ahead
