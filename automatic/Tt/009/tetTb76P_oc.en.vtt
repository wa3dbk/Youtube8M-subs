my<00:01:00.989> fingers<00:01:01.409> um<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.150> not<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
my fingers um so that it's not in that

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.020 
my fingers um so that it's not in that
big<00:01:04.350> tangle<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.549> scissors<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
big tangle and then I use scissors to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.770 
big tangle and then I use scissors to
make<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.690> um<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.890> hold<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.310> down<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.880> then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
make it um like to hold it down and then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.070 
make it um like to hold it down and then
what<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.119> number<00:01:12.479> 4<00:01:12.810> or

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
what you can do is make the number 4 or

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.590 
what you can do is make the number 4 or
backwards<00:01:13.860> 4<00:01:14.220> doesn't<00:01:14.790> really<00:01:15.030> matter

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
backwards 4 doesn't really matter

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
backwards 4 doesn't really matter
and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.439> um<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.329> over

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and then um so you're going to go over

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
and then um so you're going to go over
and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.079> bring<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.859> underneath<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and then bring it up underneath and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.300 
and then bring it up underneath and
you're<00:01:21.180> gonna<00:01:21.329> create<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:21.930> knots<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:22.649> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you're gonna create these knots and it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.099 
you're gonna create these knots and it
doesn't<00:01:23.670> matter<00:01:23.789> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> backwards<00:01:24.780> 4

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
doesn't matter if you do a backwards 4

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.469 
doesn't matter if you do a backwards 4
or<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.710> ways<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.250> um<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.270> sure

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
or right ways for um just make sure

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
or right ways for um just make sure
consistent<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> whole<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:29.009> through<00:01:29.039> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
consistent the whole way through and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.139 
consistent the whole way through and
then<00:01:30.659> um<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.219> this<00:01:32.429> is<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.880> kind

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
then um as you can see this is this kind

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.880 
then um as you can see this is this kind
of<00:01:33.210> made<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> harder<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.740> just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
of made it harder to do so I just

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
of made it harder to do so I just
stopped<00:01:35.670> doing<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.229> but<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.289> thought<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
stopped doing that but I thought you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
stopped doing that but I thought you
know<00:01:38.009> having<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> wait<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.030> keep<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.359> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
know having a wait it would keep it in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
know having a wait it would keep it in
place<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.829> did<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.100> again<00:01:41.429> with<00:01:41.460> my<00:01:41.789> phone

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
place so I did it again with my phone

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
place so I did it again with my phone
and<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> reach<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.280> end

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and as you can see here I reach the end

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
and as you can see here I reach the end
of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.450> headphone<00:01:45.719> thing<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.979> make

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of the one headphone thing so just make

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.010 
of the one headphone thing so just make

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and then I'm cut a piece of thread make

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.679 
and then I'm cut a piece of thread make
it<00:01:51.929> loan<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.469> obviously<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.480 
then um tie it in a bunch of naath I
again<00:01:58.170> did<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.590> three<00:01:58.859> or<00:01:59.009> four<00:01:59.100> knots

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
again did like three or four knots

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
again did like three or four knots
because<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.390> paranoid<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.079> then

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because I'm like so paranoid and then

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.219 
because I'm like so paranoid and then
take<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.490> scissors<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.119> cut<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.990> at

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
take your scissors and cut it right at

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
take your scissors and cut it right at
the<00:02:04.350> edge<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:06.060> makes<00:02:06.210> sure<00:02:06.359> that

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the edge and that just makes sure that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.139 
the edge and that just makes sure that
there's<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:08.310> two<00:02:08.460> loose<00:02:08.640> threads

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.900 
there's no like two loose threads
dangling<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.960> anything<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> want

so the only other thing is um for like

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.399 
so the only other thing is um for like
the<00:02:43.400> long<00:02:43.640> cable<00:02:43.970> part<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.540> use<00:02:44.780> multiple

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
the long cable part I use multiple

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.160 
the long cable part I use multiple
colors<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.040> what<00:02:46.909> you<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.209> do<00:02:47.359> is<00:02:47.629> just<00:02:47.900> take

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
colors so what you can do is just take

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.199 
colors so what you can do is just take
the<00:02:48.409> new<00:02:48.560> color<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.370> want<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:49.790> tie<00:02:50.150> it

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
on and then um leave yourself like an

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660 
on and then um leave yourself like an
end<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.510> then<00:02:53.810> tie<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.769> two<00:02:55.129> ends<00:02:55.489> together

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
end and then tie the two ends together

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.420 
end and then tie the two ends together
so<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.420> new<00:02:56.599> string<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.349> old<00:02:57.530> string<00:02:57.889> tie

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
