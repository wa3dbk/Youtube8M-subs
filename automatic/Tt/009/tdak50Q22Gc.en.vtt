quickly and you can see its angles
really<00:01:39.270> quickly<00:01:39.740> once<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.950> break<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.370> with

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
really quickly once you break it with

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
really quickly once you break it with
your<00:01:41.520> fingers<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.110> rap<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:44.640> rap<00:01:44.670> it

like right before I cutters

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.490 
like right before I cutters
camera<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.990> mess

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
camera and it is a mess

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160 
camera and it is a mess
it's<00:02:10.740> literally<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.310> mess<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.570> would<00:02:12.690> expect

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it's literally a mess you would expect

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's literally a mess you would expect
this<00:02:13.890> week<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> picture

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
this week to be like it is on a picture

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 
this week to be like it is on a picture
and<00:02:19.110> maybe<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.190> looks<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.550> way<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.150> guess

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
and maybe it looks that way but I guess
