00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the piece of material on a disc and then

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.550 
the piece of material on a disc and then
you<00:01:28.650> apply<00:01:28.980> weight<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:30.080> when<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.200> apply<00:01:31.500> the

you apply weight and when you apply the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
you apply weight and when you apply the
weight<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.130> will<00:01:32.430> detect<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> hole<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
done on the material and substrate so it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
done on the material and substrate so it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
injustice continual
it'll<00:01:41.700> detect<00:01:41.970> yeah<00:01:42.300> any<00:01:42.480> hole<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:43.080> beauty<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it'll detect yeah any hole the beauty of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
it'll detect yeah any hole the beauty of
what<00:01:43.620> we<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.190> our<00:01:44.640> samples<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.450> run

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
what we do is our samples are run

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
what we do is our samples are run
through<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.140> through<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.650> production<00:01:46.830> line

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
through this through the production line

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.410 
through this through the production line
so<00:01:47.520> there's<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.820> separate<00:01:48.210> sample

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so there's not a separate sample

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.930 
so there's not a separate sample
department<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.200> which<00:01:49.470> does<00:01:49.770> things<00:01:50.430> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
particular so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.170 
particular so
goes<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.590> into<00:01:52.770> general<00:01:53.159> production<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
goes right into general production so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.310
