00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.360
 a heartfelt of well started the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.559
 encounter and especially to show the image 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.160
 of the France team because it's 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.890
 true that facing Columbia has known 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.440
 necessarily a disillusionment 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.610
 it was important to react immediately and 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.830
 and it's done 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.420
 by the way the first minute with Marie 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.280
 laure I will have a very good start 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810
 our part 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.030
 here we tried to put the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.580
 instructions at once jean place to go 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.010
 look pretty enough to the top 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.060
 prevent from raising and then here at 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.910
 end of the 16th minute 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.980
 there was already 3 0 so obviously not 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.110
 the match folded but inevitably we take 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.360
 a psychological advance and lately 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.880
 the rolls are unwound and after we return 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.100
 two half-time will necessarily a small 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.720
 little in a management because there are some 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.300
 back margins but still staying 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.309
 serious applied respect 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.230
 the opponent and then behind we conclude 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.059
 with a beautiful goal of amandine so 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.890
 all the better for us and we have to keep 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.150
 that spirit here to the end you 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 really show the image of the team 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.050
 de france in front of Colombia we did 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 a no match and it was important to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.130
 react collectively and I think we 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.520
 did it we did it tonight beautiful 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.800
 way 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 we had some nice goals we had 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.860
 nice actions too so that's 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.409
 important to continue like this from 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.479
 keep the campus mindset continued 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.030
 here we are, we learned at the end of the match 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.280
 the result of england so we are 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.010
 necessarily satisfied we will return to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.270
 Montreal is and we will see tonight against 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.100
 who we play we are really in the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.899
 competition and there I think we have 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.360
 showed the true face of the team 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.710
 France I think we finish first 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.259
 of our group too so that's 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.509
 really a satisfaction and we were 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.729
 returned frustrated from our matches 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.469
 previous ones but then we all let go and we 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.079
 can be proud of us tonight a lot 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.340
 pressure before the game but no 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.860
 bad pressure good pressure 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 because as I say we had to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.460
 catch up and so already ben the goal of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.170
 marie-laure releases us and then 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.539
 it goes on I think we have 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.190
 put our game as usual we could 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.680
 to make our possession of ball is so 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
 after the goals are linked in first 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.070
 half time I made two three strokes 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.960
 they are really not part is 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.670
 long there I was lucky it's on 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.950
 the last hits and ben it's fly 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.280
 so I hope I'll have 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.840
 other 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.510
 yeah that's for sure I can not dream 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.460
 the better it did it was really 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.090
 part of the help but dreams marked in 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.920
 world Cup 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.070
 to be voted best player of a match 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.380
 after that I have left me more 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.110
 dreams but I would say later when they 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.330
 will come true football is not a 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.130
 exact science so sometimes that's like 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.410
 today 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.570
 you do a very very very very good 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.770
 match and old but here we are 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.420
 it's like everyone is 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.890
 much less well so I believe it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.230
 have to stay very very measured in putting 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.420
 a pressure on a defeat and we 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.780
 incense on one on a series of 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.980
 victories 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.210
 So here we measured we were there 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.820
 did we did the job 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.270
 and then here we are 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.130
 search 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.500
 we have been looking for them very very high 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.300
 pressed them started that are 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.830
 players who are very very good 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.870
 technically there could never 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.530
 develop their game but 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.170
 teaching is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 that I have a group an expanded group that 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.329
 I have the option of two to do 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.280
 turn without the level of the team 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.540
 5 the level of the team goes down and that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.700
 it's a very very good 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.170
 yes thing happy for girls because 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.280
 that they did they did a great 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.230
 match what with the tempo plan 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.290
 they managed to manage the highlights and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.190
 weak times in alternating short game 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.010
 long game 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.019
 so we scored goals for a long time 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.390
 two inefficiency of the team's 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.459
 France is nothing to nothing there are five 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.060
 so that's good it's good for her 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.659
 it's good for the trust of the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.659
 group confidence
