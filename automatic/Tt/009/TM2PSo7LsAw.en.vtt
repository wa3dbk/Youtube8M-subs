is advance to the next slide how many

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
is advance to the next slide how many
people<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.159> augmented<00:01:59.700> reality<00:01:59.729> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
people know what augmented reality is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.219 
people know what augmented reality is
how<00:02:00.420> many<00:02:00.570> people<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> seen<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
how many people have seen it and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.630 
how many people have seen it and
understand<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.430> doesn't

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
understand it can I get it and doesn't

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.980 
understand it can I get it and doesn't
doesn't<00:02:03.090> count<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.420> saw<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.780> break

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
doesn't count if you saw it in the break

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.359 
doesn't count if you saw it in the break
room<00:02:04.020> only<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:04.799> seen<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.250> before

room only if you actually seen it before

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.950 
room only if you actually seen it before
you<00:02:05.579> got<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.939> okay<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> fair<00:02:06.869> amount

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you got here okay that's a fair amount

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
you got here okay that's a fair amount
so<00:02:07.590> augmented<00:02:08.039> having<00:02:08.369> been<00:02:08.550> made<00:02:08.759> greater<00:02:09.119> in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
so augmented having been made greater in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600 
so augmented having been made greater in

reality<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.330> think<00:02:12.720> now

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
reality I think now

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
reality I think now
that<00:02:13.230> superimposes<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.070> computer-generated

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that superimposes a computer-generated

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
that superimposes a computer-generated
image<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.720> user's<00:02:16.110> view<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> real<00:02:16.950> world

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
image on a user's view of the real world

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.950 
image on a user's view of the real world
that's<00:02:17.610> providing<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.240> composite<00:02:18.870> view<00:02:20.960> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
that's providing a composite view and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.080 
that's providing a composite view and
there<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.440> are<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> get<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.910> bit

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
there we are so to get you a little bit

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.460 
there we are so to get you a little bit
excited<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.720> augmented<00:02:24.870> reality<00:02:25.140> I'm

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
excited about augmented reality I'm

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.570 
excited about augmented reality I'm
going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> walk<00:02:25.980> through<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.490> of

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
going to walk through a little bit of

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.730 
going to walk through a little bit of
Technology<00:02:26.850> history<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.570> everyone<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
Technology history for everyone so you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.380 
Technology history for everyone so you
can<00:02:28.860> imagine<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> back<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.820> time<00:02:30.030> -

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
can imagine if you go back in time -

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.560 
can imagine if you go back in time -
there's<00:02:30.900> no<00:02:31.020> television<00:02:31.350> simply<00:02:32.000> radio<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
there's no television simply radio so

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.940 
there's no television simply radio so
then<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> sudden<00:02:34.200> television<00:02:34.800> comes

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
then all of a sudden television comes

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.950 
then all of a sudden television comes
along<00:02:35.130> well<00:02:35.250> what<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.910> first<00:02:36.210> television

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
along well what is the first television

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.600 
along well what is the first television
show<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.860> anybody<00:02:38.160> remember<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.460> actual

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
show is anybody remember the actual

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.860 
show is anybody remember the actual
first<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:40.020> yeah<00:02:40.920> yes<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:42.090> particularly<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
first but yeah yes but particularly the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.480 
first but yeah yes but particularly the
first<00:02:43.050> television<00:02:43.530> show<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
first television show is actually a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.350 
first television show is actually a
videotaped<00:02:45.800> radio<00:02:46.800> show<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.910> brings<00:02:48.150> us

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
videotaped radio show so that brings us

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.850 
videotaped radio show so that brings us
to<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> theory<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:48.990> technology<00:02:49.290> kind

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to the theory that all technology kind

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.980 
to the theory that all technology kind
of<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.400> some<00:02:50.430> ways<00:02:50.790> copies<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.450> technology

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
of in some ways copies of technology

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.870 
of in some ways copies of technology
before<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.220> reason<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.670> is

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
before it and the reason for that is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.430 
before it and the reason for that is
we're<00:02:54.030> still<00:02:54.300> grasping<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:54.990> understanding

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
we're still grasping and understanding

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.900 
we're still grasping and understanding
how<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.070> technology<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.760> that's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
how to use that technology and that's

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.040 
how to use that technology and that's
what's<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.180> exciting<00:02:57.270> about<00:02:57.600> where<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:58.020> are

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
what's so exciting about where we are

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.190 
what's so exciting about where we are
right<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.770> augmented<00:02:59.190> reality

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
right now with augmented reality

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.090 
right now with augmented reality
television<00:03:01.200> comes<00:03:01.350> along<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.830> whole<00:03:01.950> new

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
television comes along it's a whole new

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.949 
television comes along it's a whole new
media<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.400> moving<00:03:02.730> images<00:03:03.090> information<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
media and moving images information the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.480 
media and moving images information the
web<00:03:04.140> comes<00:03:04.440> along<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.920> becomes<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.340> whole

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
web comes along that becomes a whole

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.790 
web comes along that becomes a whole
mean<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:06.540> we've<00:03:06.690> got<00:03:06.840> mobile<00:03:07.020> phones<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.709> can

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
mean now we've got mobile phones you can

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.199 
mean now we've got mobile phones you can
do<00:03:07.980> things<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:08.190> change<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.640> slide<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.090> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
do things like change the slide with it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.690 
do things like change the slide with it
remotely<00:03:09.480> over<00:03:09.720> Wi-Fi<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.459> look<00:03:11.550> up

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
remotely over Wi-Fi but you can look up

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.250 
remotely over Wi-Fi but you can look up
information<00:03:12.000> about<00:03:12.420> anywhere<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.050> world

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
information about anywhere in the world

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.440 
information about anywhere in the world
from<00:03:13.770> your<00:03:13.950> mobile<00:03:14.130> phone<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:15.000> what's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
from your mobile phone and now what's

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.880 
from your mobile phone and now what's
been<00:03:15.600> called<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.990> eighth<00:03:16.170> mass<00:03:16.440> medium

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
been called the eighth mass medium

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.979 
been called the eighth mass medium
augmented<00:03:17.430> reality<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.390> now<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.660> gets<00:03:18.810> really

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
augmented reality so now it gets really

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.630 
augmented reality so now it gets really
exciting<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.590> literally<00:03:19.830> point<00:03:20.519> your

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
exciting you can literally point your

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.370 
exciting you can literally point your
device<00:03:20.940> at<00:03:21.150> something<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.720> learn<00:03:21.959> about<00:03:22.110> it

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
device at something and learn about it

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.840 
device at something and learn about it
and<00:03:22.470> interact<00:03:22.739> with<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.459> way<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.760> you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and interact with it in a way that you

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
and interact with it in a way that you
never<00:03:24.030> could<00:03:24.300> before<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.230> it's<00:03:25.350> an<00:03:25.440> amazing

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
never could before so it's an amazing

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.090 
never could before so it's an amazing
exciting<00:03:26.280> time<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:28.500> best<00:03:28.709> thing<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.860> do<00:03:29.010> is

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
exciting time the best thing to do is

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.259 
exciting time the best thing to do is
actually<00:03:29.190> I'll<00:03:29.430> tell<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.640> some<00:03:29.790> stories<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
actually I'll tell you some stories and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.300 
actually I'll tell you some stories and
actually<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.989> show<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> technology<00:03:31.950> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
actually just to show the technology to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.259 
actually just to show the technology to
you<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.670> we'll<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.209> little

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you so we'll just do a little

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.699 
you so we'll just do a little
demonstration<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.200> we'll<00:03:34.320> kind<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.560> walk

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
demonstration and we'll kind of walk

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.590 
demonstration and we'll kind of walk
through<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> we'll<00:03:39.030> bring<00:03:39.269> up<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.420> house

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
through so we'll bring up the house

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.850 
through so we'll bring up the house
lights<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.019> I'll<00:03:40.110> actually<00:03:40.200> walk<00:03:40.500> out<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
lights and I'll actually walk out in the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.290 
lights and I'll actually walk out in the
audience<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.489> really<00:03:41.730> great<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:41.940> kind<00:03:42.180> of

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
audience it's really great to kind of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.960 
audience it's really great to kind of
see<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.019> hold<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.800> in<00:03:43.920> your<00:03:44.010> hand<00:03:44.250> but<00:03:44.519> in

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
see it and hold it in your hand but in

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.640 
see it and hold it in your hand but in
this<00:03:45.330> case<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:45.690> have<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> map<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> city

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
this case I just have a map of the city

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.460 
this case I just have a map of the city
and<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.220> application<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.300> we<00:03:48.470> that

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
and this is the application that we that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.390 
and this is the application that we that
we<00:03:49.590> built<00:03:49.830> for<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:52.019> imagine

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
we built for you but now you can imagine

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.390 
we built for you but now you can imagine
the<00:03:54.200> implications<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.350> actually<00:03:55.830> using<00:03:56.310> this

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the implications and actually using this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.310 
the implications and actually using this
as<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> design<00:03:57.120> tool<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.750> many<00:03:57.870> people<00:03:58.140> say

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
as a design tool and many people say

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.900 
as a design tool and many people say
well<00:03:58.350> what<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.830> know<00:03:58.950> what<00:03:59.130> can<00:03:59.400> what<00:03:59.610> can<00:03:59.790> be

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
well what you know what can what can be

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.759 
well what you know what can what can be
done<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.360> well<00:04:00.570> let's<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
done with this well let's see the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.740 
done with this well let's see the
imagine<00:04:02.100> we're<00:04:02.310> building<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.820> wind<00:04:03.060> farm<00:04:03.300> here

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
imagine we're building a wind farm here

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.410 
imagine we're building a wind farm here
and<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.080> want<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.380> decide<00:04:04.650> just<00:04:05.000> like<00:04:06.000> Iron<00:04:06.239> Man

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and we want to decide just like Iron Man

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.000 
and we want to decide just like Iron Man
did<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:06.720> his<00:04:06.780> lab<00:04:06.959> where<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.769> put<00:04:07.950> a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
did in his lab where do I want to put a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.800 
did in his lab where do I want to put a
windmill

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
windmill

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.390 
windmill
how<00:04:09.810> many<00:04:09.989> windmills<00:04:10.410> do<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.590> need<00:04:10.830> if<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.130> put<00:04:11.370> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
how many windmills do I need if I put a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.240 
how many windmills do I need if I put a
windmill<00:04:11.820> here<00:04:12.209> how<00:04:13.110> does<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.410> impact<00:04:13.590> if<00:04:14.160> I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
windmill here how does that impact if I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.710 
windmill here how does that impact if I
live<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:14.700> hill<00:04:14.910> around<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.269> corner<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
live on this hill around the corner the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.789 
live on this hill around the corner the
view<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.169> windmill<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.680> can

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
view of the windmill and you can

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.699 
view of the windmill and you can
actually<00:04:16.979> move<00:04:17.280> around<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.440> see<00:04:19.440> from

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
actually move around it and see from

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.320 
actually move around it and see from
different<00:04:19.859> angles<00:04:20.400> how<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.669> would<00:04:20.910> actually

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
different angles how you would actually

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.629 
different angles how you would actually
see<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.010> actual<00:04:23.010> world<00:04:23.430> yeah<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.000> amazing

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
see the actual world yeah it's amazing

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.520 
see the actual world yeah it's amazing
amazingly<00:04:25.120> fun<00:04:25.360> technology<00:04:25.810> I'm<00:04:26.139> very<00:04:26.349> proud

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
amazingly fun technology I'm very proud

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.469 
amazingly fun technology I'm very proud
I'm<00:04:26.680> very<00:04:26.860> proud<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.039> my<00:04:27.189> tracking<00:04:27.819> technology

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
I'm very proud of my tracking technology

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.510 
I'm very proud of my tracking technology
I<00:04:28.509> can<00:04:28.659> actually<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.800> know<00:04:29.830> do<00:04:30.099> crazy<00:04:30.340> things

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
I can actually you know do crazy things

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.999 
I can actually you know do crazy things
like<00:04:30.789> this<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.409> somewhat<00:04:32.409> we'll<00:04:32.560> continue<00:04:32.710> to

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
like this and somewhat we'll continue to

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.029 
like this and somewhat we'll continue to
track<00:04:33.479> but<00:04:34.479> in<00:04:34.689> this<00:04:35.139> technology<00:04:35.409> has<00:04:35.770> ways

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
track but in this technology has ways

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.290 
track but in this technology has ways
that<00:04:36.249> we<00:04:36.310> haven't<00:04:36.580> even<00:04:36.669> thought<00:04:36.879> of<00:04:36.939> yet<00:04:37.090> and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
that we haven't even thought of yet and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.399 
that we haven't even thought of yet and
that's<00:04:37.360> what's<00:04:37.569> great<00:04:37.749> have<00:04:37.960> been<00:04:38.050> talking

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
that's what's great have been talking

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.830 
that's what's great have been talking
about<00:04:38.499> all<00:04:39.129> of<00:04:39.219> you<00:04:39.340> about<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.819> imagine<00:04:40.810> that

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
about all of you about so imagine that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.610 
about all of you about so imagine that
you<00:04:41.229> take<00:04:42.659> a<00:04:43.659> tour<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:44.020> Ojai<00:04:44.289> and<00:04:44.439> you<00:04:44.499> can

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
you take a tour of Ojai and you can

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.989 
you take a tour of Ojai and you can
point<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.919> buildings<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.550> learn<00:04:45.639> about<00:04:45.849> those

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:45.999 
point to buildings and learn about those

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:47.879 
point to buildings and learn about those
buildings<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.659> how<00:04:46.779> they<00:04:46.930> were<00:04:46.990> many<00:04:47.680> years

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
buildings and how they were many years

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.249 
buildings and how they were many years
ago<00:04:48.099> or<00:04:48.490> how<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.240> were<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.569> future<00:04:49.930> or

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
ago or how they were in the future or

whole<00:06:29.500> idea<00:06:30.430> of<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.580> sharing<00:06:30.849> economy<00:06:30.939> and<00:06:31.569> the

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
whole idea of a sharing economy and the

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.240 
whole idea of a sharing economy and the
sharing<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.110> information<00:06:32.259> and<00:06:32.709> we<00:06:32.830> really<00:06:33.069> see

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
sharing of information and we really see

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.309 
sharing of information and we really see
this<00:06:33.339> as<00:06:33.399> being<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:34.300> next<00:06:34.419> medium<00:06:34.870> to<00:06:35.110> share

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
this as being the next medium to share

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.740 
this as being the next medium to share
information<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:36.129> a<00:06:36.219> much<00:06:36.370> more<00:06:36.580> fun<00:06:37.300> but<00:06:37.599> also

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
information and a much more fun but also

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.480 
information and a much more fun but also
engaging

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
engaging

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.570 
engaging
an<00:06:38.580> interactive<00:06:39.240> way<00:06:40.220> you<00:06:41.220> know<00:06:41.340> so<00:06:41.460> I<00:06:41.490> think

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
an interactive way you know so I think

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.760 
an interactive way you know so I think
our<00:06:41.849> call<00:06:42.090> to<00:06:42.240> action<00:06:42.270> right<00:06:42.569> now<00:06:42.750> is<00:06:43.199> just<00:06:43.500> to

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
our call to action right now is just to

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.070 
our call to action right now is just to
never<00:06:44.310> stop<00:06:44.639> exploring<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.509> never<00:06:45.780> stop

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
never stop exploring and never stop

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.770 
never stop exploring and never stop
learning<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.310> never<00:06:47.610> stop<00:06:47.910> adding<00:06:48.389> these<00:06:48.569> new

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
learning and never stop adding these new

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.120 
learning and never stop adding these new
dimensions<00:06:49.229> because<00:06:49.590> these<00:06:49.680> new<00:06:49.889> dimensions

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
dimensions because these new dimensions

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.760 
dimensions because these new dimensions
add<00:06:50.639> new<00:06:51.389> layers<00:06:51.599> of<00:06:51.900> information<00:06:52.110> which

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
add new layers of information which

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.950 
add new layers of information which
really<00:06:53.130> is<00:06:53.370> a<00:06:53.400> different<00:06:54.360> perspective<00:06:54.569> a

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
really is a different perspective a

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.290 
really is a different perspective a
different<00:06:54.990> view<00:06:55.410> of<00:06:55.440> the<00:06:55.530> world<00:06:55.620> a<00:06:56.550> different

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
different view of the world a different

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.689 
different view of the world a different
point<00:06:57.479> of<00:06:57.539> view<00:06:57.750> and<00:06:58.009> we're<00:06:59.009> excited<00:06:59.280> this<00:06:59.639> is

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
point of view and we're excited this is

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.170 
point of view and we're excited this is
a<00:06:59.910> you<00:07:00.509> know<00:07:00.630> technologies<00:07:01.199> like<00:07:01.410> this<00:07:01.590> are

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
a you know technologies like this are

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.249 
a you know technologies like this are
literally<00:07:03.180> what<00:07:03.479> helped<00:07:03.720> change<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:04.020> world
