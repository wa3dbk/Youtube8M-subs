00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
with three people so you'll see some of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
with three people so you'll see some of
us<00:01:10.080> making<00:01:10.350> multiple<00:01:10.650> trips<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> was

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
us making multiple trips but that was

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
us making multiple trips but that was
the<00:01:12.090> fire<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.600> where<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> saw<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the fire one where you saw it in the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.609 
the fire one where you saw it in the
main<00:01:13.920> dig<00:01:14.189> site<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.080> spawn<00:01:16.350> one

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
main dig site and this is the spawn one

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.969 
main dig site and this is the spawn one
so<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.130> means<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.970> lightning<00:01:18.979> once
