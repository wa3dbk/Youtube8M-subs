it<00:00:22.289> number<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.740> most<00:00:22.949> important<00:00:23.400> thing<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it number one most important thing is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
it number one most important thing is
this<00:00:24.180> blow-dryer<00:00:24.689> right<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> don't

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this blow-dryer right here you don't

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.810 
this blow-dryer right here you don't
necessarily<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.310> blow-dryer

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
necessarily have to have this blow-dryer

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
necessarily have to have this blow-dryer
but<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.480> really<00:00:27.840> like<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.140> load<00:00:28.320> dryer<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> lot

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
but I really like this load dryer a lot

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.669 
but I really like this load dryer a lot
it's<00:00:29.070> by<00:00:29.220> GHD<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.380> light

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
it's by GHD I like it because it's light

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
it's by GHD I like it because it's light
that<00:00:31.949> has<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> cooling<00:00:32.460> button<00:00:32.910> right<00:00:33.390> here<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that has a cooling button right here it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
that has a cooling button right here it
gets<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.350> hot<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.800> well<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> has

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
gets really hot as well and then it has

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
gets really hot as well and then it has
this<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.000> good<00:00:36.329> directional<00:00:37.110> nozzle<00:00:37.469> on

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this really good directional nozzle on

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.959 
this really good directional nozzle on
the<00:00:37.649> front<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> most<00:00:38.190> important<00:00:38.670> part<00:00:38.910> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the front the most important part of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
the front the most important part of
this<00:00:39.120> belowed<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.600> whole<00:00:39.870> blow<00:00:40.110> dryer<00:00:40.410> thing

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
this belowed your whole blow dryer thing

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
this belowed your whole blow dryer thing
is<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.219> directional<00:00:41.730> nozzle<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
is the directional nozzle I want you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
is the directional nozzle I want you
guys<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.530> careful<00:00:43.890> not<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.280> like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
guys to be really careful not to like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.279 
guys to be really careful not to like
throw<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> box<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.239> keep<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.930> thing<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
throw the box out and keep this thing in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.840 
throw the box out and keep this thing in
there<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> direction<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> nozzle<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
there the direction of nozzle is really

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
there the direction of nozzle is really
important<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:49.079> blows<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.010> air

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
important because it blows the air

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.840 
important because it blows the air
exactly<00:00:51.090> where<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:52.699> if<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
exactly where you want it to go if you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
exactly where you want it to go if you
have<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> blow-dryer<00:00:54.510> without<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> nozzle

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
have the blow-dryer without the nozzle

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
have the blow-dryer without the nozzle
like<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.010> necessarily<00:00:56.190> know

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like this you don't necessarily know

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
like this you don't necessarily know
where<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> air<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.050> all

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
where the air is going that's going all

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
where the air is going that's going all
over<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.090> being<00:01:00.300> diffused

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
over the place and it's being diffused

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
over the place and it's being diffused
and<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.289> hair<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.280> smooth

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and your hair is gonna not be smooth

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
and your hair is gonna not be smooth
straight<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.809> tame<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.710> could<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> if

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
straight and as tame as it could be if

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.800 
straight and as tame as it could be if
you<00:01:05.250> add<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.610> directional<00:01:06.060> nozzle<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.570> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you add this directional nozzle on here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.539 
you add this directional nozzle on here
I<00:01:06.900> find<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> directional<00:01:08.040> nozzle<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I find that the directional nozzle is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.340 
I find that the directional nozzle is
really<00:01:08.790> helpful<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.630> allows<00:01:09.659> me<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
really helpful because it allows me to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.200 
really helpful because it allows me to
blow<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> hair<00:01:11.070> exactly<00:01:11.460> where<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
blow the hair exactly where I want it to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.330 
blow the hair exactly where I want it to
go<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> heat<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> exact<00:01:13.770> spot<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> I'm

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
go and heat up the exact spot that I'm

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
go and heat up the exact spot that I'm
brushing<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.030> gives<00:01:15.210> me<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> lot<00:01:15.630> more

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
brushing just gives me a lot more
