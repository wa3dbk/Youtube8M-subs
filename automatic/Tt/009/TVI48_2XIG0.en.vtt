test to see if an SSD would help me I

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.469 
test to see if an SSD would help me I
decided<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:34.489> go<00:00:34.579> ahead<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.819> buy<00:00:34.909> one<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.300> do

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:35.479 
decided to go ahead and buy one and do

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.200 
decided to go ahead and buy one and do
some<00:00:35.659> benchmarks<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.429> find<00:00:37.909> out<00:00:38.030> for

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
some benchmarks and and find out for

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.389 
some benchmarks and and find out for
myself<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:38.809> I'd<00:00:39.289> like<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.530> share<00:00:39.949> this<00:00:40.129> video

my computer's performance and maybe this

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.979

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
it holds its own or if it's a little bit

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.439 
hard drive it couldn't even scratch it's
almost<00:05:31.380> it's<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.770> know<00:05:32.860> it's<00:05:33.220> like<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:34.030> solid

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
almost it's you know it's like the solid

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.140 
almost it's you know it's like the solid
state<00:05:34.659> is<00:05:34.810> about<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.080> third<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.789> boot<00:05:36.970> up

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
state is about a third of the boot up

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.990 
state is about a third of the boot up
time<00:05:37.389> running<00:05:38.050> ten<00:05:38.289> programs<00:05:38.789> part<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:39.909> that's

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
time running ten programs part of that's

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.580 
time running ten programs part of that's
due<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.449> the<00:05:40.479> fact<00:05:40.720> that<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.229> solid-state

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
due to the fact that the solid-state

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.610 
due to the fact that the solid-state
disk<00:05:41.919> have<00:05:42.419> access<00:05:43.419> times<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.960> 0.1

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
disk have access times of 0.1

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.850 
disk have access times of 0.1
millisecond<00:05:45.340> where<00:05:46.199> general<00:05:47.199> hard<00:05:47.380> drives<00:05:47.650> go

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
millisecond where general hard drives go

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.610 
millisecond where general hard drives go
anywhere<00:05:48.190> from<00:05:48.430> 6<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:49.060> 12<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.900> maybe<00:05:50.080> 15<00:05:50.590> or

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
anywhere from 6 to 12 to maybe 15 or

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.830 
anywhere from 6 to 12 to maybe 15 or
higher<00:05:50.830> on<00:05:51.250> an<00:05:51.370> older<00:05:51.669> drive<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.240> gives

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
higher on an older drive and that gives

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.050 
higher on an older drive and that gives
them<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:53.050> huge<00:05:53.199> advantage<00:05:53.650> what<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.639> did<00:05:54.880> notice

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
them a huge advantage what I did notice

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.850 
them a huge advantage what I did notice
though<00:05:55.360> was<00:05:55.720> with<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.139> solid-state<00:05:56.470> drive

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
though was with the solid-state drive

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.800 
though was with the solid-state drive
it's<00:05:57.099> almost<00:05:57.400> as<00:05:57.639> if<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.940> applications<00:05:58.630> are

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
it's almost as if the applications are

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.570 
it's almost as if the applications are
already<00:05:59.020> there<00:05:59.440> like<00:05:59.710> if<00:05:59.860> you<00:05:59.979> if<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.370> just

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
already there like if you if you just

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.700 
already there like if you if you just
boot<00:06:00.820> it<00:06:00.940> up<00:06:01.060> nothing's<00:06:01.539> in<00:06:01.720> memory<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:02.229> you

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
boot it up nothing's in memory and you

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.620 
boot it up nothing's in memory and you
run<00:06:02.919> Photoshop<00:06:03.610> or<00:06:03.820> you<00:06:03.909> run<00:06:04.060> Word<00:06:04.330> or<00:06:04.539> Excel

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
run Photoshop or you run Word or Excel

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.320 
run Photoshop or you run Word or Excel
or<00:06:05.110> anything<00:06:05.320> large<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.430> drive<00:06:06.669> is<00:06:06.849> so<00:06:07.030> fast

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
or anything large the drive is so fast

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.969 
or anything large the drive is so fast
it<00:06:07.690> just<00:06:07.930> pops<00:06:08.169> right<00:06:08.380> on<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.650> screen<00:06:08.949> just

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
it just pops right on the screen just

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.710 
it just pops right on the screen just
like<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.580> had<00:06:09.760> already<00:06:09.940> been<00:06:10.240> in<00:06:10.449> and<00:06:10.599> out<00:06:10.659> of

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
like you had already been in and out of

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.140 
like you had already been in and out of
it

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
it

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.820 
it
and<00:06:11.420> then<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.660> second<00:06:12.020> time<00:06:12.230> it<00:06:12.410> just<00:06:12.590> comes

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
and then that second time it just comes

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.100 
and then that second time it just comes
right<00:06:13.040> up<00:06:13.220> but<00:06:13.640> that's<00:06:14.240> not<00:06:14.480> the<00:06:14.630> case<00:06:14.810> it's

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
right up but that's not the case it's

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.600 
right up but that's not the case it's
the<00:06:15.290> first<00:06:15.530> time<00:06:15.710> it<00:06:15.860> loads<00:06:16.010> it<00:06:16.250> learns<00:06:16.460> so

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
the first time it loads it learns so

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.430 
the first time it loads it learns so
quick<00:06:16.880> it's<00:06:17.060> almost<00:06:17.330> unnoticeable<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.290> it's

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
quick it's almost unnoticeable that it's

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.620 
quick it's almost unnoticeable that it's
even<00:06:18.680> loading<00:06:18.980> anything<00:06:19.340> it<00:06:19.460> disappears<00:06:20.030> so<00:06:20.390> I

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
even loading anything it disappears so I

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.240 
even loading anything it disappears so I
think<00:06:21.140> we<00:06:21.410> have<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.560> hands-down<00:06:21.950> winner

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
think we have a hands-down winner

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.740 
think we have a hands-down winner
definitely<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.900> OCZ<00:06:24.290> vertex<00:06:24.980> -<00:06:25.310> I<00:06:25.910> have<00:06:26.630> the

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
definitely the OCZ vertex - I have the

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.750 
definitely the OCZ vertex - I have the
50<00:06:27.140> gigabyte<00:06:27.620> which<00:06:27.860> if<00:06:28.010> you<00:06:28.070> have<00:06:28.160> Windows<00:06:28.460> 7

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
50 gigabyte which if you have Windows 7

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.950 
50 gigabyte which if you have Windows 7
you<00:06:28.850> don't<00:06:29.030> want<00:06:29.150> to<00:06:29.240> keep<00:06:29.390> that<00:06:29.600> unless<00:06:29.840> you

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
you don't want to keep that unless you

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.330 
you don't want to keep that unless you
have<00:06:30.080> like<00:06:30.110> a<00:06:30.200> laptop<00:06:30.710> or<00:06:30.860> something<00:06:31.220> that

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
have like a laptop or something that

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.460 
have like a laptop or something that
you're<00:06:31.460> not<00:06:31.580> going<00:06:31.730> to<00:06:31.790> load<00:06:32.000> up<00:06:32.030> but<00:06:32.840> I<00:06:32.870> think

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
you're not going to load up but I think

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.440 
you're not going to load up but I think
at<00:06:33.920> my<00:06:34.070> near<00:06:34.220> future<00:06:34.250> I'll<00:06:34.760> be<00:06:34.790> purchasing<00:06:35.390> a

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
at my near future I'll be purchasing a

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.150 
at my near future I'll be purchasing a
much<00:06:35.600> larger<00:06:36.080> version<00:06:36.260> of<00:06:36.530> that<00:06:36.710> because<00:06:36.950> that

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
much larger version of that because that

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.610 
much larger version of that because that
just<00:06:37.190> blew<00:06:37.670> me<00:06:37.850> away<00:06:37.880> it<00:06:38.240> went<00:06:38.420> from<00:06:38.600> 30<00:06:38.900> 3.1

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
just blew me away it went from 30 3.1

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.940 
just blew me away it went from 30 3.1
seconds<00:06:40.100> to<00:06:40.460> over<00:06:41.360> 1<00:06:41.570> minute<00:06:41.840> and<00:06:42.080> 30<00:06:42.140> seconds

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
seconds to over 1 minute and 30 seconds

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.610 
seconds to over 1 minute and 30 seconds
1<00:06:43.070> minute<00:06:43.100> 32<00:06:43.640> seconds<00:06:44.470> tremendous<00:06:45.470> time

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
1 minute 32 seconds tremendous time

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.520 
1 minute 32 seconds tremendous time
savings<00:06:46.100> so<00:06:46.310> I<00:06:46.520> highly<00:06:47.180> recommend<00:06:47.630> these<00:06:47.750> if

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
savings so I highly recommend these if

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.690 
savings so I highly recommend these if
you<00:06:48.800> want<00:06:48.980> to<00:06:49.040> make<00:06:49.190> one<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.430> the<00:06:49.580> biggest

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
you want to make one of the biggest

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.310 
you want to make one of the biggest
differences<00:06:50.330> to<00:06:50.510> your<00:06:50.630> computer<00:06:51.080> I'd

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
differences to your computer I'd

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.960 
differences to your computer I'd
strongly<00:06:51.680> recommend<00:06:51.800> getting<00:06:52.520> your<00:06:52.610> hands<00:06:52.850> on

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
strongly recommend getting your hands on

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.300 
strongly recommend getting your hands on
an<00:06:53.060> SSD<00:06:53.440> the<00:06:54.440> only<00:06:54.620> thing<00:06:54.800> you'll<00:06:54.920> have<00:06:55.040> to<00:06:55.100> do

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
an SSD the only thing you'll have to do

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.770 
an SSD the only thing you'll have to do
if<00:06:55.430> you<00:06:55.550> want<00:06:55.730> to<00:06:55.760> make<00:06:55.910> it<00:06:56.060> exactly<00:06:56.180> the<00:06:56.750> same

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
if you want to make it exactly the same

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.320 
if you want to make it exactly the same
like<00:06:57.290> I<00:06:57.440> did<00:06:57.650> is<00:06:57.860> use<00:06:58.550> a<00:06:58.580> program<00:06:59.060> like

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
like I did is use a program like

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.300 
like I did is use a program like
Symantec<00:06:59.900> ghost<00:06:59.930> or<00:07:00.500> another<00:07:00.680> disk<00:07:00.950> imaging

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
Symantec ghost or another disk imaging

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.520 
Symantec ghost or another disk imaging
program<00:07:01.730> to<00:07:02.240> make<00:07:02.390> an<00:07:02.510> exact<00:07:02.870> copy<00:07:02.900> from<00:07:03.440> one

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
program to make an exact copy from one

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.400 
program to make an exact copy from one
drive<00:07:03.920> to<00:07:04.130> the<00:07:04.280> other<00:07:04.660> also<00:07:05.660> as<00:07:05.930> far<00:07:06.080> as<00:07:06.260> I<00:07:06.350> know

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
drive to the other also as far as I know

all<00:07:06.890> of<00:07:06.920> the<00:07:07.130> SSDs<00:07:07.610> are<00:07:08.530> serial<00:07:09.530> ata<00:07:09.950> so<00:07:10.160> if<00:07:10.490> you

all of the SSDs are serial ata so if you

older hard drives the IDE ata hard
drives<00:07:15.860> I<00:07:16.130> don't<00:07:16.550> believe<00:07:17.000> they<00:07:17.240> have<00:07:17.270> a

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
drives I don't believe they have a

drives I don't believe they have a
product<00:07:17.930> available<00:07:18.350> at<00:07:18.470> this<00:07:18.620> time<00:07:18.860> I'd<00:07:19.310> have

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
product available at this time I'd have

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.980 
product available at this time I'd have
to<00:07:19.640> research<00:07:19.940> more<00:07:20.180> to<00:07:20.300> find<00:07:20.480> out<00:07:20.630> for<00:07:20.810> sure

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
to research more to find out for sure

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.720 
to research more to find out for sure
well<00:07:21.410> I<00:07:21.470> hope<00:07:21.590> these<00:07:21.770> results<00:07:22.160> helped<00:07:22.400> you<00:07:22.490> and

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
I look forward to doing more benchmarks

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.110 
I look forward to doing more benchmarks
and<00:07:24.920> tests<00:07:25.070> for<00:07:25.190> in<00:07:25.310> the<00:07:25.400> future<00:07:25.670> all<00:07:25.910> right
