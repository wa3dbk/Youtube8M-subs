00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is the part of the recipe that really

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
is the part of the recipe that really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
depends on the kind of protein powder

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.300 
depends on the kind of protein powder
that<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> use<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.590> you're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that you use what you're going to do is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.240 
that you use what you're going to do is
add<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.900> couple<00:01:16.110> tablespoons<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
add in water a couple tablespoons at a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
add in water a couple tablespoons at a
time<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> stir<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.840> up

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
time and then you're going to stir it up

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
time and then you're going to stir it up
so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> nice<00:01:19.920> thick<00:01:20.490> consistency<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so you get a nice thick consistency you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
so you get a nice thick consistency you
obviously<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:23.159> too

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
obviously don't want this to be too

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.570 
obviously don't want this to be too
liquidy<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.330> add<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:25.020> water<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> tablespoon<00:01:25.979> at

liquidy so add in water a tablespoon at
a<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.180> stir<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.840> each<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:32.150> so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
a time and then stir it up each time so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910 
a time and then stir it up each time so
with<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.450> protein<00:01:33.869> powder<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> did<00:01:34.710> was

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
with my protein powder what I did was

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
with my protein powder what I did was
add<00:01:35.189> around<00:01:35.700> six<00:01:36.060> tablespoons<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.900> water<00:01:37.079> and

add around six tablespoons of water and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
add around six tablespoons of water and
you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> good<00:01:38.280> look<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you can get a good look at the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can get a good look at the
consistency<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.290> nice<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> thick

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
consistency how it's nice and thick

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.490 
consistency how it's nice and thick
which<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.270> good<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.110> dipping

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
which is going to be good for dipping

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
which is going to be good for dipping
our<00:01:43.710> strawberries<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.820> remember<00:01:45.360> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
our strawberries into and remember you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
our strawberries into and remember you
don't<00:01:45.840> want<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.380> too<00:01:46.409> liquidy<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
don't want it to be too liquidy just a
