00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.480 

when<00:00:01.020> it<00:00:01.110> comes<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.500> pause<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:02.070> think<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.399> the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
when it comes to pause I think of the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.610 
when it comes to pause I think of the
front<00:00:02.760> path<00:00:03.030> from<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.449> road<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.049> house<00:00:04.290> or

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
front path from the road to the house or

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.930 
front path from the road to the house or
maybe<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.009> driveway<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.640> they're<00:00:05.790> usually

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
maybe the driveway and they're usually

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.330 
maybe the driveway and they're usually
well<00:00:06.390> designed<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.170> well<00:00:07.290> built<00:00:07.560> then<00:00:08.220> you

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
well designed and well built then you

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.160 
well designed and well built then you
come<00:00:08.490> out<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.820> back<00:00:09.030> yard<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.420> pass<00:00:09.780> tend

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
come out of the back yard and pass tend

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.990 
come out of the back yard and pass tend
to<00:00:10.260> evolve<00:00:10.559> well<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.610> better<00:00:11.820> than

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
to evolve well we can do better than

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910 
to evolve well we can do better than
this<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.570> gonna<00:00:12.719> show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> how<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> concrete

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
this I'm gonna show you how to concrete

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.860 
this I'm gonna show you how to concrete
trust<00:00:14.519> me<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:15.150> as<00:00:15.330> hard<00:00:15.570> as<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.839> think

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870

trust me it's not as hard as you think
it's<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:16.830> cost<00:00:17.340> effective<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.119> once<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it's very cost effective and once you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.460 
it's very cost effective and once you
get<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> roll

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
finished Heights here I want to be at
the<00:00:28.260> bottom<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:28.980> doorjamb<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.880> don't

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
get any water into the house and I have
a<00:00:31.740> step<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> other<00:00:32.489> end<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> need<00:00:33.450> to

a step at the other end so I need to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930 
a step at the other end so I need to
excavate<00:00:34.140> everything<00:00:34.649> below<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.460> hundred

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
excavate everything below that a hundred

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.420 
excavate everything below that a hundred
milk<00:00:36.180> hundred<00:00:36.870> mils<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.559> good<00:00:37.829> concrete

milk hundred mils a really good concrete

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240 
milk hundred mils a really good concrete
slab<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:39.420> thing<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> remember<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
slab one thing to remember is go about a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
slab one thing to remember is go about a
hundred<00:00:41.700> mil<00:00:41.850> wider<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.450> both<00:00:42.780> sides<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.410> your

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
hundred mil wider on both sides of your

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.590 
hundred mil wider on both sides of your
path<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.309> put<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> formwork<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.239> easy

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
path so you can put the formwork in easy

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.840 
path so you can put the formwork in easy
and<00:00:45.750> use<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> drill<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> tie<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.190> together

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.369 

so<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> finished<00:00:51.600> height<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so I've got the finished height here and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.420 
so I've got the finished height here and
I've<00:00:52.440> got<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> fuse<00:00:52.920> height<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> other

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I've got the fuse height of the other

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
I've got the fuse height of the other

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so when it transfers from this one to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.410 
so when it transfers from this one to
that<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.409> I'll<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> seamless<00:01:20.670> transition

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that one I'll have a seamless transition

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.179 
that one I'll have a seamless transition
from<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.780> timber<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> another<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
from one timber to another but if you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
from one timber to another but if you
come<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> end<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
come up the end you can see that this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920 
come up the end you can see that this
curve<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.799> quite<00:01:26.009> steep<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> pine<00:01:27.420> even

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
curve is quite steep and the pine even

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.270 
curve is quite steep and the pine even
though<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.080> wants<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> bend<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.710> bit<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
though it wants to bend a little bit it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
though it wants to bend a little bit it
doesn't<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> around<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.049> what

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
doesn't want to get around there so what

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the backside so when I squeeze them in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.710 
the backside so when I squeeze them in
I'll<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> stiffer<00:01:37.049> Bend<00:01:38.450> now<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I'll get a stiffer Bend now what you

because from now on I'll be working the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.330 
because from now on I'll be working the

concrete you noticed how dark the
concrete<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.970> well<00:02:33.480> we've<00:02:33.660> had<00:02:33.780> black<00:02:34.080> oxide

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
concrete is well we've had black oxide

mix through the whole batch who cost 65
bucks<00:02:37.470> extra<00:02:37.950> per<00:02:38.070> cubic<00:02:38.460> meter<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
bucks extra per cubic meter but it's a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.970 
bucks extra per cubic meter but it's a
good<00:02:39.720> investment<00:02:40.050> because<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.800> is

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
good investment because when this is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
boys are bringing the concrete in and a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.480 
boys are bringing the concrete in and a
nice<00:02:45.930> gentle<00:02:46.350> pace<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.740> me<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.130> work

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
nice gentle pace for me so I can work

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.510 
nice gentle pace for me so I can work
each<00:02:47.730> Barrow<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.350> roughly<00:02:49.709> level<00:02:49.950> if

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
each Barrow and get it roughly level if

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.010 
each Barrow and get it roughly level if
I<00:02:50.670> hadn't<00:02:50.910> backing<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.420> I'd<00:02:51.630> be<00:02:51.750> guessing

this path today so with the screen I go

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140 
this path today so with the screen I go
over<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.739> two<00:03:07.950> timber<00:03:08.370> edges<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.820> I've<00:03:08.940> got

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
over the two timber edges that I've got

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.210 
over the two timber edges that I've got
and<00:03:09.300> take<00:03:09.450> off<00:03:09.660> all<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.050> excess<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:11.040> why

and take off all the excess that's why

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.470 
and take off all the excess that's why
it's<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.430> important<00:03:12.030> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.239> put<00:03:12.390> your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it's really important when you put your

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's really important when you put your
stakes<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.959> if<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.620> get<00:03:13.800> them<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:14.010> lower

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
stakes in if you can get them down lower

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.640 
stakes in if you can get them down lower
than<00:03:14.520> your<00:03:14.790> edge<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.690> go<00:03:15.959> continuously

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
than your edge you can go continuously

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.199 
than your edge you can go continuously
now<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> look<00:03:17.520> at<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.910> think<00:03:18.000> I'm

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
now if you look at that and think I'm

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.880 
now if you look at that and think I'm
the<00:03:18.300> world's<00:03:18.570> worst<00:03:18.600> concreted<00:03:19.350> don't<00:03:19.590> worry

the world's worst concreted don't worry

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.160 
the world's worst concreted don't worry
all<00:03:20.160> I'm<00:03:20.370> doing<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.670> getting<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> height<00:03:21.420> once

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
all I'm doing is getting the height once

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.410 
all I'm doing is getting the height once
it<00:03:22.350> starts<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.860> set<00:03:23.160> that's<00:03:23.730> when<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.209> back

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
it starts to set that's when we go back

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.370 
it starts to set that's when we go back
and<00:03:24.570> play<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.170> give<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and play with it and give you the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.940 
and play with it and give you the
finished<00:03:25.769> look

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.140 

after<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> couple<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.310> hours<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> concrete's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
after a couple of hours the concrete's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.820 
after a couple of hours the concrete's
dry<00:03:30.420> enough<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:30.750> me<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.140> start<00:03:31.380> working<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
dry enough for me to start working it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.680 
dry enough for me to start working it
again<00:03:32.070> now<00:03:32.940> there's<00:03:33.180> lots<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.630> different

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
again now there's lots of different

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.480 
again now there's lots of different
finishes<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.560> can<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.340> can

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
finishes you can put on here you can

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.520 
finishes you can put on here you can
grab<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> bullfight<00:03:36.210> like<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.320> work

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
grab a bullfight like this and just work

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.760 
grab a bullfight like this and just work
in<00:03:37.740> little<00:03:37.980> circles<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.930> get<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.080> nice<00:03:40.290> texture

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
in little circles you get a nice texture

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.070 
in little circles you get a nice texture
up<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> when<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> dries<00:03:41.940> it's<00:03:42.480> got<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> bit<00:03:42.960> of

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
up and when it dries it's got a bit of

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.780 
up and when it dries it's got a bit of
grit<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.620> bit<00:03:43.770> of<00:03:43.890> texture<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.460> so<00:03:44.550> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
grit and a bit of texture to it so the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.700 
grit and a bit of texture to it so the
Sun<00:03:45.000> catches<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.900> looks<00:03:46.080> great

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
Sun catches it and it looks great

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.010 
Sun catches it and it looks great
the<00:03:47.580> last<00:03:47.790> job<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.270> put<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.480> some<00:03:48.660> movement

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
the last job is to put in some movement

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.840 
the last job is to put in some movement
cracks<00:03:49.230> into<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.590> slap<00:03:49.830> if<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.610> concrete

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
cracks into the slap if the concrete

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.580 
cracks into the slap if the concrete
does<00:03:51.240> crack<00:03:51.540> chances<00:03:52.080> are<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.320> will<00:03:52.410> crack

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
does crack chances are it will crack

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.010 
does crack chances are it will crack
along<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:52.950> line<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.460> then<00:03:54.360> leave<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.810> slope

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
along this line and then leave the slope

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.380 
along this line and then leave the slope
to<00:03:55.110> dry<00:03:55.320> for<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> week<00:03:55.740> or<00:03:55.920> two<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.180> week

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
to dry for a week or two it's a week

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.630 
to dry for a week or two it's a week
later<00:03:57.690> but<00:03:58.260> after<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.560> day<00:03:58.830> or<00:03:58.860> two<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.460> can

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
later but after a day or two you can

now<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.290> take<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.620> edges<00:04:01.920> off<00:04:04.670> give<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.850> seal

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
now is take the edges off give it a seal

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.070 
now is take the edges off give it a seal
and<00:04:06.330> we<00:04:06.570> are<00:04:06.780> done

well how much neater and tidier is this

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.930 
well how much neater and tidier is this
and<00:04:17.780> all<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.500> is<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.830> fraction<00:04:19.400> more<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.700> cost

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and all it is is a fraction more in cost
