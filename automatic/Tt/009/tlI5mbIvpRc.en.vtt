00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.959
 for those with what difference there is a tendency more than anything 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.200
 of year and the other one to second year 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.060
 because the agreement is perhaps accompanied by the agreements of the official program 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300
 but no text substitutions 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.269
 then teachers will meet with 100 thousand 1 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450
 they are going to see this workshop in them 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 this grace unpublished models other different 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.450
 but they complement each other and can be compensated to the extent that the 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.449
 teacher goes out to the rhythm of the song 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.230
 his exercise books 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 e the matica spelling punctuation 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.410
 enunciated reflective of these these aspects 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 and the teacher is going to serve him because they will meet with do exercises 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 that in a playful way in an autonomous enthusiastic way that the student can 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.870
 restore 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.660
 in those spaces 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.880
 that the moon has to recover certain avenues 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.010
 as they are just cartography the punctuation the textual recession 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.810
 and basically they are directed so that in those spaces the student can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.560
 develop those strategies 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 No substitution of textbooks but it will accompany it 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.270
 Basically we think the Count Diana in the proposal that is 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.180
 Of course we do in the classes, I think that there are students in the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.510
 sense that they reflexively use the tongue 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.250
 what do we think is the way it has 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.250
 d learn to write better 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.159
 the book has percent exceptions where by all score 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.659
 cohesion syntax are integrated and at the end of each chapter there is a play 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.879
 with the words 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.399
 so we must also count on 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.859
 with a lot of game because actually 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.319
 the tongue s 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 it's a game but yes 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:48.699
 escassi m Spanish we have a tsx space where we work in a 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.689
 personalized with the students 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.299
 more modern style bring a lot 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.689
 we believe that those spaces 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.519
 where the teacher is more directly with the world 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.519
 at the same time as it is an exercise book 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.419
 i the student can do at home different company or his family 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.639
 also with us we are creating we thought maybe the father wanted 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.139
 years ago who learns a grammar should be put here yay 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.260
 they are still talking about that type of their jeep explained that they will realize with a 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.049
 book that they would also like to approach new strategies 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.120
 because ultimately we all work together for the same reason why 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.980
 our children students wanted
