ago with him going all by himself so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.399 
ago with him going all by himself so
that<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.309> good<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:03.960> even<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that was really good I don't even have a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
that was really good I don't even have a
clue<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> looked<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:06.000> we'll<00:01:06.210> see

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
clue what it looked like but we'll see

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.520 
clue what it looked like but we'll see
what<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.540> looks<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:06.990> his<00:01:07.200> angle

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
what it looks like from his angle

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
what it looks like from his angle
because<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.040> that'll<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> fun

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
because I think that'll be kind of fun

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
because I think that'll be kind of fun
anyway<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.400> more

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
anyway so let's do it maybe one more

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.070 
anyway so let's do it maybe one more
time<00:01:11.700> come<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:14.450> sometimes<00:01:15.450> he<00:01:15.600> likes<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> throw
