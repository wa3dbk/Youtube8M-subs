00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.760
 we give morale to the field for the second consecutive year 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:14.229
 to follow the first steps of silver 2010 mion de mato grosso 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.199
 in meeting with elements and in Brazil 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.400
 we speak directly from the North Mato Grosso 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.840
 region where the state's largest soybean producer is concentrated 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.769
 and some of its municipalities 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.239
 then the kick-off of the Brazilian stage this year but the long 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.160
 during the dry season and complicated driving conditions. 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.610
 postponed the start of work and may have repercussions on the producer's 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.490
 and the clean that you want in the rural union of lucas of the green river with a cut in the 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.280
 hand security 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.320
 the only governor-in-office in the same period from 2010 to 2012 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.960
 the region is known to be the gateway to the national soybean crop 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 of agencies 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.770
 with the drought very honored prospect of rain delay 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 5 none of this happened 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 parents 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.200
 they will receive medals 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.650
 besides the prizes to compete the best prices in the beginning of 2011 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.260
 the delay in the planting of the oilseed 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.380
 may have other impacts 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.830
 mainly on hard female of the second phase 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 the wedge 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.410
 diagnosis was walking will be performed on Sunday evening 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.220
 I will not risk being canceled 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 However 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.250
 even with the concern of producers 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.000
 every city hall for the weekend that trusts me 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 and the planting of history begins already in the next days 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.290
 the safrinha corn for example may not have as much problem 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.679
 make it clear that time collaborates with hamburgers in urban Indians without 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.850
 these measures 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.590
 with the owners of 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.460
 according to the mayor Carlito 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.499
 and industry analysts 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.939
 to the custody house the effects of the delay of the rains are beneficial for 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:21.959
 While 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.159
 and here as technically explains cleyton 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.669
 planting within the month of September is not recommended 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.569
 even more with so many months without rain 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.789
 ef 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.439
 a year ago 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.749
 it's a damage 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.909
 as soon as 1min 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.909
 lindsay lohan 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.419
 not even 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.419
 to be studied and analyzed in the Senate 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.049
 and so 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.059
 should the soldier not resist 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.319
 but for him 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.769
 the river's producers 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.439
 attentive to the risk of rain at harvesting these damages to the 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.980
 I live sandra and mucuri are many 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.290
 the goal out 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.049
 the thrashing in recent years at European level 2012 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.069
 the rodeo 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.730
 for the goalkeeper that region as in other regions and until then 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.459
 the situation was the same 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.389
 it was very dry then I felt what it is that the producers leave while being a 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.799
 planting under these conditions 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.779
 unlike last year 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.849
 when the pre-planting application was practicing or good 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.009
 and allowed participation of sowing 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
 now in 2010 the picture is different 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.079
 according to itu it is very difficult to think of a planting with less than 100 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.999
 millimeters of rain 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.909
 that's what they talk about a lot of time 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.019
 the risk is too great for this data revealed yesterday 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.769
 in 2010 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.769
 same family 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.339
 in essence 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:10.999
 after the 11 years 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.479
 let's do it 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.549
 according to the company 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.099
 however the ecological footprint 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.180
 the defense so far 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.919
 climate change instability 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.919
 few producers have started the work 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.110
 during our visit to the area of ​​the rock and the three half 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.440
 they will have to plant soybeans in a new mutuma crop 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.319
 like this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.340
