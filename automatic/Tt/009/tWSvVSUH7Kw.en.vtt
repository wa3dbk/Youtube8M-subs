 For long overhang processing 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.800
 SilentTools damping posts minimize vibration 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.760
 CoroMill QD - no chip residue, high quality grooving solution 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.400
 In heavy load roughing 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 Predictable tool life 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360
 For production planning and 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.280
 Preventing tool breakage is critical 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.560
 CoroMill Plura Heavy Duty End Mill 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160
 Used to remove large amounts of metal in a short time 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.120
 At the same time ensure that the production process is safe and reliable 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.360
 Especially when dealing with demanding roughing 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.480
 With proven durability, CoroMill Plura is now 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 The first choice for roughing of the whole end mill 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.640
 The new heavy duty end mill is powerful during propulsion 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.760
 When using high cutting parameters 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.520
 It usually performs at its best 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.360
 This makes it a reliable chip remover! 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.440
 Imagine a drastic shortening of the delivery cycle 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320
 It takes only one week to complete a complete part 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120
 Even completed in two or three days 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.960
 From order to delivery 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 With the growing scarcity of technical expertise 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.600
 Get the latest solutions 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.440
 Critical to maintaining a leading position in the shift gear machining landscape 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.000
 Using InvoMilling 1.0 software 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880
 Is a smart move to shorten the gear production lead time 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760
 You can master the software in just a few hours 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.120
 Can be programmed later 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.120
 Adapt to the processing of different gears 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.960
 Eliminate the need for specific tools for each tooth profile 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 This shortens the part delivery cycle to just a few days
