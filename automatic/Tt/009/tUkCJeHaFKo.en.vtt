phone boosters this is their new 4G this
is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:20.189> simple<00:00:20.430> device<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.689> slide<00:00:21.930> your

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is a really simple device you slide your

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750 
is a really simple device you slide your

wired into your car you have an antenna
outside<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.900> car<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> gets<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.920> signal

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
outside the car and it gets you signal

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.009 
outside the car and it gets you signal
and<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.760> Universal<00:00:30.090> which<00:00:30.510> means<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> works

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and it's Universal which means it works

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.690 
and it's Universal which means it works
on<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.230> about<00:00:31.500> everything<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> has<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> cell

get except for Sprint's WiMAX
this<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.290> has<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.710> pretty

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this one actually has some pretty

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
this one actually has some pretty
profound<00:01:14.310> settings<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.150> adjustability<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
profound settings and adjustability so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300 
profound settings and adjustability so
that<00:01:16.049> lets<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.530> there's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> sprint<00:01:17.100> tower

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that lets say if there's a sprint tower

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.130 
that lets say if there's a sprint tower
across<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> street<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:18.780> try<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.960> blow

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
across the street you don't try to blow

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.420 
across the street you don't try to blow
the<00:01:19.259> Sprint<00:01:19.500> tower<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> water<00:01:20.189> or

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the Sprint tower out of the water or

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
the Sprint tower out of the water or
more<00:01:20.610> importantly<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.659> cool

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
more importantly it's really cool

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.880 
more importantly it's really cool
because<00:01:21.930> most<00:01:22.080> electronics<00:01:22.680> they're

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
because most electronics they're

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
because most electronics they're
professionals<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:23.670> engineers<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> they
