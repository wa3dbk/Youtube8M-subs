00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 hi there, you're on the blitz fan channel and with 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.160
 by you i am 701 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 and finally we got to the apogee 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.279
 Development of American medium tanks and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.010
 just before the tank m48 patton and let's 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.430
 let's see what we have been striving for so long 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.500
 First, let's talk about booking 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.960
 by far the most important part of medium 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 tanks strength of one thousand eight hundred 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 fifty units is not that strong 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.160
 a lot but not too little pretty 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 weighty figure for medium tank 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.540
 body reservation in the forehead 110 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.300
 millimeters aboard feed there everything is quite 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.160
 modestly booking towers 177 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 millimeters in the forehead board and feed 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.050
 again, we don't sound as strange as it seems 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.320
 it seemed but when booking a forehead in 110 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 millimeters we do not tank to the body 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 sorry 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.260
 because the tank is really huge tank 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 large and therefore targeting vulnerable 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.939
 the places are quite simply the only one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.500
 a way to catch bounce and not penetration 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.780
 stage and face is the most correct 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 a way to tank it on the club 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.630
 corps however the tower we have but on 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.360
 this time all the same big mask will not 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.700
 talk about the potanin but here and this mask 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 in principle, we can tank and also 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 we survived 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 not very bad angles vertical 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.229
 crosstalk but again the tower is not without us 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.420
 sin we have a huge turret 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.670
 the commander to target is very 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 just if you stand still therefore 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.259
 haul out because of any shelters 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.930
 possible but only with constant 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.939
 movement maneuverability maneuverability 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.360
 again mediocre in principle as on 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.270
 ninth pattani 47 tons mass 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.399
 pretty substantial amount and 810 horse 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 forces engine gives us approximately 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.960
 about 17 horsepower per tonne 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.920
 principle, not bad, we move 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 Much fresher than 9 patton but all 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.780
 Equally I would like to have fun 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.140
 so again a powerful explosion 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.360
 no it's not for us but what then for 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 us for us this damage smoothly 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.430
 go to the gun tools we have the same 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.069
 most yes too 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.239
 350 units of alpha but at the same time grew 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.430
 breaking through as many as 268 units and and as you know 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.950
 with c 10 level main shells 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.270
 are subcaliber what is their 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.510
 advantage you basically can 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.239
 read on the Internet but it is a significant plus 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.040
 the variation in 036 is quite solid 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.650
 advantage over previous 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.470
 subton mixing time 2 seconds to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.100
 the gun we have become much more accurate 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.700
 more precisely 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.470
 and we have grown tremendously 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.720
 gun stabilization in motion now with 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.019
 the guard can be handed out right and left 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.600
 and since we are the slegonets of those and the moves then this 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.580
 It turns out in two and not more so 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.100
 how to play on this tank itself 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.019
 all I read now is like 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.420
 hints that compared to the ninth 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.190
 podton tactics not much has changed 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.989
 again in the first half the battle and 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.840
 shoot off in the second half of the battle 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.239
 we rashim but in connection with 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 updated machine performance 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.340
 the range of our tasks has increased slightly 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.310
 and now we can act a little by 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.100
 another scenario and even aggressive play 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.079
 perhaps in solo perhaps the only one 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.959
 my opinion minus this tank will be 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.989
 that we have to pump out the guns 10 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.450
 the level it needs a minute 45 thousand 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.459
 experience this suggests that even 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.470
 we will have dozens a little bit 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.019
 suffer but it is a tool predtopovoe 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.150
 guns from the previous paton and she doesn't 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.510
 so bad and at the end of everything 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.640
 this apogee and our cycle want 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.440
 say that the branch is American 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.769
 I liked medium tanks 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.340
 almost all of this and m3 whether on the fourth 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.100
 level with a unique gameplay is a bunch 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.260
 ziv on the sixth which i think is one of 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.170
 most imba watts machines that level on 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.930
 seventh level t20 machine understand which 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.030
 not easy but if you can then you 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.459
 will open like no other 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.910
 Pershing in my opinion is generally one of 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.870
 the best of 108 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.840
 patan 46 paton 48 really 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.970
 unique and very good cars but for 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.340
 order to efficiently and most importantly 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.850
 of course it's fun to play them 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.330
 these hands will not be needed 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.330
 are simple 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.490
 and on this today everyone thanks for all 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.230
 attention if you liked the video not 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.300
 forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.940
 like and join a group 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.460
 VKontakte and of course if you missed 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.230
 previous issues required 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.300
 be sure to follow the link in 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.940
 description there you can read 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.560
 each machine of this branch in more detail 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.560
 to new meetings
