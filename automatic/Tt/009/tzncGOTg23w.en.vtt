mushrooms in case you didn't know that I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.929 
mushrooms in case you didn't know that I
want<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.769> talk<00:00:30.890> about<00:00:31.009> cleaning<00:00:31.279> them<00:00:31.550> because

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
want to talk about cleaning them because

want to talk about cleaning them because
we're<00:00:32.360> really<00:00:32.599> lucky<00:00:32.870> today<00:00:33.200> 21st<00:00:34.129> century

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
we're really lucky today 21st century

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.760 
we're really lucky today 21st century
mushrooms<00:00:34.910> don't<00:00:35.149> come<00:00:35.390> home<00:00:35.600> dirty<00:00:36.469> it's

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
mushrooms don't come home dirty it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.990 
mushrooms don't come home dirty it's
kind<00:00:36.950> of<00:00:37.010> like<00:00:37.160> buying<00:00:37.309> mussels<00:00:37.820> they're

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
kind of like buying mussels they're

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.779 
kind of like buying mussels they're
cultivated<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.020> they're<00:00:39.770> pretty<00:00:40.460> clean

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
cultivated so that they're pretty clean

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.510 
cultivated so that they're pretty clean
to<00:00:40.940> begin<00:00:41.210> with<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.350> don't<00:00:42.770> need<00:00:43.039> to<00:00:43.219> wash

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
to begin with so you don't need to wash

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.209 
to begin with so you don't need to wash
them<00:00:43.969> you<00:00:44.180> just<00:00:44.629> need<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:45.050> wipe<00:00:45.289> them<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.800> for

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
them you just need to wipe them and for

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.680 
them you just need to wipe them and for
very<00:00:46.399> good<00:00:46.579> reason<00:00:47.000> not<00:00:47.149> only<00:00:47.210> are<00:00:47.570> they

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
very good reason not only are they

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.970 
very good reason not only are they
cleaner<00:00:48.050> than<00:00:48.289> they<00:00:48.379> used<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.710> be<00:00:48.829> but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
cleaner than they used to be but

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.349 
cleaner than they used to be but
mushrooms<00:00:49.520> have<00:00:49.670> always<00:00:49.879> been<00:00:50.120> there<00:00:50.329> very

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
mushrooms have always been there very

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.040 
mushrooms have always been there very
absorptive<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:53.180> if<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:53.539> run<00:00:53.840> them<00:00:53.960> under

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
absorptive so you if you run them under

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.590 
absorptive so you if you run them under
water<00:00:54.379> they<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:55.070> absorbed<00:00:55.789> like<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.969> sponge<00:00:56.359> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
water they just absorbed like a sponge a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.990 
water they just absorbed like a sponge a
lot<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:57.109> of<00:00:57.739> liquid<00:00:58.250> which<00:00:58.460> means<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.789> have<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
lot of of liquid which means you have to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.729 
lot of of liquid which means you have to
cook<00:00:59.179> them<00:00:59.390> that<00:00:59.539> much<00:00:59.719> harder<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.410> order<00:01:00.620> to

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
cook them that much harder in order to

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.290 
cook them that much harder in order to
get<00:01:00.859> all<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.190> liquid<00:01:01.399> out<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.000> develop

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
get all that liquid out so you develop

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.840 
get all that liquid out so you develop
savory<00:01:03.019> flavor<00:01:03.620> which<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.129> what<00:01:04.280> happens<00:01:04.670> when

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
savory flavor which is what happens when

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.539 
savory flavor which is what happens when
they<00:01:04.939> caramelize<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.200> all<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.680> do<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.250> just

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
they caramelize so all you do is to just

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.480 
they caramelize so all you do is to just
wipe<00:01:08.330> them<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.080> what<00:01:09.890> happens<00:01:10.310> when

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
wipe them and you see what happens when

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.340 
wipe them and you see what happens when
I<00:01:10.520> wipe<00:01:10.790> my<00:01:10.820> mushrooms<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:11.780> start<00:01:12.200> to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
I wipe my mushrooms and they start to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.320 
I wipe my mushrooms and they start to
peel<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.650> little<00:01:12.890> bit<00:01:13.130> don't<00:01:13.640> be<00:01:13.820> afraid<00:01:14.150> of

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
peel a little bit don't be afraid of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.730 
peel a little bit don't be afraid of
that<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.540> know<00:01:14.780> some<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.080> my<00:01:15.140> students<00:01:15.500> will<00:01:15.590> say

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
that I know some of my students will say

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.569 
that I know some of my students will say
they<00:01:15.860> thought<00:01:16.040> they<00:01:16.159> were<00:01:16.280> doing<00:01:16.400> something

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579

wrong or that they were rubbing too hard
no<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.570> know<00:01:20.689> my<00:01:20.990> feeling<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:21.979> God<00:01:22.040> wanted

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
no you know my feeling is if God wanted

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.249 
no you know my feeling is if God wanted
that<00:01:22.670> skin<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.360> mushroom<00:01:23.720> he<00:01:23.930> wouldn't

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
that skin on the mushroom he wouldn't

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.050 
that skin on the mushroom he wouldn't
have<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.560> come<00:01:24.770> off<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.130> easy<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:25.610> I'm<00:01:25.759> doing

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060

have it come off so easy all I'm doing
is<00:01:26.119> wiping<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.600> with<00:01:26.630> paper<00:01:26.840> towels<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.290> if<00:01:27.860> it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
is wiping it with paper towels so if it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.289 
is wiping it with paper towels so if it
wants<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.610> come<00:01:28.880> off

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
this type of mushroom is you would just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.760 
this type of mushroom is you would just
trim<00:01:34.430> off<00:01:34.460> any<00:01:35.000> woody<00:01:35.420> bottom<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.470> stem

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
trim off any woody bottom of the stem

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.410 
trim off any woody bottom of the stem
and<00:01:37.479> slice<00:01:38.479> or<00:01:39.470> quarter<00:01:40.070> depending<00:01:40.729> on<00:01:41.210> what

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and slice or quarter depending on what

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.209 
and slice or quarter depending on what
you<00:01:41.630> want<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.930> do<00:01:42.079> I'm<00:01:42.619> actually<00:01:42.740> gonna<00:01:43.009> put

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
you want to do I'm actually gonna put

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.609 
you want to do I'm actually gonna put
some<00:01:43.450> glasses<00:01:44.450> on<00:01:44.719> so<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.049> can<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
some glasses on so that I can see the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.020 
some glasses on so that I can see the
world<00:01:45.969> more<00:01:46.969> clearly<00:01:47.770> okay

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
world more clearly okay

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.440 
world more clearly okay
