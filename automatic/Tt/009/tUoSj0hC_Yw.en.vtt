00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.440 
your guns well you just lose your teeth
and<00:03:28.750> that's<00:03:29.019> close<00:03:29.379> a<00:03:29.680> suggestion<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.790> topic

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
and that's close a suggestion of a topic

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.720 
and that's close a suggestion of a topic
I<00:03:31.569> should<00:03:31.750> talk<00:03:31.900> about<00:03:32.109> was<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.730> quantum

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
I should talk about was a quantum

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.670 
I should talk about was a quantum
physics<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.689> I<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:34.900> thinking<00:03:35.230> about<00:03:35.409> this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
physics and I was thinking about this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.190 
physics and I was thinking about this
you<00:03:36.129> know<00:03:36.250> being<00:03:36.549> me<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.389> lot<00:03:37.959> about

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
you know being me I know a lot about

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.770 
you know being me I know a lot about
quantum<00:03:38.829> physics<00:03:39.159> and<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.879> was<00:03:40.389> thinking

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
quantum physics and I was thinking

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.539 
quantum physics and I was thinking
should<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.079> talk<00:03:41.319> about<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.769> or<00:03:42.040> should<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.370> keep

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
should I talk about it or should I keep

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.030 
should I talk about it or should I keep
all<00:03:42.790> my<00:03:42.849> knowledge<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.629> myself<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.409> I<00:03:44.680> figured

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
all my knowledge to myself and I figured

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.009 
all my knowledge to myself and I figured
like<00:03:45.280> since<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.329> incredibly<00:03:46.989> much

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
like since I know so incredibly much

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.720 
like since I know so incredibly much
about<00:03:47.409> quantum<00:03:47.709> physics<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.159> should<00:03:48.639> probably

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
about quantum physics I should probably

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.199 
about quantum physics I should probably
just<00:03:49.090> keep<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.139> information<00:03:50.379> myself<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.310> know

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
just keep that information myself I know

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.679 
just keep that information myself I know
so<00:03:52.599> much<00:03:52.750> last<00:03:53.650> question<00:03:54.159> how<00:03:54.879> do<00:03:54.939> i<00:03:55.150> get<00:03:55.239> so

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
so much last question how do i get so

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.450 
so much last question how do i get so
fly<00:03:56.079> well<00:03:56.950> that's<00:03:57.129> neezy<00:03:57.400> questions<00:03:58.090> see<00:03:58.419> I
