00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120 
finally our third operating angle is
formed<00:04:46.390> by<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.510> driveshaft<00:04:46.870> slope<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.620> the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
formed by the driveshaft slope and the

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.700 
formed by the driveshaft slope and the
axle<00:04:48.460> slope<00:04:48.730> once<00:04:49.630> again<00:04:49.930> they<00:04:50.200> are<00:04:50.230> both<00:04:50.380> in

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
axle slope once again they are both in

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.280 
axle slope once again they are both in
the<00:04:50.770> same<00:04:50.950> direction<00:04:51.150> down<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.050> we<00:04:53.169> will

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
the same direction down so we will

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.920 
the same direction down so we will
subtract<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.340> lessor<00:04:54.700> from<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.480> grater<00:04:55.720> and

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
subtract the lessor from the grater and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.180 
subtract the lessor from the grater and
our<00:04:56.590> final<00:04:56.890> operating<00:04:57.400> angle<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.820> two<00:04:58.150> degrees

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
our final operating angle is two degrees

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.530 
our final operating angle is two degrees
no<00:05:00.190> matter<00:05:00.370> how<00:05:00.550> many<00:05:00.700> universal<00:05:01.210> joints<00:05:01.480> you

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
no matter how many universal joints you

no matter how many universal joints you

operating angles are calculated in the

operating angles are calculated in the

same manner just remember to add or

subtract slopes where they intersect to

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.060 
subtract slopes where they intersect to
