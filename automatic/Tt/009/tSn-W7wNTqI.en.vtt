00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490 

Marty<00:00:17.910> Piazza<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> surgical

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
Marty Piazza and we're in the surgical

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
Marty Piazza and we're in the surgical

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.680 

so<00:00:33.340> I'm<00:00:34.239> looking<00:00:35.110> kind<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.590> at<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.739> general

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so I'm looking kind of at a general

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.540 
so I'm looking kind of at a general
disease<00:00:37.690> process<00:00:38.110> that<00:00:38.320> occurs<00:00:38.590> in<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:39.370> lot<00:00:39.519> of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
disease process that occurs in a lot of

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.819 
disease process that occurs in a lot of
brain<00:00:39.820> tumors<00:00:40.000> i'm<00:00:40.870> looking<00:00:40.989> at<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.290> demo<00:00:41.680> which

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
brain tumors i'm looking at a demo which

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.619 
brain tumors i'm looking at a demo which
is<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:41.949> type<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.220> swelling<00:00:43.030> or<00:00:43.329> fluid

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
is a type of swelling or fluid

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.780 
is a type of swelling or fluid
collection<00:00:44.019> its<00:00:44.829> associated<00:00:45.309> with<00:00:45.460> tumors

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
collection its associated with tumors

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.899 
collection its associated with tumors
and<00:00:45.969> looking<00:00:46.300> for<00:00:46.930> ways<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.140> combat<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.040> it's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
and looking for ways to combat that it's

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.610 
and looking for ways to combat that it's
a<00:00:49.030> major<00:00:49.600> cause<00:00:49.839> of<00:00:49.870> morbidity<00:00:50.409> and<00:00:50.500> mortality

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
a major cause of morbidity and mortality

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.750 
a major cause of morbidity and mortality
and<00:00:51.339> brain<00:00:51.940> tumors<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:54.070> know<00:00:54.159> causes

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
and brain tumors because you know causes

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.040 
and brain tumors because you know causes
pressure<00:00:54.940> on<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> brain<00:00:55.420> since<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.839> brains

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
pressure on the brain since the brains

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.229 
pressure on the brain since the brains
in<00:00:56.199> an<00:00:56.320> enclosed<00:00:56.589> space<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:57.729> can<00:00:57.820> have<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> lot

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
in an enclosed space you can have a lot

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.630 
in an enclosed space you can have a lot
of<00:00:58.269> complications<00:00:58.899> with<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.620> so<00:00:59.800> it's<00:01:00.579> a

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
of complications with that and so it's a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.000 
of complications with that and so it's a
big<00:01:00.820> issue<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.960> be<00:01:02.079> addressed<00:01:02.110> especially

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
big issue to be addressed especially

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.740 
big issue to be addressed especially
since<00:01:03.370> bring<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:03.969> lot<00:01:04.179> of<00:01:04.210> brain<00:01:04.390> cancers

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
since bring a lot of brain cancers

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.900 
since bring a lot of brain cancers
aren't<00:01:05.500> curable<00:01:05.920> when<00:01:06.429> I<00:01:06.490> was<00:01:06.610> younger<00:01:06.789> I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
aren't curable when I was younger I

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.270 
aren't curable when I was younger I
moved<00:01:07.479> around<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.780> lot<00:01:07.810> my<00:01:08.470> dad<00:01:08.679> is<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:08.920> finance

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
moved around a lot my dad is in finance

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.279 
moved around a lot my dad is in finance
my<00:01:09.520> mom<00:01:09.670> was<00:01:09.820> an<00:01:09.940> english<00:01:10.090> teacher<00:01:10.390> around

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
my mom was an english teacher around

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.200 
my mom was an english teacher around
fourth<00:01:11.560> grade<00:01:11.800> i<00:01:11.830> moved<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.399> this<00:01:12.550> area<00:01:12.729> in<00:01:13.030> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
fourth grade i moved to this area in the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.020 
fourth grade i moved to this area in the
Washington<00:01:13.600> DC<00:01:13.630> area<00:01:13.929> and<00:01:14.410> spent<00:01:14.649> a<00:01:15.310> lot<00:01:15.910> of<00:01:15.940> a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
Washington DC area and spent a lot of a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.850 
Washington DC area and spent a lot of a
lot<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.450> time<00:01:16.660> kind<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.080> shadow<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.440> NIH

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
lot of time kind of in the shadow of NIH

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.380 
lot of time kind of in the shadow of NIH
but<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.160> never<00:01:18.310> really<00:01:18.610> got<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.820> chance<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.240> work

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
but I never really got a chance to work

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.690 
but I never really got a chance to work
here<00:01:19.720> until<00:01:20.500> now<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:22.830> went<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.920> college<00:01:24.550> at

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
here until now I went to college at

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.399 
here until now I went to college at
Princeton<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:25.360> studied<00:01:25.750> chemistry<00:01:26.020> there

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
Princeton and I studied chemistry there

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.020 
Princeton and I studied chemistry there
and<00:01:26.920> that's<00:01:27.039> kind<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.280> where<00:01:27.399> I<00:01:27.460> fell<00:01:27.909> in<00:01:28.000> love

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
and that's kind of where I fell in love

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.200 
and that's kind of where I fell in love
with<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.390> lab<00:01:28.539> environment<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:30.069> did<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.909> did

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
with the lab environment I did I did

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.029 
with the lab environment I did I did
solid-state<00:01:31.630> physical<00:01:32.319> chemistry<00:01:32.679> which<00:01:32.890> is

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
solid-state physical chemistry which is

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.440 
solid-state physical chemistry which is
very<00:01:33.310> different<00:01:33.550> from<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.970> type<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.149> research

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
very different from the type of research

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.160 
very different from the type of research
I'm<00:01:34.630> doing<00:01:34.659> now<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:36.220> just<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.780> kind<00:01:38.079> of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
I'm doing now but just that that kind of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.340 
I'm doing now but just that that kind of
mindset<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.680> you're<00:01:39.689> trying<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.869> find<00:01:41.259> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
mindset that you're trying to find a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.319 
mindset that you're trying to find a
question<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.890> answer<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.970> no<00:01:43.090> one<00:01:43.119> else

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
question and answer it that no one else

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.270 
question and answer it that no one else
knows<00:01:43.570> about<00:01:43.600> it's<00:01:43.990> really<00:01:44.409> exciting<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.950> be

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
knows about it's really exciting to be

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.690 
knows about it's really exciting to be
able<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.490> do<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.950> once<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.189> graduated<00:01:48.549> from

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
able to do that so once I graduated from

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.179 
able to do that so once I graduated from
Princeton<00:01:49.060> i<00:01:49.149> went<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.600> i<00:01:50.350> did<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> master's<00:01:51.159> in

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
Princeton i went to i did a master's in

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.719 
Princeton i went to i did a master's in
biophysics<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.909> physiology<00:01:52.540> at<00:01:52.780> georgetown

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
biophysics and physiology at georgetown

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.240 
biophysics and physiology at georgetown
just<00:01:54.729> up<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.969> road<00:01:55.090> from<00:01:55.149> here<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:57.130> know

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
just up the road from here and you know

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.670 
just up the road from here and you know
that<00:01:57.759> kind<00:01:57.939> of<00:01:57.969> solidified<00:01:58.540> my<00:01:58.810> desire<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.439> go

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
that kind of solidified my desire to go

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.520 
that kind of solidified my desire to go
into<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.979> medical<00:02:00.520> career<00:02:00.670> path<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.060> i<00:02:01.899> went<00:02:02.500> to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
into a medical career path and i went to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.649 
into a medical career path and i went to
medical<00:02:02.710> school<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:04.030> involved<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> lot<00:02:04.630> of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
medical school got involved in a lot of

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.389 
medical school got involved in a lot of
clinical<00:02:05.079> research<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:06.159> kind<00:02:06.340> of

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
clinical research but just kind of

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.859 
clinical research but just kind of
wanting<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.180> get<00:02:07.329> back<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.630> lab

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
wanting to get back to that lab

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.199 
wanting to get back to that lab
environment<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.850> that's<00:02:10.000> kind<00:02:10.179> of

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
environment and and so that's kind of

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.650 
environment and and so that's kind of
what<00:02:10.539> led<00:02:10.660> me<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.989> program<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.510> one<00:02:13.510> thing

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
what led me to this program so one thing

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.780 
what led me to this program so one thing
you<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:14.049> get<00:02:14.200> exposed<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.890> unless

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you don't really get exposed to unless

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.280 
you don't really get exposed to unless
you<00:02:15.970> kind<00:02:16.359> of<00:02:16.390> know<00:02:16.510> where<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.690> look<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.079> is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
you kind of know where to look for it is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.190 
you kind of know where to look for it is
is<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.829> ability<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.609> kind<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.690> answer

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
is this ability to kind of answer

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
is this ability to kind of answer
questions<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.709> no<00:02:20.829> one<00:02:20.980> knows<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> answer

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
questions that no one knows the answer

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690 
questions that no one knows the answer
and<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.040> that's<00:02:23.400> what's<00:02:23.580> really

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and so that's that's what's really

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.980 
and so that's that's what's really
exciting<00:02:23.820> about<00:02:24.120> medical<00:02:24.510> science<00:02:24.780> because

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
exciting about medical science because

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.750 
exciting about medical science because
it's<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.620> mean<00:02:25.920> there's<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.280> much<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.490> we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
it's not I mean there's so much that we

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's not I mean there's so much that we
don't<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.210> about<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.570> human<00:02:27.750> body<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
don't know about the human body and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.990 
don't know about the human body and
about<00:02:28.410> disease<00:02:28.710> processes<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.430> whatnot<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
about disease processes and whatnot and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.390 
about disease processes and whatnot and
so<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:31.170> only<00:02:31.320> way<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.530> learn<00:02:31.860> more<00:02:32.070> about<00:02:32.100> it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
so the only way to learn more about it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.310 
so the only way to learn more about it
is<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.700> participate<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> resources<00:02:34.080> going

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
is to participate in the resources going

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.870 
is to participate in the resources going
on<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:35.160> me<00:02:35.250> that's<00:02:35.460> what's<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> most

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
on for me that's what's the most

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.190 
on for me that's what's the most
exciting<00:02:36.150> part<00:02:36.450> about<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.870> no<00:02:36.990> one<00:02:37.020> else

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
exciting part about is that no one else

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.890 
exciting part about is that no one else
knows<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.740> what<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.040> doing<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.900> being

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
knows what I'm what I'm doing and being

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.050 
knows what I'm what I'm doing and being
able<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.890> only<00:02:40.920> execute<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.610> experiment

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
able to not only execute the experiment

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.490 
able to not only execute the experiment
to<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.270> able<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.480> talk<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.780> other<00:02:43.050> people<00:02:43.410> who

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
to be able to talk to other people who

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
to be able to talk to other people who
know<00:02:43.680> who<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.400> knowledgeable<00:02:44.610> about<00:02:45.000> these

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
know who are knowledgeable about these

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.090 
know who are knowledgeable about these
disease<00:02:45.750> processes<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.560> kind<00:02:47.010> of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
disease processes and kind of

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.620 
disease processes and kind of
collaborate<00:02:47.520> with<00:02:47.610> them<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.060> that's<00:02:48.480> really

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
collaborate with them and that's really

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780 
collaborate with them and that's really
exciting<00:02:48.960> for<00:02:49.140> me<00:02:49.290> most<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.310> work<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:50.640> is

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
exciting for me most of the work I do is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.180 
exciting for me most of the work I do is
looking<00:02:51.630> at<00:02:51.780> MRI<00:02:52.320> scans<00:02:52.650> which<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.920> what<00:02:53.070> we

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
looking at MRI scans which is what we

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.350 
looking at MRI scans which is what we
what<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:54.650> used<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.740> look<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.160> brain<00:02:56.880> problems

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
what we used to look at brain problems

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.440 
what we used to look at brain problems
and<00:02:58.050> brain<00:02:58.770> disease<00:02:59.040> processes<00:02:59.490> and<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.300> also

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
and brain disease processes and I also

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.290 
and brain disease processes and I also
do<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> lot<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.440> tissue<00:03:01.740> preparation<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
do a lot of tissue preparation and and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.610 
do a lot of tissue preparation and and
staining<00:03:06.300> for<00:03:06.660> different<00:03:07.200> different

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
staining for different different

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.350 
staining for different different
proteins<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.250> see<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.490> brain<00:03:08.760> tissue<00:03:09.000> on

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
proteins that we see in brain tissue on

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.160 
proteins that we see in brain tissue on
the<00:03:09.780> microscope<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.280> also<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:12.209> know<00:03:12.240> along

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the microscope and I also you know along

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.870 
the microscope and I also you know along
with<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.530> goes<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> lot<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.310> pipetting<00:03:14.730> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
with that goes a lot of pipetting and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.360 
with that goes a lot of pipetting and
stuff<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:16.050> it's<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.220> get

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
stuff like that so it's it's it's I get

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.350 
stuff like that so it's it's it's I get
to<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.550> lot<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.790> different<00:03:17.880> things<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
to do a lot of different things and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.490 
to do a lot of different things and
we're<00:03:18.480> allowed<00:03:18.630> from<00:03:18.870> hats<00:03:19.050> which<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.320> really

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
we're allowed from hats which is really

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.780 
we're allowed from hats which is really
exciting<00:03:21.800> someone<00:03:22.800> explain<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.190> explains

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
exciting someone explain it explains

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.310 
exciting someone explain it explains
this<00:03:23.940> meat<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.420> me<00:03:24.540> when<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.810> first<00:03:25.080> got<00:03:25.260> here

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
this meat to me when I first got here

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.170 
this meat to me when I first got here
and<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.010> very<00:03:26.130> true<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
and I think it's very true is that you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.060 
and I think it's very true is that you
know<00:03:27.300> medicine<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.050> all<00:03:28.230> about<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.890> know<00:03:28.920> you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
know medicine is all about you know you

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.259 
know medicine is all about you know you
have<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> disease<00:03:29.459> process<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.180> how

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
have a disease process and this is how

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.820 
have a disease process and this is how
you<00:03:30.300> fix<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.080> what<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> known<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.769> is

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
you fix it this is what is known this is

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.880 
you fix it this is what is known this is
this<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.280> how<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.720> whereas<00:03:33.890> research

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
this is how you do it whereas research

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.740 
this is how you do it whereas research
is<00:03:35.100> very<00:03:35.160> different<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.660> how

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
is very different it's this is how

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.509 
is very different it's this is how
people<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.500> what<00:03:37.590> people<00:03:37.800> think<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.370> want

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
people this is what people think we want

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.250 
people this is what people think we want
to<00:03:38.610> disprove<00:03:39.120> them<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.570> figure<00:03:39.840> out<00:03:39.900> another

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
to disprove them and figure out another

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
to disprove them and figure out another
way<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> another<00:03:41.310> way<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> fix<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.820> problem

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
way to another way to fix the problem

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.270 
way to another way to fix the problem
better<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.140> kind<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:43.739> that's

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
better and so that's kind of what that's

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.520 
better and so that's kind of what that's
not<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> mindset<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.480> I'm<00:03:45.690> used<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.170> you<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
not a mindset that I'm used to you and

had gotten more involved in research and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.530 
had gotten more involved in research and
there's<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.560> lot<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.709> opportunities<00:04:14.220> at<00:04:14.280> NIH<00:04:14.610> to
