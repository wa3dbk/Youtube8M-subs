it's<00:03:00.300> upside<00:03:00.840> down<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.530> that's<00:03:01.950> because

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
it's upside down here that's because

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.090 
it's upside down here that's because
they<00:03:02.430> use<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:03.000> large<00:03:03.600> piece<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.830> see

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
they use one large piece as you can see

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.640 
they use one large piece as you can see
it<00:03:05.790> goes<00:03:06.000> great<00:03:06.390> once<00:03:06.720> again<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.260> goes<00:03:07.380> all<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
it goes great once again it goes all the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.230 
it goes great once again it goes all the
way<00:03:07.800> around<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.650> they<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.830> use<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.310> piece<00:03:11.700> of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
way around so they just use one piece of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:20.330 
way around so they just use one piece of
the<00:03:13.020> Tommy<00:03:13.620> air<00:03:15.470> cat<00:03:16.470> canvas<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.220> gonna

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
the Tommy air cat canvas so it's gonna

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.949 
the Tommy air cat canvas so it's gonna
be<00:03:20.610> right<00:03:20.940> side<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.570> side<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.840> then

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
be right side up on the side and then

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.170 
be right side up on the side and then
backward<00:03:22.830> or<00:03:23.100> upside<00:03:23.370> down<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> other

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
backward or upside down on the other

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.600 
backward or upside down on the other
side<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.830> mean<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:28.019> might<00:03:28.260> be<00:03:28.530> true<00:03:29.489> with

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
side so I mean that might be true with

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.050 
side so I mean that might be true with
the<00:03:29.730> real<00:03:29.940> ones<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.330> probably<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.760> but<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.970> have
