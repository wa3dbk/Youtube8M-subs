00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.180
 man is constantly in different 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.170
 mental states which 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 match 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.390
 current solvable problems and their ability 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.280
 control ie skill on time 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.860
 go out and go out of them and have 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:57.450
 the main skill that leads to success and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.630
 good health now I'm 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.309
 I will offer you a simple way which 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.729
 help you quickly switch from one 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.520
 mental state to another for 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.729
 start remember 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.539
 algorithm of any actions that immediately 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.550
 you are concentrated and brought to the desired 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.130
 fret 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.050
 first you must draw 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.050
 second attention 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.500
 laconically formulate the necessary 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.369
 there is a wishful expression 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:43.490
 verbal noun + verb 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:48.050
 + adjective and nothing extra 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 third create a mental image 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:57.990
 necessary in my head as it were 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 dream and collect the real picture in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.959
 consciousness using your imagination like 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.930
 not strange but all you need is 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:15.120
 hereinafter this is a piece of paper and a pen 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 it turns out that when we take the paper and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 pen we get our attention when 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.300
 we write the necessary without parasitic words 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.280
 formulating the task concisely then we 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.780
 we build the best hierarchy in 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 subconscious when we are figuratively 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.320
 present the need and we go out to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 creative process of creation in which 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.960
 formed the best 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 comfortable and mental state 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.080
 which contributes to the rapid achievement 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.480
 of success 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:03.840
 for example, you need to calm down 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:07.060
 then you write the phrase i calm down quickly 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.950
 in the process of writing the text 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.590
 need to speak out loud 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.950
 to use sound 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.570
 component 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.240
 a situation when you do not have at hand is not 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.370
 pens are not a piece of paper you will be 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.270
 enough to write this phrase 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.540
 finger on the table on the legs on the wall and even 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.780
 just in the air while figuratively 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.290
 imagining that you are writing real 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.540
 letters then you need to remember 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.400
 presenting something good from the past 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.200
 yourself figuratively in that situation when you 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.959
 were calm and good atmosphere 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:56.380
 and all further happens unnoticed for 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.500
 you need to switch after which 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.040
 sure to fix arising 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.420
 state by further immersion 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.600
 good memories watching your favorite 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.330
 books pictures 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.190
 watching a video listening to a song and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.609
 so on with time you can afford 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.669
 pick up any situations 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.840
