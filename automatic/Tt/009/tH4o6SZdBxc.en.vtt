00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
mandrel sizes this one here would be

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330 
mandrel sizes this one here would be
generated<00:00:39.239> by<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> smallest<00:00:40.050> which<00:00:40.950> happens

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
generated by the smallest which happens

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.790 
generated by the smallest which happens
to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> longest<00:00:41.850> mandrel<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
about 15 16 17 millimeters depending on

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
about 15 16 17 millimeters depending on
how<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:55.020> wire<00:00:55.230> responds<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> shaping

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
how your wire responds to the shaping

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.979 
how your wire responds to the shaping
I'm<00:00:57.890> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> work<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.000> mid<00:01:00.300> size<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I'm going to work with the mid size of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.250 
I'm going to work with the mid size of
the<00:01:01.590> cones<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> shape<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the cones and you can see the shape is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.130 
the cones and you can see the shape is
different<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.220> cone<00:01:05.549> shape<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.540> point<00:01:06.900> is

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
different the cone shape the point is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.700 
different the cone shape the point is
inverted<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> what<00:01:08.670> occurs<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
inverted and what occurs there is it is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820 
inverted and what occurs there is it is
the<00:01:11.189> same<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> winding<00:01:12.240> process<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.590> as

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the same kind of winding process but as

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.060 
the same kind of winding process but as
you<00:01:14.250> begin<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.150> cranking<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.670> find

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
you begin your cranking you will find

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.980 
you begin your cranking you will find
that<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.880> no<00:01:20.970> gapping<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> occurs<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
that there is no gapping that occurs and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
that there is no gapping that occurs and
what<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> also<00:01:26.640> add<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.950> coil<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
what I can do is also add a coil to it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.399 
what I can do is also add a coil to it
to<00:01:30.180> continue<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> cranking<00:01:33.110> there's<00:01:34.110> no

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to continue the cranking there's no

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.350 
to continue the cranking there's no
pressure<00:01:35.119> there's<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.329> tension<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
pressure there's no tension just a

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.289 
pressure there's no tension just a
gentle<00:01:39.360> hold<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.350> tool<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> wire

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
gentle hold on the tool and on the wire

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.149 
gentle hold on the tool and on the wire
at<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.560> formed<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> cone

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
at is as it is formed on to the cone

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.210 
at is as it is formed on to the cone
I'll<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.520> continue<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.770> now<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> core

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I'll just continue this way now the core

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.880 
I'll just continue this way now the core
wire<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:51.060> 18<00:01:51.450> gauge<00:01:51.689> artistic<00:01:52.320> wire<00:01:52.560> in

artistic<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> finish<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.969> with

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
artistic and then I finish it up with

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.479 
artistic and then I finish it up with
the<00:02:04.229> coil<00:02:04.560> color<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.000> core<00:02:06.299> wire<00:02:07.489> I'll

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the coil color of the core wire I'll

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.790 
the coil color of the core wire I'll
show<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> how<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> remove<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
show you how I remove it with the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.300 
show you how I remove it with the
traditional<00:02:11.400> cone<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.150> just

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
traditional cone you just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.949 
traditional cone you just
from<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> guide<00:02:13.880> hole<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.900> see

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
from the guide hole but as you can see

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.920 
from the guide hole but as you can see
the<00:02:15.440> tip<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:15.950> at<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> base<00:02:16.459> here<00:02:16.760> now<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.750> I'll

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
the tip is at the base here now so I'll

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.520 
the tip is at the base here now so I'll
need<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.170> remove<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.890> first

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
need to remove it first

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.339 
need to remove it first
cut<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.680> away<00:02:22.360> remove<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> crank

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
cut it away remove it with the crank

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.589 
cut it away remove it with the crank
that<00:02:24.560> comes<00:02:24.800> with<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.250> cone<00:02:25.849> tastic<00:02:26.300> tool<00:02:26.680> and

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
that comes with the cone tastic tool and

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.780 
that comes with the cone tastic tool and
then<00:02:29.599> I'm<00:02:29.750> able<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.380> remove<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.160> let<00:02:31.700> me

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
then I'm able to remove it from let me

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.350 
then I'm able to remove it from let me
just<00:02:31.970> cut<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> little<00:02:32.239> bit<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.810> wire<00:02:33.019> way

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
just cut a little bit of the wire way

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.490 
just cut a little bit of the wire way
that's<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> wire<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:35.989> sitting<00:02:36.319> in<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
that's the wire that's sitting in the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.660 
that's the wire that's sitting in the
guide<00:02:36.709> hole<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.900> then<00:02:38.900> gently<00:02:39.680> remove<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
guide hole and then gently remove the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.220 
guide hole and then gently remove the
mandrel<00:02:41.980> from<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.160> cone<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.810> much

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
mandrel from the cone this is much

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.160 
mandrel from the cone this is much
larger<00:02:45.739> than<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.250> traditional<00:02:46.760> sizes<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.420> it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
larger than the traditional sizes and it

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
larger than the traditional sizes and it
really<00:02:48.560> does<00:02:48.799> hold<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.220> very<00:02:49.549> well<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:50.120> a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
really does hold up very well with a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.400 
really does hold up very well with a
large<00:02:51.410> gauge<00:02:51.739> wires<00:02:52.730> thick<00:02:53.269> wires<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.900> have

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
large gauge wires thick wires I have

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.710 
large gauge wires thick wires I have
some<00:02:54.590> samples<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.580> one<00:02:55.819> here<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.299> a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
some samples here this one here is a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.930 
some samples here this one here is a
twisted<00:02:57.350> wire<00:02:57.500> double<00:02:57.950> twisted<00:02:58.400> twist<00:02:58.670> wire

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
twisted wire double twisted twist wire

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.420 
twisted wire double twisted twist wire
and<00:02:59.239> that<00:03:00.080> was<00:03:00.260> formed<00:03:00.680> on<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.220> these

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
and that was formed on one of these

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.880 
and that was formed on one of these
manuals<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.150> believe<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.810> was<00:03:02.900> formed<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
manuals I believe it was formed on the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.589 
manuals I believe it was formed on the
thinnest<00:03:04.760> mandrel<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.880> one<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.330> the

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
thinnest mandrel and this one is the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.870 
thinnest mandrel and this one is the
rose<00:03:08.780> gold<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.950> will<00:03:10.160> probably<00:03:10.370> was

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
rose gold and this will probably was

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
rose gold and this will probably was
formed<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.319> largest<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.580> manuals<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
formed on the largest of the manuals the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
formed on the largest of the manuals the
inverted<00:03:16.519> mandrels<00:03:16.910> really<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> nice<00:03:17.570> job

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
inverted mandrels really do a nice job

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.670 
inverted mandrels really do a nice job
of<00:03:18.200> creating<00:03:18.970> beautifully<00:03:20.109> designed<00:03:21.109> cones

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
of creating beautifully designed cones

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.550 
of creating beautifully designed cones
with<00:03:22.430> different<00:03:22.910> types<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.359> wire<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.930> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
with different types of wire and the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.770 
with different types of wire and the
beauty<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.850> feature<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
beauty of it is and the feature is that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.110 
beauty of it is and the feature is that
you<00:03:26.840> can<00:03:26.989> have<00:03:27.260> wider<00:03:27.560> diameters<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.910> have

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
you can have wider diameters you have

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.440 
you can have wider diameters you have
longer<00:03:29.840> lengths<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:31.400> an<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:32.000> might<00:03:32.269> even

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
longer lengths and it's an it might even

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.319 
longer lengths and it's an it might even
be<00:03:32.630> an<00:03:32.720> easier<00:03:33.049> process<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:34.400> winding<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.180> wire

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
be an easier process of winding the wire

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.840 
be an easier process of winding the wire
on<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> mandrel<00:03:36.140> thank<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.190> for<00:03:37.370> being<00:03:37.519> here
