00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
when it opened up I was excited and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.580 
when it opened up I was excited and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
determined and it worked out

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.589 
determined and it worked out
we<00:02:10.830> talked<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.489> character<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.970> lot<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> go

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
we talked about character a lot I go

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.809 
we talked about character a lot I go
back<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:13.019> character<00:02:13.440> all<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.800> time<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
back to character all the time and I

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
back to character all the time and I
think<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.750> me<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.739> belief<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> few<00:02:17.610> doing

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
think for me my belief is a few doing

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.910 
think for me my belief is a few doing
the<00:02:17.910> right<00:02:18.030> things<00:02:18.269> at<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.450> core<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the right things at the core then the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.130 
the right things at the core then the
result<00:02:20.250> will<00:02:20.489> usually<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.660> we

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
result will usually be what you want we

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.660 
result will usually be what you want we
take<00:02:22.319> care<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> day-to-day<00:02:22.980> stuff<00:02:23.459> I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
take care of the day-to-day stuff I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.369 
take care of the day-to-day stuff I
think<00:02:23.849> it's<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.239> important<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> practice

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
think it's really important to practice

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.140 
think it's really important to practice
and<00:02:25.590> prepare<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:26.069> competition<00:02:26.250> at<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:26.819> times

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we try to stay focused on the process

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.570 
we try to stay focused on the process
with<00:02:30.900> at<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> same<00:02:31.620> time<00:02:31.830> having<00:02:32.040> an<00:02:32.190> outcome

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
with at the same time having an outcome

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.610 
with at the same time having an outcome
goal<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.970> really<00:02:33.209> excites<00:02:33.660> us<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.140> don't

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
goal that really excites us I I don't

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.140 
goal that really excites us I I don't
necessarily<00:02:34.799> think<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.549> outcome<00:02:35.940> goal

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
necessarily think the outcome goal

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
necessarily think the outcome goal
always<00:02:36.569> has<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.900> be<00:02:37.019> something<00:02:37.470> that's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
always has to be something that's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.530 
always has to be something that's
completely<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.060> reach<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.510> think

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
completely out of your reach I think

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.229 
completely out of your reach I think
sometimes<00:02:40.170> when<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.590> feels<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.239> much

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
sometimes when it feels like it's much

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.479 
sometimes when it feels like it's much
closer<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:42.810> easier<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.290> work<00:02:43.470> hard<00:02:44.130> each<00:02:44.370> and

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
closer it's easier to work hard each and

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.800 
closer it's easier to work hard each and
every<00:02:44.730> day<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.299> at<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> end<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
every day and then at the end of the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.030 
every day and then at the end of the
season<00:02:46.110> when<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:46.829> you're

season when you look back I think you're

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400

making that move and Stanford was one of

whole<00:04:49.560> lot<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.830> Skip<00:04:50.340> was<00:04:50.849> great<00:04:51.240> at<00:04:51.449> and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
whole lot that Skip was great at and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.170 
whole lot that Skip was great at and
first<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.009> foremost<00:04:53.370> was<00:04:53.610> creating<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.000> team

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
first and foremost was creating a team

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.719 
first and foremost was creating a team
environment<00:04:54.479> to<00:04:55.440> build<00:04:55.590> team<00:04:55.919> chemistry<00:04:56.159> the

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
environment to build team chemistry the

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.450 
environment to build team chemistry the
team<00:04:57.090> bonding<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:58.139> buy<00:04:58.319> into<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.680> team<00:04:58.919> values

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
team bonding to buy into the team values

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.999 
team bonding to buy into the team values
is<00:04:59.699> by<00:05:00.180> far<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:01.229> most<00:05:01.379> important<00:05:01.889> thing<00:05:01.979> that

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
is by far the most important thing that

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.379 
is by far the most important thing that
skip<00:05:02.310> stressed<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.789> I<00:05:02.879> plan<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.240> carry

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
skip stressed and I plan to carry

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.909 
skip stressed and I plan to carry
forward<00:05:03.719> although<00:05:04.349> it's<00:05:04.500> more<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:04.889> less

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
forward although it's more or less

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.980 
forward although it's more or less
considered<00:05:05.340> an<00:05:05.490> individual<00:05:06.030> sport<00:05:06.389> it's<00:05:06.870> a

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
considered an individual sport it's a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.170 
considered an individual sport it's a
team<00:05:07.199> championship<00:05:07.889> I'd<00:05:08.520> say<00:05:08.759> in<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
team championship I'd say in the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.869

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
contributions this year coaching really

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.360 
contributions this year coaching really
is<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.279> 24-hour<00:05:35.880> job<00:05:36.110> it's<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:38.159> type<00:05:38.340> of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
is a 24-hour job it's not the type of

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.459 
is a 24-hour job it's not the type of
thing<00:05:38.639> you<00:05:38.759> can<00:05:38.909> turn<00:05:39.090> it<00:05:39.210> off<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.229> guess

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
thing you can turn it off and I guess

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.110 
thing you can turn it off and I guess
I've<00:05:40.740> just<00:05:40.770> been<00:05:41.099> doing<00:05:41.279> it<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:41.639> long<00:05:41.669> it's

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
I've just been doing it so long it's

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.600 
I've just been doing it so long it's
become<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.509> part<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.080> me<00:05:43.199> my<00:05:43.380> wife<00:05:43.979> understands

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
become a part of me my wife understands

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.999 
become a part of me my wife understands
it<00:05:44.819> my<00:05:44.940> kids<00:05:45.000> understand<00:05:45.750> it<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.199> I<00:05:46.620> love<00:05:46.860> it

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
it my kids understand it and I love it

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.879 
it my kids understand it and I love it
so<00:05:47.190> it's<00:05:47.969> very<00:05:48.150> easy<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.690> handle<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:51.889> year

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
so it's very easy to handle the the year

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.709 
so it's very easy to handle the the year
roundness<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.669> it<00:05:53.789> because<00:05:54.090> it<00:05:54.389> really<00:05:54.569> is

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
roundness of it because it really is

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.450 
roundness of it because it really is
full<00:05:55.020> full<00:05:55.409> year<00:05:55.620> whether<00:05:55.889> it's<00:05:56.069> collegiate
