00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.980
 hello how are we already here back and 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.770
 today we are going to make a delicious 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.750
 carrot jam with lemon so 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.900
 nothing because this recipe is dedicated to 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.150
 Carrot lovers ingredients 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.660
 that we are going to need is a kilo of 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.570
 carrots the original recipe tells us 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.900
 than a kilo of sugar but good 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.020
 it seemed exaggerated and I've put 400 that 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.110
 it's enough, we're going to need 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.309
 4 lemons from which I have taken the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.410
 juice of 3 and here is the skin of one of 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.739
 them and as I always say only the part 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.519
 yellow and here I have prepared two 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.199
 each one has half a liter of water 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.690
 then what are we going to start doing 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.180
 is 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.190
 let's put the carrot in the middle 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.920
 liter of water and let's let it 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.880
 cook slowly once you have 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.479
 we're going to drain it well and what 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.710
 let's beat and in the other case we're going to 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.710
 put the water with the sugar and already when 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.130
 it's a little hot we'll add the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.080
 juice of the three lemons and the skin of the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.909
 Lemon, then, well, I'm going to 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.909
 put to it and now see you 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.909
 You can be good and good is 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.950
 jam because in the end the carrot 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.270
 will sing Canary as a water with the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.159
 sugar have been like more than an hour 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.570
 baking carrots good yes it is 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.659
 true that I had to add water with 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.140
 other times because it evaporates 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.720
 so then I have already cast it 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.509
 excluded well and that of shake with the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.450
 blender I have not left one then finally 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.289
 or more has been good and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.960
 water with sugar and lemon 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.590
 they have also been made as a does not reach 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 be candy 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.840
 but good welcomed as well as a little 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.960
 of the candy color and what I'm going to 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 to do is little by little 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.110
 I'm going to add it once I 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.110
 we have added let's wait for a 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 little bit to cool and then we can 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.470
 put in the cans and put in the fridge 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.120
 and well, this delicious jam of 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.120
 carrot with a touch of lemon 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.780
 and nothing then for great breakfast with 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.670
 cheese to accompany exquisite meats 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 so nothing I will tell you about such 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.489
 way the result would burn 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.140
 some some ingredient and nothing then that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.240
 enjoy it here for 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.530
 for those who love carrot good 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.530
 well until another day until then
