she's going to with this song but I just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
she's going to with this song but I just
won't<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.979> my<00:01:11.100> opinion<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.610> may<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
won't it's just my opinion I may be

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
won't it's just my opinion I may be
wrong<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.420> may<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.260> may<00:01:13.439> agree<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
wrong I may be right you may agree you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
wrong I may be right you may agree you
may<00:01:14.070> disagree<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.540> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
may disagree but this is just what I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.679 
may disagree but this is just what I
think<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.979> think<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.060> she

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
think about it because I think that she

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
think about it because I think that she
has<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.740> potential<00:01:20.130> than<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.580> she's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
has more potential than what she's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.950 
has more potential than what she's
giving<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:23.310> however<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:24.570> the
