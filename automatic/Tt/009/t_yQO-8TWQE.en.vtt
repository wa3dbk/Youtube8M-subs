00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.130
 welcome to a face episode of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.429
 sniper your fault list I see myself while 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.099
 that's good because I've seen the previous one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 episode and neither coÃ±a the current end of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.990
 with the direct one I thought yes but no 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.970
 it's pretty slow but good 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.529
 let's see if it depends on how is this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.630
 departure because the previous one as was 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.340
 luque town I made two episodes because 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 I said that the court does not know that it depends on 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 how is it being split so we will play a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 or two depends also what we have more 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.150
 If we kill a little bit, I commit myself to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 play another game yes 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.290

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 concentration of campero 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.220
 the penalty behind 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.010
 around here do not fail me or it's okay 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.480
 I could know 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 here is making one 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.130
 affirm that there is in the comet good 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.750
 with me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.280
 how to make a pineapple as well as the one that does not 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.270
 he wants the rib 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 having all 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.860
 could have been that perfectly 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.690
 collateral but we already know that the white 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.540

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.780
 why 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.190
 that's why I see with the back where 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.780
 there is not, but we go zoom 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.619

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.170
 dead the marker 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.310
 died dead or if it had been on average 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.310
 markt or would have been single 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990
 but 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.170
