00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.370
 very soon what global insight is all about 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.740
 Welcome to Saturday morning in the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.930
 bathrobe is as a super woman two 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 minutes I just stood've 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.849
 only completely mussed I looked 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 what did you manage the most? 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.340
 comment and came out is which 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 champion deserves my earliest 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.020
 opinion down what two 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.910
 champions, moreover, spokesmen, as it were 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.860
 and i just start the stopwatch 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.960
 and first of all for me 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 champions who deserve to be 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.790
 champion stands so often to be played 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.290
 It's very hard for them to do it very hard 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.730
 to play because they are obviously one 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.950
 are a bit too strong 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.070
 I think at the moment it's all very 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.440
 coffins balanced so there are actually 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.560
 not really the right champions 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 evil op are but if you him 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.420
 I would have to decide 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 Leblond earns a small one quite 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.740
 very light maybe a bit 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.020
 less level 2 level 3 burst so 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
 a little less earlybird and otherwise 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.439
 but I think from level 6 and so on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.479
 if you can play them well you should 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.479
 yes you will be rewarded that one that one 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.189
 with her really nice someone off away 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 shreds and then jumps away again 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 for example, even this mechanics 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.810
 mastered that is the should also yes 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 be rewarded for it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 but I think he is really real 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.840
 strong and maybe you can do it all 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.850
 easily annoying 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 but that is so minimal I think 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 now cupped apple should have thought 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.659
 become 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.389
 I think that's a bit like that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.219
 interesting there were champions and 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.590
 there's surprised me riha deals 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.389
 with champions that are always played 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 ranga virtual world is now called 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.099
 again ran op is with the Koreans 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.459
 again banned all the time 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.049
 I do not understand it but it does not matter if so 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.369
 maybe it has to be done longer 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.619
 maybe that was the champion though 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.319
 brought in all honesty I would look 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.240
 wish that viktor viktor me 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.250
 she never really 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.500
 the ones besides the games themselves or 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.770
 mike a team was taken recently but 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.170
 victor his mechanics were a long time 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.020
 Packed lightly took a long time 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.450
 until he changed that over then 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.490
 then I think so I find him 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 okay , but I do not know 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.550
 what is it write should you please 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.130
 in the comments why is there so 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.720
 but little is played but something must 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.950
 not vote for this champion and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 afford bach definitely deserves that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.990
 yes that was already two minutes so 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.540
 le blond or maybe in the future 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.520
 rennkart in so at the very top 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.220
 the list for the works and otherwise 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.910
 Viktor please a little Bach message 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.740
 Ambri has what we as me I'm 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.600
 early riser dressing gown hair 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.780
 mussed until next time people 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.780
 Yes
