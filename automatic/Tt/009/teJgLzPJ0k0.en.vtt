00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello main lesson topic 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 circle filling algorithms 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 prepare everything you need 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.650
 today we will fill the circles 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.529
 them which intersect on the face 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.879
 the side and the length of which depends 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 drawing we know how to embroider a circle 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.980
 where the line connects the neighboring point then 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.379
 it turns out filling along the contour with 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.570
 broken line or solid line 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.150
 algorithm is a repetitive action 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.520
 you can apply this basic algorithm 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.860
 on a circle with any number of points 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.660
 to explain the basic algorithm we 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.160
 take the circle divided into 12 points 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.970
 circle allows above 3 new 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.200
 when between points 1 and 2 you can 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.250
 skip one point 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.480
 two points 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.200
 3. 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.230
 clean points 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.780
 five points 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.500
 main algorithm for filling the circle 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.400
 steps forward line down clockwise 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.140
 arrow step small forward adjacent 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.070
 point on the wrong side 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.970
 length step back 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.820
 line up counterclockwise step 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.570
 little forward the next point on 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.570
 seamy side 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 sharden and forward line down clockwise 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.369
 arrow step small forward adjacent 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.369
 point on the wrong side 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 length step back line up versus 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 clock hand 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 step small forward adjacent point on 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.270
 seamy side 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 and 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.540
 solid line on seamy side 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.860
 the circle allows you to embroider lines where 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.280
 between points 1 and 2, you can skip two 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.280
 points 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.200
 on the wrong side of the broken line 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.880
 superimposed on each other stitches 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.420
 now we embroider a line when between 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.420
 points 1 and 2 you can skip three points 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.830
 and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.070
 got a filling circle 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.400
 the stars on the seamy side are solid 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.400
 line 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.430
 between points 1 and 2 you can skip 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.430
 four points 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.530
 on the wrong side if not accustomed the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.530
 superimposed on each other stitches 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:12.270
 fill the line circumference when between 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.270
 points 1 and 2 5 points 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.960
 on the wrong side of the dashed line 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.750
 knot and request nasty beautiful pattern 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.810
 It turns out if all five are embroidered 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.910
 circles on one circle 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.060
 we embroider circles with overlapping each 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.900
 friend's first higher circle through 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.900
 five points 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.080
 old circle after 4 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.930
 next three points 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.820
 now and sew through two points 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:46.379
 and end in one circle. 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.790
 the pattern is ready for new meetings
