00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 ancient and very well known there in 1989 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.380

 process demonstrated the whole universe 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.480
 interesting that will be known by 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.349
 futuristic as good story summing up 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.700
 open book of rpg released in 1989 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 based on many works of fiction 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 science of the 80's 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 especially in the classic neuromancer 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.520
 even used as inspiration 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.760
 for the movie matrix ness and like matrix 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 huh 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 so our tip for you is also 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 this book does not have a neuromancer name 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 You guys are going to enjoy it. It's cool to see where. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.530
 many ideas from the movie were taken but 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 Now let's continue here by telling a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.520
 little sheldon to you 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 the futuristic story but in a world 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.290
 alternative to the city developed 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.420
 to the extreme while the streets are 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.909
 dominated by punk hackers equipped with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 equipment advance said mus de 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.240
 biotechnology the offices fuel 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 of ghost employees who work 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 to strengthen the mega's role 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.900
 corporation that today has the control of 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 everyone by dangerous universe 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.680
 each corner hides a mystery to be 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.630
 investigated, it is possible to improve 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 intelligence with memories with a chip 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 implanted your brain and also running 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.920
 much faster with bionic implants 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 legs and does not stop there where a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.520
 maggi way found a space of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.950
 around the limits of the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 possible and impossible to confuse if both 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.479
 with advanced technology as well as with 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.520
 people with power to control magic 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.009
 with so many possibilities of powers 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.219
 weapons character adventures possible 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.439
 it is clear that since 1989 someone thought of 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.149
 turn this into a video game and look 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.020
 which did not take long and not four years 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.720
 then in 1990 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.090
 I left the first attempt to ramp shadow 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.910
 super clean this version presented the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 isometric rpg those with top view 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.730
 knows then graphics and 31 somber hours 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.740
 helped to form an adult environment and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.990
 heavy with a story that is not 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.880
 exactly for the same audience as the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.830
 'super mario' arrived sold little 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 both by different proposal 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.060
 extremely innovative for the time as 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.040
 for its poor logistics made by 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.200
 producer for an initial attempt to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.090
 adaptation of the super nintendo version is 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.910
 of the highest quality and turns and moves 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.580
 there appears list of games that should 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.080
 be redone or bolder and creative 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.090
 of all time 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.520
 a year after the harvest could not stand to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.050
 behind is the pressure of the mag is little more 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.930
 close to the story of the original book 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.670
 even if with a good pg you can 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 completely change the style of your 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.840
 character one of the fun parts in 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.330
 gameplay itself is a balance between 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.910
 the class with digital powers that can 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
 hack matrix and attack electronically 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.770
 the samurai that can be equated with 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.650
 claws made yellow rodrigo and also 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.990
 leaves in the beatings and finally the shamans 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 who can use magic this not only avoids 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.500
 that you are an advanced super hacker 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540
 strong may be more days 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.940
 balancing the game but also encourages 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.080
 finish the campaign once more 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 different shapes 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.769
 the latest version of the old consoles 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.110
 came in 1996, and the 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.760
 last game without being done by the 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.799
 be released in the video game 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.750
 it has never been released outside Japan and is 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.190
 very rare playing the price of the copy 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.810
 original in height 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.760
 this version does not roll in the United States 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.340
 like the others, is much more 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.590
 extensive use of dialogues to count 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.900
 a story almost all navigation 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.269
 is done through text and only when 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.970
 necessary the view changes to an angle 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.160
 completely Japanese 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.780
 and out of many standards is difficult 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.480
 find someone who cold this 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.549
 version and it was only in 2007 many years 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.379
 after these three titles made in 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.780
 three front fields of world australia 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.419
 the United States provides the mega drive 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.669
 and Japan you can and from there in the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.010
 90 a version appeared cheddar the 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.720
 xbox 360 and pc brought little 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.460
 related to the original story and 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.350
 decided to change the style for the game 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.960
 completely online shot 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.880
 the end result was a sad number 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.410
 very low sales that ended up 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880
 including with the bankruptcy of the producer 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.610
 shortly after 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.570
 now for 2013 two new versions are 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.130

 And the dawn newspaper is the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.790
 written language somewhere around the screen 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.180
