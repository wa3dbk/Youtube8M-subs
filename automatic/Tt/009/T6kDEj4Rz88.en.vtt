time<00:02:21.650> as<00:02:21.890> somebody<00:02:22.130> who's<00:02:22.549> been<00:02:22.630> what's<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
time as somebody who's been what's the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.120 
time as somebody who's been what's the
term<00:02:23.930> sitting<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.530> ass<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:24.829> why<00:02:24.980> they

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
term sitting on the ass for why they

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220 
term sitting on the ass for why they
haven't<00:02:25.250> been<00:02:25.430> new<00:02:26.000> they're<00:02:26.750> new<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.019> exercise

haven't been new they're new to exercise
yeah<00:02:27.980> only<00:02:28.430> those<00:02:28.609> people<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.660> burn<00:02:29.870> fat<00:02:30.200> and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
yeah only those people can burn fat and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.229 
yeah only those people can burn fat and
build<00:02:30.530> muscle<00:02:30.590> at<00:02:30.859> the<00:02:30.920> same<00:02:31.130> time<00:02:31.370> yeah

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
build muscle at the same time yeah

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.610 
build muscle at the same time yeah
once<00:02:32.420> you've<00:02:32.600> been<00:02:32.690> doing<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.049> while<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.380> us

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
once you've been doing it while like us

once you've been doing it while like us
it's<00:02:33.980> impossible<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.760> build<00:02:35.030> muscle<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.630> burn

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it's impossible to build muscle and burn

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.720 
it's impossible to build muscle and burn
fat<00:02:35.840> at<00:02:36.109> the<00:02:36.170> same<00:02:36.320> time<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.220> only<00:02:37.459> time

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
fat at the same time now the only time

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.140 
fat at the same time now the only time
you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.450> build<00:02:38.660> muscle<00:02:39.200> right<00:02:40.100> for<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.940> most

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
you can build muscle right for the most

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.289 
you can build muscle right for the most
of<00:02:41.390> us<00:02:41.510> unless<00:02:42.470> you're<00:02:42.680> beginner<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:44.000> at

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
you got to figure out how many calories

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.789 
you got to figure out how many calories
are<00:03:41.940> by<00:03:42.060> needs<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:43.200> gain<00:03:43.349> weight<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.709> build

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
are by needs to gain weight and build

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.559 
are by needs to gain weight and build
muscle<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.330> your

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
muscle but this that's what your

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.870 
muscle but this that's what your
approach<00:03:45.900> should<00:03:46.170> be<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:47.040> work<00:03:47.220> just<00:03:47.250> just

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
approach should be just work just just

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.550 
approach should be just work just just
burn<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.420> fat<00:03:48.569> right<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.440> want

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
burn the fat right now some of you want

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.559 
burn the fat right now some of you want
to<00:03:49.590> burn<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.890> fat<00:03:50.040> first<00:03:50.370> yeah<00:03:50.970> once<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.360> burn

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
to burn the fat first yeah once you burn

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.000 
to burn the fat first yeah once you burn
their<00:03:51.780> fat<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.440> steal<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> little<00:03:52.769> bit

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
their fat you can steal a little bit

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.660 
their fat you can steal a little bit
faster

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
faster
