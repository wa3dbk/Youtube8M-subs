one of the great things about

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.820 
one of the great things about
die-cutting<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:06.930> allows<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.589> do

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
here a beautiful lattice cut right here

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.200 
here a beautiful lattice cut right here
and<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.770> doesn't<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.250> much<00:00:17.730> other

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and it really doesn't take much other

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
and it really doesn't take much other
than<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.630> few<00:00:18.810> cranks<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:19.529> machine<00:00:19.920> so

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
than a few cranks of your machine so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.090 
than a few cranks of your machine so
let's<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> look<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.720> works<00:00:22.230> I've

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
let's take a look at how that works I've

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.759 
let's take a look at how that works I've
got<00:00:23.460> another<00:00:23.699> piece<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.269> cardstock<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
got another piece of cardstock here and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
got another piece of cardstock here and
here's<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.490> die<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.349> always<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
here's my die I always like to take a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.720 
here's my die I always like to take a
little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.000> tape<00:00:30.920> scotch<00:00:31.920> tape<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
little bit of tape scotch tape just to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450 
little bit of tape scotch tape just to
tape<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.750> where<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.410> want<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
tape that down right where I want it to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.389 
tape that down right where I want it to
be<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.030> doesn't<00:00:36.680> slip<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.890> slide<00:00:38.450> then<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
be so it doesn't slip or slide then I

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:48.459 
be so it doesn't slip or slide then I
take<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.430> plates<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.980> sandwich<00:00:43.980> her<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:46.879> and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
take my plates and sandwich her up and

00:00:48.469 --> 00:01:01.849 
take my plates and sandwich her up and
then<00:00:49.469> I'm<00:00:49.649> ready<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> crank<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.649> then<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
then I'm ready to crank and then you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
then I'm ready to crank and then you
bring<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.460> down<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.600> take<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bring it back down and you can take a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520 
bring it back down and you can take a
look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.309> intricate<00:01:05.909> design<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> you'll

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
look at the intricate design now you'll

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
look at the intricate design now you'll
see<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:09.510> sometimes<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
see here that sometimes you have a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.370 
see here that sometimes you have a
little<00:01:10.979> problem<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:12.689> you've<00:01:12.869> got<00:01:13.140> these

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little problem that you've got these

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.429 
little problem that you've got these
little<00:01:13.970> sections<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
little sections and so you can kind of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
little sections and so you can kind of
just<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.340> poker<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.240> poke<00:01:18.600> those

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
just take a little poker and poke those

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.429 
just take a little poker and poke those
out<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:20.430> works<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.630> then

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
out that works pretty well and then

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.210 
out that works pretty well and then
sometimes<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.460> stuck<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
sometimes they get stuck in here and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
sometimes they get stuck in here and
you'll<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.430> poke<00:01:27.030> through<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.860> just<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you'll just poke through that just so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.760 
you'll just poke through that just so
that<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.640> die<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.750> clean<00:01:31.259> once<00:01:31.680> again<00:01:32.070> now

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
that your die is clean once again now

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.840 
that your die is clean once again now
