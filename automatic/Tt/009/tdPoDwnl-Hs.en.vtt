00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
skin type so it sounds like it's not

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
skin type so it sounds like it's not
really<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.420> peel<00:01:07.140> since<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.800> whole<00:01:08.070> time

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really a peel since the whole time

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
really a peel since the whole time
you're<00:01:08.970> touching<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> massaging<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> you're

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you're touching and massaging it you're

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.360 
you're touching and massaging it you're
never<00:01:11.040> letting<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.430> sit<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.360> peel<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:13.370> maybe

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
never letting it sit to peel off maybe

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.880 
never letting it sit to peel off maybe
that's<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:14.970> understanding<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> peel

then that's great but I'm also kind of
freaked<00:04:13.480> out<00:04:13.659> because<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:15.060> felt<00:04:16.060> my<00:04:16.269> face

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
freaked out because I felt my face

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.259 
freaked out because I felt my face
coming<00:04:17.169> off<00:04:17.349> if<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.680> was<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.220> case<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.609> felt

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
coming off if that was the case I felt

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.870 
coming off if that was the case I felt
my<00:04:19.750> actual<00:04:20.320> face<00:04:20.530> coming<00:04:21.250> off<00:04:21.549> in<00:04:21.849> my<00:04:22.180> hand<00:04:22.479> and

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
my actual face coming off in my hand and

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.469 
my actual face coming off in my hand and
that's<00:04:24.880> really<00:04:25.180> freaky<00:04:25.630> but<00:04:26.849> if<00:04:27.849> that<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.300> how

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
that's really freaky but if that is how

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.010 
that's really freaky but if that is how
it<00:04:28.539> works<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.380> did<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.620> wrong<00:04:30.030> sorry<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:31.900> if

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
it works if I did it wrong sorry but if

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.379 
it works if I did it wrong sorry but if
that's<00:04:32.139> how<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.500> works<00:04:32.740> then<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.190> guess<00:04:33.669> that

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
that's how it works then I guess that

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.749 
that's how it works then I guess that
this<00:04:34.660> thing<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.590> great<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:37.080> feels<00:04:38.080> wonderful

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
it really really have small pores too

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.430 
it really really have small pores too
because<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.340> feels<00:04:42.669> tight<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:43.900> overall<00:04:44.320> I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
because it feels tight so overall I

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.860 
because it feels tight so overall I
