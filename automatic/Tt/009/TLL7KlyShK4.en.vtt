and as requested I'm doing another one
of<00:00:18.820> these<00:00:18.910> weak<00:00:19.210> spot<00:00:19.420> guides<00:00:19.630> that<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.050> guys

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
of these weak spot guides that you guys

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.990 
of these weak spot guides that you guys
wanted<00:00:20.860> me<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:20.950> do<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:21.369> this<00:00:21.670> time<00:00:21.730> we're<00:00:21.939> gonna

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
wanted me to do so this time we're gonna

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.240 
wanted me to do so this time we're gonna
be<00:00:22.119> doing<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.570> mouse<00:00:22.779> in<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.050> u-100<00:00:23.560> I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
be doing the mouse in the u-100 I

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.920 
be doing the mouse in the u-100 I
figured<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.029> throw<00:00:25.180> these<00:00:25.270> two<00:00:25.450> together<00:00:25.689> just

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
figured I throw these two together just

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.749 
figured I throw these two together just
because<00:00:26.259> there's<00:00:26.650> not<00:00:26.770> as<00:00:26.919> many<00:00:27.040> quirky<00:00:27.490> spots

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
because there's not as many quirky spots

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.550 
because there's not as many quirky spots
that<00:00:28.090> you<00:00:28.240> can<00:00:28.540> throw<00:00:28.840> together<00:00:28.960> like<00:00:29.380> there

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
that you can throw together like there

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.870 
that you can throw together like there
were<00:00:29.680> on<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:29.919> e3<00:00:30.040> there's<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.489> lot<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.730> really

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
were on the e3 there's a lot of really

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.569 
were on the e3 there's a lot of really
weird<00:00:31.090> spaces<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:31.960> can<00:00:32.079> pend<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.410> e3<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.890> I

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
weird spaces you can pend the e3 and I

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.979 
weird spaces you can pend the e3 and I
figured<00:00:33.970> I<00:00:34.059> figured<00:00:34.329> out<00:00:34.390> throw<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> e<00:00:34.690> wanna

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
figured I figured out throw the e wanna

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.540 
figured I figured out throw the e wanna
you<00:00:35.200> 100<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.680> mouse<00:00:35.770> together<00:00:36.070> just<00:00:36.280> because

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
you 100 and mouse together just because

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.850 
you 100 and mouse together just because
there<00:00:36.760> are<00:00:36.850> two<00:00:37.059> very<00:00:37.329> very<00:00:37.630> strong<00:00:38.470> German

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
there are two very very strong German

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.130 
there are two very very strong German
tanks<00:00:39.130> that<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.309> know<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.239> 100's<00:00:40.719> weaknesses

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
tanks that you know the 100's weaknesses

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.510 
tanks that you know the 100's weaknesses
are<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> little<00:00:41.800> bit<00:00:41.980> more<00:00:42.130> obvious

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
are a little bit more obvious

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.250 
are a little bit more obvious
well<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.270> biggest<00:00:43.570> weakness<00:00:43.840> is<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.020> little

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
well the biggest weakness is a little

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.419 
well the biggest weakness is a little
bit<00:00:44.380> more<00:00:44.500> obvious<00:00:44.829> but<00:00:44.950> some<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.280> other

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
bit more obvious but some of the other

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.009 
bit more obvious but some of the other
ones<00:00:45.609> are<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.789> little<00:00:46.089> overshadowed<00:00:46.539> by<00:00:46.960> the

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
ones are a little overshadowed by the

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.569 
ones are a little overshadowed by the
other<00:00:47.230> ones<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.100> first<00:00:48.280> one<00:00:48.399> you're<00:00:48.460> gonna

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
other ones so the first one you're gonna

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.910 
other ones so the first one you're gonna
see<00:00:48.820> here<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.149> turret<00:00:49.390> ring<00:00:49.589> no<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.620> wasn't

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
see here is the turret ring no I wasn't

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.470 
see here is the turret ring no I wasn't
exactly<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:51.579> best<00:00:51.609> tank<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.089> be<00:00:52.179> pending

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
exactly in the best tank to be pending

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.200 
exactly in the best tank to be pending
this<00:00:52.660> reliably<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:54.039> AP<00:00:54.309> shells<00:00:54.550> on<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.789> 121

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
this reliably the AP shells on the 121

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.450 
this reliably the AP shells on the 121
only<00:00:55.510> 258<00:00:56.050> pen<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.499> was<00:00:56.649> shooting<00:00:56.949> up<00:00:57.070> at<00:00:57.280> it

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
only 258 pen and I was shooting up at it

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.399 
only 258 pen and I was shooting up at it
so<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.789> wasn't<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.149> just<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.659> flat<00:00:58.899> 90<00:00:59.170> degrees

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
so it wasn't a just a flat 90 degrees

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.590 
so it wasn't a just a flat 90 degrees
it's<00:01:00.249> it<00:01:00.550> takes<00:01:00.579> me<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.879> couple<00:01:00.940> times<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
it's it takes me a couple times to

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.489 
it's it takes me a couple times to
actually<00:01:02.019> pennant

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
actually pennant

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.320 
actually pennant
you're<00:01:03.399> gonna<00:01:03.519> see<00:01:03.699> here<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:03.820> think<00:01:03.879> I<00:01:04.120> finally

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
you're gonna see here I think I finally

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.149 
you're gonna see here I think I finally
put<00:01:04.629> in<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.960> fourth<00:01:05.199> time<00:01:05.440> when<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.800> shoot<00:01:06.040> the

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
put in the fourth time when I shoot the

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.280 
put in the fourth time when I shoot the
left<00:01:06.310> side<00:01:06.520> but<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.840> spot<00:01:08.080> is<00:01:08.260> a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
left side but this that that spot is a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.980 
left side but this that that spot is a
flat<00:01:08.620> 250<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.670> have<00:01:09.850> like<00:01:10.000> 275<00:01:10.690> pen<00:01:10.900> or

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
flat 250 so if you have like 275 pen or

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.790 
flat 250 so if you have like 275 pen or
something<00:01:11.260> like<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.409> you're<00:01:11.680> gonna

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
something like that you're gonna

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.469 
something like that you're gonna
reliably<00:01:12.280> go<00:01:12.430> go<00:01:12.880> through<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.150> if<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.330> have

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
reliably go go through it if you have

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.469 
reliably go go through it if you have
like<00:01:13.659> a<00:01:13.690> look<00:01:14.590> at<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.800> 50<00:01:15.100> mm<00:01:15.250> or<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.520> Russian

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
like a look at a 50 mm or a Russian

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.430 
like a look at a 50 mm or a Russian
medium<00:01:16.690> or<00:01:16.780> something<00:01:16.960> like<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.080> so<00:01:17.290> there's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
medium or something like that so there's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.280 
medium or something like that so there's
the<00:01:17.560> first<00:01:17.680> one<00:01:17.830> right<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.850> turret<00:01:19.060> ring

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the first one right in the turret ring

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.540 
the first one right in the turret ring
and<00:01:20.290> then<00:01:20.380> this<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.800> one<00:01:20.920> everybody<00:01:21.190> knows

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
and then this is the one everybody knows

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.250 
and then this is the one everybody knows
it's<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.910> good<00:01:22.060> old<00:01:22.090> lower<00:01:22.330> plate<00:01:22.660> that's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
it's the good old lower plate that's

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's the good old lower plate that's
where<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.470> transmissions<00:01:24.040> housed<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.640> you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
where the transmissions housed and you

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.010 
where the transmissions housed and you
can<00:01:25.060> actually<00:01:25.210> shoot<00:01:25.450> down<00:01:25.600> something<00:01:25.840> on

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
can actually shoot down something on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.570 
can actually shoot down something on
fire<00:01:26.200> if<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.500> get<00:01:26.650> lucky<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:27.070> Angie<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.490> hit

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
fire if you get lucky or Angie and hit

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.090 
fire if you get lucky or Angie and hit
modules<00:01:27.970> that's<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.320> can<00:01:29.500> append<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.860> it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
modules that's you can append that it

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.790 
modules that's you can append that it
most<00:01:30.640> angles<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.420> not<00:01:31.630> very<00:01:31.810> hard<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.260> then

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
most angles it's not very hard and then

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160 
most angles it's not very hard and then
here's<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.130> top<00:01:33.670> bar<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.450> only<00:01:34.600> 150

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
here's the top bar this is only 150

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.010 
here's the top bar this is only 150
millimeters<00:01:35.740> thick<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:37.540> can<00:01:37.690> pend<00:01:37.900> that

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
millimeters thick so you can pend that

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.600 
millimeters thick so you can pend that
pretty<00:01:38.260> easily<00:01:38.650> if<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:38.950> can<00:01:39.130> hit<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:39.550> a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
pretty easily if you can hit it it's a

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.400 
pretty easily if you can hit it it's a
pretty<00:01:39.790> small<00:01:39.910> target<00:01:40.450> now<00:01:40.930> one<00:01:41.200> thing<00:01:41.290> I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
pretty small target now one thing I

face hugging the e100 and yours your

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.010 
face hugging the e100 and yours your
tank<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.160> really<00:01:45.430> short<00:01:45.690> you're<00:01:46.690> not<00:01:46.840> actually

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
tank is really short you're not actually

gonna have to either load gold and shoot

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.150 
gonna have to either load gold and shoot
through<00:01:50.320> his<00:01:50.410> turret<00:01:50.710> or<00:01:50.860> you're<00:01:50.950> gonna<00:01:51.070> have

to spam or backup and try to shoot his
letter<00:01:53.050> plate<00:01:53.290> now<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.860> wanted<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.190> say<00:01:54.340> here

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
letter plate now I wanted to say here

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.400 
letter plate now I wanted to say here
that<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.760> viewport<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.360> not<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> hitbox<00:01:55.990> I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that the viewport is not a hitbox I

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.410 
that the viewport is not a hitbox I
repeat<00:01:56.740> not<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.010> hitbox<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.940> hit<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.270> you

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
repeat not a hitbox if you hit it you

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.910 
repeat not a hitbox if you hit it you
won't<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.690> any<00:01:58.870> damage<00:01:59.080> all<00:01:59.410> you're<00:01:59.560> gonna<00:01:59.680> do

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
won't do any damage all you're gonna do

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.710 
won't do any damage all you're gonna do
is<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.340> knock<00:02:00.550> out<00:02:00.700> his<00:02:00.820> viewport<00:02:01.240> if<00:02:01.570> you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
is just knock out his viewport if you

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.940 
is just knock out his viewport if you
hit<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:01.960> lower<00:02:02.110> part<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.590> which<00:02:02.920> is

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
hit the lower part of that which is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.010 
hit the lower part of that which is
consistent<00:02:03.730> with<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.030> actual<00:02:04.510> bar<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:04.930> you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
consistent with the actual bar then you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.360 
consistent with the actual bar then you
will<00:02:05.140> do<00:02:05.290> damage<00:02:05.590> but<00:02:05.830> other<00:02:06.040> than<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.280> just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
will do damage but other than that just

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.980 
will do damage but other than that just
shooting<00:02:06.760> top<00:02:06.910> doesn't<00:02:07.210> do<00:02:07.270> anything<00:02:07.510> and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
shooting top doesn't do anything and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.150 
shooting top doesn't do anything and
then<00:02:08.110> right<00:02:08.289> here<00:02:08.319> is<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.679> good<00:02:08.800> old<00:02:08.920> Drive

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
then right here is the good old Drive

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.580 
then right here is the good old Drive
wheel<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.720> probably<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.440> most

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
wheel that is probably the most

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.020 
wheel that is probably the most
important<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.310> learn<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.670> just<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.000> you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
important one to learn in just so you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.190 
important one to learn in just so you
can<00:02:13.239> track<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.629> keep<00:02:13.780> them<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:13.930> place

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
can track them and keep them in place

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.830 
can track them and keep them in place
and<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:15.819> another<00:02:16.090> thing<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.450> forgot<00:02:16.660> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and then another thing I forgot to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.660 
and then another thing I forgot to
mention<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.290> ice<00:02:17.560> ice<00:02:17.980> tab<00:02:18.250> brought<00:02:18.459> up<00:02:18.550> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
mention that ice ice tab brought up to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670 
mention that ice ice tab brought up to
me<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.690> you're<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> really<00:02:20.500> low<00:02:20.620> to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
me is that if you're in a really low to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.750 
me is that if you're in a really low to
your<00:02:20.890> tank<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.189> you<00:02:21.310> don't<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:21.549> very<00:02:21.640> good

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
your tank and you don't have very good

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.729 
your tank and you don't have very good
pen<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.299> back<00:02:22.599> part<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.079> e100<00:02:23.319> turret<00:02:23.650> is

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
pen that back part of the e100 turret is

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.410 
pen that back part of the e100 turret is
the<00:02:23.829> only<00:02:24.010> spot<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.609> can<00:02:24.790> actually<00:02:24.939> pen

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
the only spot that you can actually pen

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.100 
the only spot that you can actually pen
the<00:02:25.780> e100<00:02:26.079> so<00:02:26.409> that's<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.680> really<00:02:26.829> good

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the e100 so that's a really good

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290 
the e100 so that's a really good
tool<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.950> now<00:02:28.220> on<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.550> mouse<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.090> one

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
tool now now on to the mouse this one

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.640 
tool now now on to the mouse this one
has<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> little<00:02:29.720> bit<00:02:29.840> more<00:02:29.930> quirky<00:02:30.260> spots

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
has a little bit more quirky spots

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.620 
has a little bit more quirky spots
obviously<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.250> lower<00:02:31.370> plate<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.180> 200

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
obviously the lower plate it's 200

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.790 
obviously the lower plate it's 200
millimeters<00:02:32.990> thick<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.320> if<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> angle<00:02:33.770> is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
millimeters thick so if the angle is

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
millimeters thick so if the angle is
that<00:02:33.950> at<00:02:34.040> all<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.280> gonna<00:02:34.370> be<00:02:34.520> pretty<00:02:34.700> tough

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
that at all it's gonna be pretty tough

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.640 
that at all it's gonna be pretty tough
to<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.120> through<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.570> then<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> turret<00:02:36.440> treats

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
to go through and then the turret treats

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
to go through and then the turret treats
here<00:02:36.830> 240<00:02:37.670> millimeters<00:02:38.030> thick<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.450> can

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
here 240 millimeters thick so you can

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.360 
here 240 millimeters thick so you can
pend<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.290> pretty<00:02:39.530> easily<00:02:39.710> with<00:02:39.980> most<00:02:40.190> guns

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
pend that pretty easily with most guns

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.560 
pend that pretty easily with most guns
and<00:02:40.640> then<00:02:40.760> as<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.120> see<00:02:41.240> again<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
and then as you can see again the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.380 
and then as you can see again the
viewport<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:41.960> not<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> hitbox<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> next

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
viewport is not a hitbox now the next

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.180 
viewport is not a hitbox now the next
thing<00:02:44.480> I'm<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.810> show<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:44.960> here<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
thing I'm going to show you here is the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.280 
thing I'm going to show you here is the
actual<00:02:47.060> shooting<00:02:47.390> through<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.690> tracks<00:02:47.960> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
actual shooting through the tracks to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.630 
actual shooting through the tracks to
get<00:02:48.440> through<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.800> side<00:02:49.010> armor<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.430> mouse

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
get through the side armor of the mouse

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520
