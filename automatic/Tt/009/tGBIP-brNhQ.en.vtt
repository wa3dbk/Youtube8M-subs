00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.210
 check load time color 32 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.160
 seconds of loading with hdd without any 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.789
 establish a position now I plan everything 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 it's on the site about toy posing 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.250
 we use the acronym 2013 litizija yes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.990
 bear under the graph 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.769
 to baldin here is such a ssd for replacement 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.680
 winchester 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:40.800
 vertex 3 2 volume 240 gigabyte 240 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 gigabyte we like speed up to 55 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 days 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.230
 now we will have 79 actually 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 put it here and get rid of them 12 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.399
 megabyte a second for 8 drops falls 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 drops speed drops on happy 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 clone was directly without creating 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.369
 image therefore we will connect a box of the lesbian 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:14.460
 3 this and from battle box and accurately 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:18.920
 speed means will not increase until 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 terminated from security policy 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.150
 get out of this list of initially creepy 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.320
 the outcome 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 run but left accordingly 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 which is connected to the 305 it says here that 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.750
 this SSD is working 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.399
 at a dollar speed of 6 gigabits per second 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.340
 It means such a function without any idea at all. 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.860
 part for the function of writing to students there 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.050
 something to me as the distribution of course 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.000
 shadows on knows how the iron group works 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.740
 say the eyes where is written in it 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 there is my cycle of life how many times there 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.399
 maybe even good probably distributed 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.789
 according to different seagulls so that the same is not 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.789
 pecked 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.860
 video if not so write in the comment 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.330
 Disk cloning is completed half of the case 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.459
 too many laptops remake on 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.620
 heart so easy to understand so difficult 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.330
 see which models of samsung ge are very 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.330
 it is difficult there to disassemble 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.049
 let's get to summer before the same 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.690
 you need to completely cover the entire bottom 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:41.400
 unscrew to clean the fan 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.400
 need to have a laptop yes Vitka to play 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.750
 understands surprisingly achivku 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.829
 screws screwed here the same 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.989
 bolts that fasten the cover here 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.320
 guide which skids clings 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.790
 that is, we just take dad avoiding 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:04.540
 we get you 64-bit live-you can 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.910
 otherwise I would not have seen 8 gigs 4 on my 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.660
 bag he stands now 4 tugovit just 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.080
 three cone 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.910
 1 person, in fact, he himself is 2 1 and up to 4 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.030
 that moment you will become became 750 gigabytes 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.580
 will be used as personal 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.650
 doctor burglar on at the thought of cram 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.130
 happens instead of a wood hatch because 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.230
 I do not need nafig but look at 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.250
 internet 9 in Chinese these i am somewhere 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.910
 on chinese family cool sketch there 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.470
 such box is inserted into this 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.420
 the box comes with a screw and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.110
 use the second part shows 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.010
 practice 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.980
 sit here to let him go than there 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.670
 the system will deliver it very rarely 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.400
 simpler 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.090
 somewhere to take or buy a portable blue 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.270
 you love 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:04.000
 so everyone screwed these paste back 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.310
 growing up any try start up 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.310
 do not start anything run 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.730
 and where is the windows screensaver or they changed 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.520
 13 44 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:33.370
 and 30 years, yes, let's check 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.680
 already copied to copy 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.710
 view speed copy 172 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.380
 tsiferku noticed megabytes per second 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.870
 a taxi is not to give us more salt for 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.540
 I cheated seven and nine will be here 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.200
 7 8 rational maximum speed 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.360
 use by 20 40 megabytes a second remember her 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.130
 take released as a microdrive was called 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.870
 or what one gigabyte here is such a 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.440
 small hard drive yes now he is 750 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.100
 gigabyte 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.280
 easy easy listen something to easy 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.110
 considering one record most likely to you 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 need still lies the hard drive on 40 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:17.910
 gigabyte or 40 megabyte 40 megabyte 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:25.380
 so there is or pulled 600 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:30.030
 583 is cool from here anyway 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.030
 I liked how everything is understood 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.050
 Yes, I like the little screen very much before and 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.070
 now generally flies 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.070
 subotich thanks for the help
