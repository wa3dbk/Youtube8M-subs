came to simran University to do my PhD
in<00:00:05.970> astrophysics<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:07.040> was<00:00:08.040> born<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.550> way<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
in astrophysics I was born this way I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.480 
in astrophysics I was born this way I
was<00:00:09.210> always<00:00:09.450> scientist<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.559> think<00:00:10.830> since<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.460> was

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
was always scientist I think since I was

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150 
was always scientist I think since I was
the<00:00:11.730> kid<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> was<00:00:12.059> always<00:00:12.210> interested<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:13.160> an

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the kid I was always interested on an

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.029 
the kid I was always interested on an
astronomy<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.570> science<00:00:16.049> not<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
astronomy but in the science not in the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.990 
astronomy but in the science not in the
romantic<00:00:17.600> sky<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:19.020> never<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> telescope<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
romantic sky I never had a telescope I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.250 
romantic sky I never had a telescope I
don't<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.420> one<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.470> did<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:23.119> books

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
don't have one now but I did have books

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.960 
don't have one now but I did have books
what<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> wanted<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.189> study<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.760> very

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
what I wanted to do is study the very

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.990 
what I wanted to do is study the very
first<00:00:27.390> stars<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.320> galaxies<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.519> were<00:00:29.640> form

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
first stars and galaxies that were form

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.690 
first stars and galaxies that were form
in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> universe<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.250> first

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
in the universe and how this first

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
in the universe and how this first
galaxies<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:34.110> modified<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:36.410> universe<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
galaxies have modified the universe in

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.660 
galaxies have modified the universe in
simran<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.730> found<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.750> exact<00:00:40.350> thing<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.250> wanted

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
simran I found the exact thing I wanted

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.920 
simran I found the exact thing I wanted
to<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:44.040> universe<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:44.910> were<00:00:45.690> is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to do the universe right now were is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.920 
to do the universe right now were is
fully<00:00:46.440> ionized<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> his<00:00:47.399> beans<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.660> been

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
fully ionized and his beans it's been

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.569 
fully ionized and his beans it's been
ionized<00:00:49.530> since<00:00:50.480> 13<00:00:51.480> billion<00:00:52.079> years<00:00:52.320> ago<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
ionized since 13 billion years ago so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
ionized since 13 billion years ago so
there<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.170> stage<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.410> history<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there was this stage in the history of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.209 
there was this stage in the history of
the<00:00:56.460> universe<00:00:56.789> called<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.770> realization<00:00:58.770> epic

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the universe called the realization epic

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.360 
the universe called the realization epic
when<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.059> big<00:01:00.359> massive<00:01:00.719> change<00:01:01.370> happening

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
when this big massive change happening

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.770 
when this big massive change happening
where<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> properties<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.979> galaxies

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
where are the properties of the galaxies

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
where are the properties of the galaxies
responsables<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> realization<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
responsables of the realization and the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.250 
responsables of the realization and the
enrichment<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.070> intergalactic<00:01:11.430> medium

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
enrichment of the intergalactic medium

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
enrichment of the intergalactic medium
so<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.590> Swinburne<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.909> access<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so here in Swinburne we have access to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.469 
so here in Swinburne we have access to
top<00:01:16.470> technology<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.640> access<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
top technology we also have access to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
top technology we also have access to
the<00:01:18.689> biggest<00:01:18.840> telescope<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.159> which

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the biggest telescope right now which

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
the biggest telescope right now which
are<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> Keck<00:01:21.270> telescope<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.380> can

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
are the Keck telescope and we can

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.490 
are the Keck telescope and we can
control<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> bottom<00:01:24.210> floor<00:01:24.810> yeah

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
control them from the bottom floor yeah

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.469 
control them from the bottom floor yeah
I<00:01:25.799> got<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.869> had<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.070> idea<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.850> my

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I got here I had no idea about my
