high<00:01:18.690> key<00:01:18.900> lighting<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.620> you<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
high key lighting is when you have a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.130 
high key lighting is when you have a
very<00:01:20.490> strong<00:01:20.880> relationship<00:01:21.180> between<00:01:21.810> your

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
of the greatest people that I ever had a

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.610 
of the greatest people that I ever had a
chance<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.300> work<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.480> now<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> very

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
chance to work with now that's a very

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.850 
chance to work with now that's a very
early<00:01:35.120> shot<00:01:36.120> shot<00:01:36.510> on<00:01:36.660> film<00:01:36.930> late<00:01:37.380> afternoon

early shot shot on film late afternoon

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.360 
early shot shot on film late afternoon
light<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.280> roof<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.580> my<00:01:39.330> daylight<00:01:39.720> studio

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
light on the roof of my daylight studio

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.560 
light on the roof of my daylight studio
but<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.520> light<00:01:41.730> was<00:01:41.760> pretty<00:01:42.150> bright<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.420> his

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
but the light was pretty bright in his

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.180 
but the light was pretty bright in his
eyes<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:43.800> sexy

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
eyes but I think it's a very sexy

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.350 
eyes but I think it's a very sexy
picture<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.550> Leo<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.150> lights

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
picture of Leo I think the lights

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.690 
picture of Leo I think the lights
sculpting<00:01:45.870> his<00:01:45.960> face<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:46.440> well<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sculpting his face really well and I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.700 
sculpting his face really well and I
think<00:01:47.970> he's<00:01:48.060> very<00:01:48.120> focused

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620 

the<00:01:55.310> eyes<00:01:55.430> are<00:01:55.670> really<00:01:55.760> bit<00:01:56.000> telling<00:01:56.330> part<00:01:56.510> of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the eyes are really bit telling part of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.630 
the eyes are really bit telling part of
a<00:01:56.690> portrait<00:01:57.050> they're<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.920> most<00:01:58.070> important

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
a portrait they're the most important

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.190 
a portrait they're the most important
part<00:01:58.910> I<00:01:59.090> think<00:01:59.150> because<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.960> read<00:02:00.170> a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
part I think because you can read a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.190 
part I think because you can read a
picture<00:02:00.620> instantly<00:02:01.040> I<00:02:01.540> like<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.690> person<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
picture instantly I like the person to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.970 
picture instantly I like the person to
be<00:02:03.320> front<00:02:03.920> stage<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.550> center<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.800> tend<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.830> like

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
be front stage and center I tend to like

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.620 
be front stage and center I tend to like
to<00:02:07.130> shoot<00:02:07.280> my<00:02:07.430> subjects<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:07.940> dark<00:02:08.240> clothes

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
to shoot my subjects in dark clothes

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.100 
to shoot my subjects in dark clothes
very<00:02:09.110> minimal<00:02:09.530> backgrounds<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.960> want<00:02:11.960> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
very minimal backgrounds I want the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.140 
very minimal backgrounds I want the
picture<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.530> frame<00:02:12.830> up<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
picture to frame up this because this is
