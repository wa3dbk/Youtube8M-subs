00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
flavor you know it takes a little bit of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.930 
flavor you know it takes a little bit of
time<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:51.410> Lisa<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> deal

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
time for this but Lisa get the deal

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
time for this but Lisa get the deal
instead<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.420> anyways<00:01:00.500> cuz<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.620> use

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
instead of just using anyways cuz I use

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
instead of just using anyways cuz I use
coconut<00:01:02.039> oil<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.940> cook<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.480> its<00:01:03.930> maintains

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
coconut oil to cook with its maintains

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.999 
coconut oil to cook with its maintains
its<00:01:05.869> structure<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.899> lot<00:01:07.020> better<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.470> high<00:01:07.740> heat

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
its structure a lot better in high heat

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.830 
its structure a lot better in high heat
much<00:01:08.640> better<00:01:08.850> than<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.180> things<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> canola

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
much better than like things like canola

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
much better than like things like canola
oil<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.759> good<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:11.970> cook<00:01:12.149> actually<00:01:12.420> with

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
oil so it's good to cook actually with

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.920 
oil so it's good to cook actually with
and<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.390> solid<00:01:15.689> at

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and it's you can see it's like solid at

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.730 
and it's you can see it's like solid at
room<00:01:15.960> temperature<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:17.810> guess<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:21.740> -

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
room temperature just guess with it -

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.250 
room temperature just guess with it -
about<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.130> medium-high<00:01:23.520> heat

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
about a medium-high heat

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.240 
about a medium-high heat
so<00:01:25.260> it's<00:01:25.350> probably<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.710> hot<00:01:26.010> right<00:01:26.040> now

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so it's probably a little hot right now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.020 
so it's probably a little hot right now
so<00:01:26.580> I'm<00:01:27.060> gonna<00:01:27.210> take<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:29.070> mix<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.850> did

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so I'm gonna take to mix that I just did

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
so I'm gonna take to mix that I just did
and<00:01:31.610> throw<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> oven<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.560> had<00:01:34.560> wasn't

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and throw it on the oven I had wasn't

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.249 
and throw it on the oven I had wasn't
hot<00:01:34.979> enough<00:01:35.240> usually<00:01:36.240> makes<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> nice<00:01:36.810> sizzling

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hot enough usually makes a nice sizzling

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.600 
hot enough usually makes a nice sizzling
sound<00:01:37.500> alright<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.280> our<00:01:38.400> almost

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
sound alright so there's our almost

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
sound alright so there's our almost
cooked<00:01:38.880> nice

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
cooked nice

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
little trick that I use I got a plate

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.940 
little trick that I use I got a plate

top

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.399 

now<00:01:57.820> before<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> start<00:01:58.270> adding<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.810> spinach<00:01:59.260> on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
now before I start adding the spinach on

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.660 
now before I start adding the spinach on
to<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.619> I<00:01:59.680> like<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.010> little<00:02:00.220> bit<00:02:00.369> she's

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
to it I like that a little bit she's

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
to it I like that a little bit she's
gives<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.570> little<00:02:01.810> bit<00:02:01.900> more<00:02:02.049> protein

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
gives a little bit more protein

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.389 
gives a little bit more protein
makes<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.289> bit<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.560> stinky<00:02:05.039> for<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
makes it a bit more stinky for the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.480 
makes it a bit more stinky for the
spinach

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
spinach

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.249 
spinach
should<00:02:08.060> probably<00:02:08.149> have<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.600> pre-prepared

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
should probably have this pre-prepared

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.520 
should probably have this pre-prepared
but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
but

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.350 
but

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this little crazy thing that's good I

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.420 
this little crazy thing that's good I
got<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> spinach<00:02:14.410> left<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.340> I'm<00:02:15.400> going

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
got a bit of spinach left so I'm going

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.420 
got a bit of spinach left so I'm going
to<00:02:15.580> use<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.850> up<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> expiry<00:02:18.430> dates
