I<00:00:24.140> gotta<00:00:25.140> shave<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:26.099> heels<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.550> just

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
I gotta shave here with my heels I just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.999 
I gotta shave here with my heels I just
wanted<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.270> go<00:00:27.390> over<00:00:27.660> real<00:00:27.840> quick<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.710> proper

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
wanted to go over real quick the proper

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.140 
wanted to go over real quick the proper
way<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.430> stuff<00:00:29.670> BAM

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
way to use this stuff BAM

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.490 
way to use this stuff BAM
as<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.450> in<00:00:30.570> paragliding<00:00:31.020> most

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
as you know in paragliding most

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.810 
as you know in paragliding most
paraglider<00:00:31.860> pilots<00:00:32.189> will<00:00:32.279> fold<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.640> their

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
paraglider pilots will fold up their

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
paraglider pilots will fold up their
gliders<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.720> pretty<00:00:34.080> compact<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> with

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gliders in a pretty compact way and with

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
gliders in a pretty compact way and with
new<00:00:35.309> technology<00:00:35.340> they've<00:00:36.059> adapted<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> way

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
new technology they've adapted the way

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.080 
new technology they've adapted the way
that<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.610> paramotor

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that they do so as we know paramotor

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.420 
that they do so as we know paramotor
pilots<00:00:39.410> you<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.739> time<00:00:40.949> for<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
pilots you don't have time for that so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.570 
pilots you don't have time for that so
we<00:00:41.970> generally<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.449> stuff<00:00:42.780> bag<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.580> stuff

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
we generally use a stuff bag and stuff

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.189 
we generally use a stuff bag and stuff
bag<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> stuff<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.019> glider

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
bag is just that you stuff the glider

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.670 
bag is just that you stuff the glider
into<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.120> should<00:00:51.510> adapt<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.380> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
into it but we also should adapt to the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580 
into it but we also should adapt to the
gear<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.100> fly<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.750> newer<00:00:55.050> glider<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
gear we fly so with a newer glider like

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.940 
gear we fly so with a newer glider like
this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> epsilon<00:00:56.190> 7<00:00:57.410> there's<00:00:58.410> no<00:00:58.590> mylar

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
this is the epsilon 7 there's no mylar

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.040 
this is the epsilon 7 there's no mylar
in<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.700> leading<00:01:00.510> edge<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.750> entirely

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
in it and it's leading edge is entirely

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
in it and it's leading edge is entirely
formed<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:01.530> nylon<00:01:01.739> rod<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> wouldn't

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
formed with nylon rod so you wouldn't

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.440 
formed with nylon rod so you wouldn't
want<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> deform<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:05.180> typically<00:01:06.180> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
want to deform that so we typically do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.139 
want to deform that so we typically do
just<00:01:06.720> an<00:01:06.840> adaptation<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.920> way<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
just an adaptation of the way to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.880 
just an adaptation of the way to
accordion<00:01:09.149> fold<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> glider<00:01:09.660> set<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.710> the

accordion fold a glider set it on the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
center of the glider is all the lines in

center of the glider is all the lines in

the center leave the risers out now

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810 
the center leave the risers out now
we'll<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:22.080> stack<00:01:22.820> each

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
we'll go and actually stack each

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.050 
we'll go and actually stack each
