00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
body we have a number of modules you can

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
body we have a number of modules you can
put<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.700> them<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.090> put<00:00:33.300> an<00:00:33.390> SDI<00:00:33.809> module

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
put into them you can put an SDI module

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.560 
put into them you can put an SDI module
get<00:00:34.590> SDI<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
get SDI in and out we also have a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.900 
get SDI in and out we also have a
transcode<00:00:37.350> output<00:00:37.739> module<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> could

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
transcode output module so you could

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.660 
transcode output module so you could
take<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.210> HDMI<00:00:39.809> en<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.890> two<00:00:41.129> streams<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
take your HDMI en and get two streams of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850 
take your HDMI en and get two streams of
SDI<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> video<00:00:42.960> village<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
SDI out for the video village so this is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.680 
SDI out for the video village so this is
really<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.219> modular<00:00:44.910> monitor<00:00:45.390> system

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really a modular monitor system

will walk across the three yes it is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
will walk across the three yes it is
absolutely<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.079> had<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.710> number<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
absolutely so if you had a number of

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.440 
absolutely so if you had a number of
these<00:01:35.820> monitors<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.600> same<00:01:36.840> modules<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.560> be

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
these monitors the same modules would be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.850 
these monitors the same modules would be
compatible<00:01:39.450> throughout<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> line<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.650> one

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
compatible throughout the line and one

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.719 
compatible throughout the line and one
of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> things<00:01:41.100> I've<00:01:41.340> always<00:01:41.490> liked<00:01:41.700> the

marshall mathers is the built

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.500 
marshall mathers is the built
waveform<00:01:43.920> there's<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.190> really<00:01:44.400> important<00:01:45.330> part

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
waveform there's a really important part

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.690 
waveform there's a really important part
of<00:01:45.750> digital<00:01:46.350> cinematography<00:01:46.650> especially<00:01:47.640> at

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
of digital cinematography especially at

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
of digital cinematography especially at
the<00:01:47.760> lower<00:01:47.940> end<00:01:48.180> button<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.810> through<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the lower end button right through the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.320 
the lower end button right through the
range<00:01:49.350> exactly<00:01:50.250> SLR<00:01:50.670> shooters<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
range exactly SLR shooters this is a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.200 
range exactly SLR shooters this is a
great<00:01:51.630> entry<00:01:52.080> point<00:01:52.280> exactly<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.580> really

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
great entry point exactly you really

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.640 
great entry point exactly you really
don't<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.540> where<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.170> looking<00:01:55.440> through

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
don't know where you are looking through

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.700 
don't know where you are looking through
this<00:01:56.070> DSLR<00:01:56.880> camera<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.480> we<00:01:57.690> have<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> waveform

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this DSLR camera so we have a waveform

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.250 
this DSLR camera so we have a waveform
monitor<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> actually<00:02:00.090> program<00:02:00.510> high<00:02:01.050> and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
monitor we can actually program high and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.290 
monitor we can actually program high and
low<00:02:01.410> points<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.610> instance<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.180> wanted

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
low points so for instance if you wanted

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.570 
low points so for instance if you wanted
to<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.630> any<00:02:03.900> time<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.320> were<00:02:04.440> over<00:02:04.470> 90<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.160> re

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
to know any time you were over 90 I re

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.880 
to know any time you were over 90 I re
in<00:02:05.940> your<00:02:06.090> picture<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:06.930> could<00:02:07.140> show<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.650> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
in your picture we could show it on that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.430 
in your picture we could show it on that
waveform<00:02:08.340> monitor<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.510> set<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> low<00:02:09.990> limit

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
waveform monitor we can set a low limit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
waveform monitor we can set a low limit
too<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.100> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.460> right<00:02:11.490> here<00:02:11.850> let<00:02:12.360> me

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
too so you can see right here let me

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
too so you can see right here let me
have<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.630> climb<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.960> gold<00:02:13.290> cross<00:02:13.530> between<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.040> one

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
have a climb a gold cross between a one

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.160 
have a climb a gold cross between a one
for<00:02:14.520> one<00:02:14.730> hundred<00:02:14.850> percent<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:15.750> goes

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
for one hundred percent actually goes

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.800 
for one hundred percent actually goes
red<00:02:16.440> exactly<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.730> not<00:02:17.850> always<00:02:18.060> easy<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.510> see

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
red exactly it's not always easy to see

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
red exactly it's not always easy to see
when<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.290> over<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.400> he

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
when you go over that's right if he

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.010 
when you go over that's right if he
calls<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.150> least<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.510> which<00:02:21.720> part

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
calls right at least you know which part

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.240 
calls right at least you know which part
of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.200> image<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.440> going<00:02:22.680> red<00:02:22.830> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.100> make<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of the image is going red you can make a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
of the image is going red you can make a
decision<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.330> let<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:24.630> if<00:02:24.900> you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
decision on do you let it go if you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050 
decision on do you let it go if you
bring<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.350> back<00:02:25.470> exactly<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.430> exactly<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
bring it back exactly so exactly a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.880 
bring it back exactly so exactly a
particularly<00:02:27.540> interested<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.050> these<00:02:28.200> nine

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
particularly interested in these nine

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.660 
particularly interested in these nine
inch<00:02:29.190> monitors<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.570> always<00:02:30.870> felt<00:02:31.200> that

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
inch monitors because I always felt that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.430 
inch monitors because I always felt that
whilst<00:02:32.670> five<00:02:33.060> point<00:02:33.390> six<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.990> seven<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.410> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
whilst five point six and seven is a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.410 
whilst five point six and seven is a
great<00:02:34.710> size<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.640> nice<00:02:35.820> thing<00:02:35.850> about<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.240> nine

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
great size the nice thing about the nine

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.470 
great size the nice thing about the nine
is<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.990> your<00:02:37.560> full-size<00:02:38.250> image<00:02:38.550> but

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
is you can have your full-size image but

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.570 
is you can have your full-size image but
also<00:02:39.720> all<00:02:40.110> your<00:02:40.290> data<00:02:40.500> displayed<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> not

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
also all your data displayed and not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.700 
also all your data displayed and not
compromise<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:42.420> framing<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.050> shop<00:02:43.350> right

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
compromise the framing of the shop right

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.980 
compromise the framing of the shop right
so<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.610> your<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:45.210> for<00:02:45.420> monterosso

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
so here we have your way for monterosso

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.320 
so here we have your way for monterosso
have<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.170> clip<00:02:46.500> feature<00:02:46.980> where<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.940> see<00:02:48.300> I

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
have a clip feature where you can see I

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.120 
have a clip feature where you can see I
have<00:02:48.480> blue<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.020> yellow<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.380> I've<00:02:49.739> set<00:02:49.950> my

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
have blue and yellow and I've set my

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.280 
have blue and yellow and I've set my
Clippy<00:02:50.520> now<00:02:50.700> anything<00:02:51.030> below<00:02:51.360> 10<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.050> blue

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
Clippy now anything below 10 is in blue

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.100 
Clippy now anything below 10 is in blue
anything<00:02:53.100> above<00:02:53.340> 90<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.090> yellow<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
anything above 90 is in yellow here and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
anything above 90 is in yellow here and
I<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.590> even<00:02:55.709> apply<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.520> waveform

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I can even apply that to the waveform

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
I can even apply that to the waveform
monitor<00:02:57.360> once<00:02:57.540> again<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.080> get<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
monitor once again so you get a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
monitor once again so you get a
diagnostic<00:02:59.459> read<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.820> right<00:03:00.030> there<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.239> the
