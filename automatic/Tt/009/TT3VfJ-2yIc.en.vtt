00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.940
 hi to all this fps today we get 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.140
 found for a year earlier I'm going 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.570
 show you how to win several 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.400
 thousands see if you're fast enough 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.930
 several million dollars in 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.730
 only a few minutes you go 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.970
 see that it's going to be pretty epic 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.379
 so first up for that you 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.770
 go to the left side 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.900
 so is addressing the coast and our costs to 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.790
 have to go to 7 in croatia where 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.710
 that they lie a little 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.210
 finally in the ocean but not very good 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.610
 you will see right away 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.530
 in a few seconds we are there but I 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.280
 advises you first went up here 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.420
 so with a car or whatever because if 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.720
 you go here actually you go 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.619
 just take paris cinema and you go 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.570
 to be able to find records and so that 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.920
 will be faster for you to go and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:16.140
 come here will take skiing that alloy 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.140
 directly to the points 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.270
 why this but get here by then 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.030
 you are going to go to the weight 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.620
 I will show you finally arrived the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.400
 point for you to revisit one more 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.130
 once we see you it's going pretty 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.520
 quickly in just a few seconds we are 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 come 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.200
 so the point here he is here I'm going 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.270
 show you 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.460
 so if you look at you take the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.560
 corner of this street with the corner of that 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.510
 this and that is more or less the better 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 all that you can you is no longer or 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.840
 less 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.510
 then you get off of your 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.220
 management you 're going to press r2 if 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.330
 you are on ps3 and I believe that on 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.970
 xbox touched rt but I'm not 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.450
 sure like that it's going to allow you to 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.420
 plunge 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.370
 you see well below that there is a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 boat 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.470
 then you will have to find a 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.590
 small a small package so the little 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 package it's right here it's I 'm going to the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.410
 see and this little package will you 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.990
 allow to win 25 thousand dollars 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.080
 then you will change character 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.270
 says you have it you go by 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.280
 example on michael or so on truce 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.990
 finally here it's because I have 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 franklin but you change the character 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:47.140
 in any case then we wait until we 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.140
 the switch console 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.650
 then you will relapse to two 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.630
 characters directly you pick up the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.350
 same character that you were in 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:10.120
 the ocean just before that and you go 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.770
 power that the package has reappeared 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.050
 and here I regain $ 25,000 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.000
 then you do the same again for 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.780
 praised the bottom then you change 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.780
 two characters 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.660
 every time you will have to wait 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.400
 that his suite and you redo the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.090
 manipulation as much seal as you 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.990
 so I hope you like 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.010
 in any case if the case do not forget to 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.350

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.270
