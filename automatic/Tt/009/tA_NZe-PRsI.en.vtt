00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
our sensors we're going to do a reset of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.050 
our sensors we're going to do a reset of
the<00:01:38.960> CPMs<00:01:39.500> system<00:01:39.860> by<00:01:40.280> doing<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.670> we<00:01:40.909> go<00:01:41.000> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
the CPMs system by doing that we go to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.020 
the CPMs system by doing that we go to
the<00:01:41.179> main<00:01:41.330> menu<00:01:41.590> scroll<00:01:42.590> down<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.770> reset<00:01:43.280> hit

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
the main menu scroll down to reset hit

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.719 
the main menu scroll down to reset hit
yes<00:01:44.319> then<00:01:45.319> we're<00:01:45.470> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.619> go<00:01:45.710> find<00:01:45.950> our<00:01:46.159> make

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
yes then we're going to go find our make

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.930 
yes then we're going to go find our make
Toyota<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:48.220> for<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.280> one<00:01:49.429> you<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.670> need<00:01:49.850> to

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
Toyota and for this one you do need to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.300 
Toyota and for this one you do need to
know<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.210> make<00:01:50.390> model<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.899> year<00:01:51.219> then<00:01:52.219> we're

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
know the make model and year then we're

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.819 
know the make model and year then we're
going<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.460> go<00:01:52.579> down<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.880> Camry<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:54.469> we<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:54.799> a

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
going to go down to Camry and we have a

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.810 
going to go down to Camry and we have a
2008<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.540> we'll<00:01:56.659> just<00:01:56.810> select<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:58.250> hit<00:01:58.640> Y

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
2008 so we'll just select that to hit Y

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.429 
2008 so we'll just select that to hit Y
for<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.240> yes

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
for you yes

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.080 
for you yes
we're<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> select<00:02:02.159> four<00:02:02.549> wheels<00:02:02.760> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
we're going to select four wheels and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.460 
we're going to select four wheels and
we're<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> basically<00:02:03.659> repeat<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> same
