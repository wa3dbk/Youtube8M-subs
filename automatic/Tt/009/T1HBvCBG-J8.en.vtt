00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.520
 the car dot producer with an informative flash about the collection d 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.830
 soy in the country caves garcía he is the president of corpozulia venga 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.929
 for wilman was dry 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.539
 it's a pleasure to have you 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.949
 in this presentation we tell the harvesters that they can continue in their 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.470
 work 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 that the collection of this legume begins with which guideline of 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.079
 marketing after he the stonemason you had a committee 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.490
 advisory with 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.280
 Ministry of Agriculture to the Industry the Launcher of the Producers 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.989
 at this moment we are leading as you can see 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.160
 the mechanical harvesting of Swedish-Danish instead of two concepts 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.670
 combine direct with expectation of what 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 percent is of this grain fencing and marketing 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.620
 Maybe I'm going to send you to the Indian city of Sao, which is the only one 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.070
 block employees is acting 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 and next week I hope the fan of the whole amount of the bull opens 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 of industrial 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.410
 hitters to buy full national grain production 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.160
 the insistence of the advisory committee was you 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.320
 the rookie eric authors as we have always seen them 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.050
 forced to press given circumstances that the crop over and that can not 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.619
 pay 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.630
 I make it arrive and we have to reinvent the product under any 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.470
 circumstance evidence social climate policy story that he knows nothing 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.970
 of that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.790
 expectations of the current production that in it since this week its 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.200
 pickup is pretty good hopefully the yields 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.409
 this is one of two tons per hectare and in this lot 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.080
 is greater than the national average that is 1 points 5 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.370
 everyone believes where we are 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.410
 the spokesman in windows of the police in the periods we are at five 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.640
 kilometers from the city 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.170
 in a field of psoe had a magnet garcía 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.090
 but it kills 15 thousand people at least they are following this signal 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.070
 informative 2 we have made the commercialization of soy the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.940
 price 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.890
 i 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.220
 spend all the payment as until this year 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.200
 the price was agreed on 25 50 and we expect the payment to be maximum in 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.120
 eight days 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.880
 part allowed the producers to steal and with that pay the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.579
 economic obligations 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.909
 for the rival that is deafening but we can also comment network 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.089
 of something that was in the very productive area 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:23.489
 that is turning to the cultivation of the African palm but the corn this one 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.399
 was left 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.469
 the country still does not know the Portuguese as white as you could say the 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.069
 farmers 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.469
 conversation workshops with the industrial sector 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.499
 so that it collects all the production of the national harvest that is also 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.409
 exactly quantifies the price but we have of and followed this 50 I hope 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.549
 to be fulfilled because you see there is some resistance from the sector 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.500
 marcelo from the producing sector with corn rice marketer 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.309
 to purchase the national harvest of the summer cycle 2011 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.929
 the producer point with which appreciation can not be 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:59.479
 of the productivity of yours because we have not improved on that 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.209
 new decorated basically by the absence of improved seeds by 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.100
 the recycling of seeds 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.790
 of asean from long ago 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.800
 but let's hope that line for memory that the works of 102 8 percent and 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.160
 soon you will be varas until others more our level of productivity goes up 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.630
 hamas logically from good handling 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.840
 I read that isaza at the end with a very good marketing 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.669
 complements 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.489
 this year which is similar to last year did not present 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.059
 the problem of diseases 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:30.440
 percent like this we have problems of higher disease burden and weed 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.680
 it is because of the presence of enough humidity this facilitates the presence of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.060
 Congo and pests 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.050
 but the level code productivity has also increased then there is a 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.920
 compensation and of sense ignorance in quarters had estimated the cost of 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.959
 this year's production 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.799
 the council wish of this year is around 22 2 50 the vital and with a 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.659
 selling price of 25 50 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.989
 if there is a slight utility at the moment 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.469
 as some say the soy disappear 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.980
 no fingers beds like farmers 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.930
 percent is let's stop and already a slogan that we have copied from the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.729
 last contest 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.780
 national police tail cone 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.389
 the plain we resist 2d and we go and so the senate am 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.649
 but in other countries its great demand is like being here in the country 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.579
 fell the consumption of the rise let's hope that the state policy 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.040
 to use them or day as human food 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.990
 because the vegetable protein 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.720
 which would indicate what to put malnutrition especially in the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.190
 children 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.000
 I suggest the presence of republic that there is a politics of the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.120
 school snack 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.539
 based on soy milk 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.569
 and this would greatly help to convert malnutrition 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.760
 for that reason he emphasized harvest promise 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.840
 today we started the harvest hopefully next week 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.290
 percent and does 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.350
 perfection and completed the industrials of the euro zone there will be no 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.289
 bottling let's hope there's no tomorrow 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.360
 well maybe we'll have to go back 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.240
 we thank you in 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.569
 a minute and people to say goodbye from the window sector 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.610
 d in the province of rivers 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.589
 one of the most agricultural producing provinces 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.559
 welfare for many people and let's hope that in soybean cultivation we do not have 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:09.639
 complications from here to the future 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.639
 70 direct from etón the hike 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.689
 74 thousand tons expected as a base we hope to overcome the terrain a bit 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.129
 more in the contest 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.180
 the deficit 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.100
 they need this industry really not of this progression to parliament gives 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.710
 one month of national consumption eleven table and that matters 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.539
 good did not take off from this place of the motherland 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.909
 the producer point with I bought with you
