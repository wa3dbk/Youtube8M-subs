00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:08.567
Brazilian Gastronomy Identity

00:00:19.363 --> 00:00:24.907
The unit of the brazilian gastronomy does not exist yet. It is under construction.

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:28.434
Brazilian gastronomy is a process,

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:34.222
it's not a ready reality, due to a very simple factor:

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:39.008
nacional gastronomy is made from regional gastronomy.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.287
You can talk about italian gastronomy, for example,

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:47.700
but each region in Italy has completely diferent food.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.402
What is the italian gastronomy? It is the joint of what is best in all of the regional cousine

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:57.991
It's the same in France. It's a result of historical processes that took place in those countries

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:03.676
since the 19th century. It took too long in Brazil, because of our

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:10.127
historical peculiarities, like the royal portuguese family that came here. So we spent from 100 to 150 years

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:17.680
valuing foreign gastronomy, such as the french, italian and spanish gastronomy.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.365
And we didn't pay attention at all

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.384
to the nacional cuisine that kept being developed regionally.

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:34.631
So we have a beautiful nacional gastronomy, that 20, 30 years ago

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:39.854
started giving elements to form a brazilian gastronomy.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:45.481
We have a huge regional cuisine which is the cuisine from Minas Gerais, the "mineira" cuisine

00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:50.479
Actually, it is half "mineira", and the other half from São Paulo. It began in São Paulo

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.909
and started to be more developed in Minas Gerais since the 18th century due to the golden age.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.572
This cuisine, actually, has sub-regions

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:08.270
for example, we have the region of the Paraíba Valley, that it is really close to the "mineira" gastronomy.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.639
We also have the cuisine from the interior of São Paulo state, although it uses many elements of the "mineira"`

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.227
gastronomy, it has also fish, which is not so much used in Minas Gerais.

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:25.521
Then we have another regional cuisine, that is very important: the cuisine from Amazonia

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:31.697
The amazon cuisine is the most native cuisine we have

00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:35.514
It's the one that kept all the indians traces

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:41.480
The cuisine of northeastern hinterland and the coastal region, which are completely different.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.515
You can't talk about northeastern gastronomy, it is false.

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:54.065
We have a hinterland gastronomy, which uses salted meat, milk sub products

00:02:54.065 --> 00:03:01.189
and vegetables, that is very interesting.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.599
And you have the gastronomy from the coast of the northeast,

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:13.793
that is rich in fish, spices and has many different dishes.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:19.765
Those are also different from the gastronomy from Bahia,

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:23.216
which is the afrobrazilian gastronomy

00:03:23.216 --> 00:03:29.213
Then you have the "gaúcha" cuisine, from Rio Grande do Sul and part of Santa Catarina

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:32.635
but it is present mainly in Rio Grande do Sul. Many people think it's only about barbecue and

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:39.565
this is not true, we also have a lot of seafood and fish.
There is also a gastronomy from the midwest,

00:03:39.565 --> 00:03:45.856
in which it's very common to eat fish and special things like "pequi".

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:53.290
It's also influenced by paraguaian people that live in Mato Grosso do Sul, so they also use corn

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.785
and products made with corn. Actually, all these cuisines have sub-regions.

00:03:59.785 --> 00:04:12.283
For example, in the midwest: in the North of Tocantins people eat milk of babaçu, that doesn't exist

00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:15.329
in many other places. It's only there

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.719
It's a specific gastronomy.

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:26.769
In Rio Grande do Norte, there is a region called Seridó, which is a very rich and old sub-region in agriculture

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:31.701
it also fits to be a specific gastronomy.

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:36.460
There is many sub-regions from those regions I talked about.
