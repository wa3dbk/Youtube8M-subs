00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.560 

hi<00:00:00.539> so<00:00:00.930> today<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.290> wanted<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.740> share<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.580> couple

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hi so today I wanted to share a couple

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi so today I wanted to share a couple
of<00:00:03.780> tips<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.170> teaching<00:00:04.380> intonation<00:00:05.270> now<00:00:06.270> I

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
of tips on teaching intonation now I

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.940 
of tips on teaching intonation now I
always<00:00:06.720> think<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.170> pronunciation

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
always think that the pronunciation

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.549 
always think that the pronunciation
system<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.639> like<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> vocabulary<00:00:09.570> system<00:00:10.230> and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
system is like a vocabulary system and

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.259 
system is like a vocabulary system and
like<00:00:10.740> our<00:00:10.920> grammar<00:00:11.130> system<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
like our grammar system in that it is a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.600 
like our grammar system in that it is a
way<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.540> conveying<00:00:13.170> meaning<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.130> that's

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
way of conveying meaning and that's

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.860 
way of conveying meaning and that's
something<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.240> think<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.570> often

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
something that I think is often

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.439 
something that I think is often
overlooked<00:00:16.350> there's<00:00:17.279> two<00:00:17.520> main<00:00:17.820> functions<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
overlooked there's two main functions to

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.460 
overlooked there's two main functions to
intonation<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:21.020> contrast<00:00:22.020> new

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
intonation one is to contrast new

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
intonation one is to contrast new
information<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.490> old<00:00:23.760> information<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> one

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
information with old information and one

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
information with old information and one
is<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.400> separate<00:00:26.789> thought<00:00:27.090> groups<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.930> for

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
is two separate thought groups so for

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
is two separate thought groups so for
example<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> say<00:00:29.160> follow<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.849> car<00:00:30.119> which

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
example if I say follow that car which

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
example if I say follow that car which
counter<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.009> blue<00:00:32.189> car<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.090> blue<00:00:33.270> tie<00:00:33.420> with

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
counter the blue car the blue tie with

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.360 
counter the blue car the blue tie with
the<00:00:33.630> bad<00:00:33.809> guy<00:00:34.050> unit<00:00:34.380> I'm<00:00:34.890> using<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the bad guy unit I'm using the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.799 
the bad guy unit I'm using the
intonation<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.940> stress<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.450> kind<00:00:36.690> of

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
intonation and stress to kind of

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
intonation and stress to kind of
contrast<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.860> new<00:00:38.010> information<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
contrast the new information with the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
contrast the new information with the
old<00:00:38.969> information<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.559> for<00:00:40.800> example

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
old information and then for example

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
old information and then for example
separating<00:00:41.610> folk<00:00:41.820> groups<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.329> say<00:00:42.570> Jane

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
separating folk groups if I say Jane

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
separating folk groups if I say Jane
said<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:44.399> dog<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> clever<00:00:45.120> Jane<00:00:46.079> said<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.500> took

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
said my dog is clever Jane said I took

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.299 
said my dog is clever Jane said I took
his<00:00:46.920> clever<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.420> say<00:00:48.629> Jane<00:00:49.230> said<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.070> dog

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
his clever or if I say Jane said my dog

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
his clever or if I say Jane said my dog
is<00:00:50.700> clever<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.989> mean<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> completely

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
is clever the mean is completely

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
is clever the mean is completely
different<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> little<00:00:53.640> weird<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
different it's also a little weird but

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
different it's also a little weird but
it's<00:00:54.329> completely<00:00:54.480> different<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.230> your

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it's completely different right your

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.770 
it's completely different right your
dogs<00:00:55.590> talking<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.910> I've<00:00:57.149> done<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.570> words

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
dogs talking but all I've done the words

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
dogs talking but all I've done the words
are<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.469> grammar<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.890> same<00:00:59.160> but

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
are the same the grammar is the same but

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
are the same the grammar is the same but
the<00:01:00.030> vocabulary<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> pronunciation

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the vocabulary the the pronunciation

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.500 
the vocabulary the the pronunciation
sorry<00:01:02.309> has<00:01:02.489> changed<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> changed<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sorry has changed and changed the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.410 
sorry has changed and changed the
meaning<00:01:04.519> now<00:01:05.519> another<00:01:05.790> thing<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
meaning now another thing I think is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000 
meaning now another thing I think is
really<00:01:06.450> interesting<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
really interesting is if you have

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
really interesting is if you have
students<00:01:08.400> whose<00:01:08.909> first<00:01:09.420> language<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> tonal

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
students whose first language is a tonal

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
students whose first language is a tonal
language<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.280> example<00:01:11.340> Chinese<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.390> Thai

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
language for example Chinese or Thai

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.200 
language for example Chinese or Thai
Vietnamese<00:01:14.060> when<00:01:15.060> their<00:01:16.130> each<00:01:17.130> word<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> tone

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
Vietnamese when their each word to tone

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.960 
Vietnamese when their each word to tone
carries<00:01:18.869> meaning<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.439> ma<00:01:19.650> ma<00:01:20.009> ma<00:01:20.070> ma<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
carries meaning like ma ma ma ma like

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
carries meaning like ma ma ma ma like
it's<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.270> different<00:01:21.509> meanings<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it's all different meanings because the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.649 
it's all different meanings because the
tone<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> different<00:01:23.340> systems<00:01:23.880> expect<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
tone is different systems expect that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.179 
tone is different systems expect that
that's<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.229> they<00:01:25.350> used<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.070> they

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that's what they used to so when they

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310 
that's what they used to so when they
learn<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> word<00:01:26.790> they're<00:01:27.600> automatically

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
learn a word they're automatically

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.649 
learn a word they're automatically
learning<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.159> memorizing<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.000> tone<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
learning or memorizing the tone of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.289 
learning or memorizing the tone of the
word<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.040> teach<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.579> word<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.119> usually

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
word when we teach a word we usually

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
word when we teach a word we usually
teach<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.900> falling<00:01:34.259> intonation<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
teach it with falling intonation it's a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.890 
teach it with falling intonation it's a
book<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:36.600> my<00:01:37.170> favorite<00:01:38.360> however<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.689> we

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
book it's my favorite however when we

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
book it's my favorite however when we
construct<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.650> words<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.100> sentences<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
construct those words in sentences the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.870 
construct those words in sentences the
intonation<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.420> change<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.579> very

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
intonation can change but it can be very

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
intonation can change but it can be very
confusing<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> student<00:01:46.110> who<00:01:46.350> has<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> tonal

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
confusing for a student who has a tonal

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
confusing for a student who has a tonal
language<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.520> they've<00:01:47.610> learned<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.180> book

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
language and they've learned that book

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170 
language and they've learned that book
always<00:01:49.350> has<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.860> falling<00:01:50.369> intonation<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.060> then

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
always has a falling intonation and then

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.550 
always has a falling intonation and then
suddenly<00:01:51.509> they're<00:01:51.720> hearing<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.170> rising

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
suddenly they're hearing it with rising

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
suddenly they're hearing it with rising
intonation<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.520> very<00:01:53.729> very

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
intonation and it can be very very

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
intonation and it can be very very
confusing<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> difficult<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.560> also

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
confusing and difficult for them also

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
confusing and difficult for them also
when<00:01:56.610> they're<00:01:56.790> using<00:01:57.060> their<00:01:57.329> pronunciation

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
when they're using their pronunciation

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
when they're using their pronunciation
they're<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.079> used<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.560> using<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.340> tone

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
they're so used to just using the tone

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
they're so used to just using the tone
that<00:01:59.759> they've<00:01:59.909> learned<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.649> something

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that they've learned so that's something

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.109 
that they've learned so that's something
that<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.430> really<00:02:02.579> interesting<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that I think is really interesting to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.760 
that I think is really interesting to
think<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> consider<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.500> your

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
think about and consider if your

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
think about and consider if your
students<00:02:05.189> first<00:02:05.909> language<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> tonal

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
students first language to the tonal

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
students first language to the tonal
language

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
language

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
language
so<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> couple<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.720> couple<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.140> things

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so a couple you know a couple of things

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.339 
so a couple you know a couple of things
to<00:02:10.440> keep<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> mind<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.790> uses<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
to keep in mind the the uses of

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.170 
to keep in mind the the uses of
intonation<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.590> our<00:02:13.739> language<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
intonation in our language and then the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.880 
intonation in our language and then the
differences<00:02:15.629> between<00:02:15.780> other<00:02:16.170> languages<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
differences between other languages and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.100 
differences between other languages and
how<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.760> affect<00:02:18.030> their<00:02:18.810> ability

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
how that can really affect their ability

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
how that can really affect their ability
to<00:02:19.500> apply<00:02:20.489> those<00:02:20.760> users<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.360> understand<00:02:22.019> them
