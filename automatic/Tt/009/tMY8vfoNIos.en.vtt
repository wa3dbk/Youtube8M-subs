they're<00:00:35.010> things<00:00:35.280> relating<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> brush

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
they're things relating to the brush

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.530 
they're things relating to the brush
tool<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:37.469> panning<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.399> documents<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
tool so I'm panning the documents and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
tool so I'm panning the documents and
that's<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> spacebar<00:00:40.579> I'm<00:00:41.579> switching

that's the spacebar I'm switching

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.380 
that's the spacebar I'm switching
between<00:00:42.239> brush<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.200> eraser<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:45.090> certainly

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
between brush and eraser and I certainly

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
between brush and eraser and I certainly
don't<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> go<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> menu<00:00:46.620> for

don't want to go back to the menu for

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.639 
don't want to go back to the menu for
that<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.390> two<00:00:48.570> hotkeys<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that so I have two hotkeys one to be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.540 
that so I have two hotkeys one to be
brush<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> switch<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> eraser

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
brush and want to switch back to eraser

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.920 
brush and want to switch back to eraser
with<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> brush<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.510> able<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
with the brush I like to be able to have

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.010 
with the brush I like to be able to have
a<00:00:54.960> small<00:00:55.530> diameter<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> large<00:00:56.579> diameter

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
a small diameter or a large diameter

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.069 
a small diameter or a large diameter
again<00:00:58.020> keyboard<00:00:58.500> shortcuts<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.600> also<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
again keyboard shortcuts I also like to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
again keyboard shortcuts I also like to
hotkey<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> color<00:01:01.980> picker<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> simple

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
hotkey the color picker it's a simple

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.789 
hotkey the color picker it's a simple
thing<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.379> makes<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> big<00:01:04.830> difference<00:01:05.510> and

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
thing but it makes a big difference and

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
thing but it makes a big difference and
beyond<00:01:07.799> simple<00:01:08.130> hotkeys<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.970> also<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
beyond simple hotkeys I also like to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620 
beyond simple hotkeys I also like to
have<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> few<00:01:10.229> actions<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.640> things<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.180> often

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have a few actions so things I do often

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530 
have a few actions so things I do often
are<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> new<00:01:13.950> layer<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.479> short

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
are make a new layer it's a very short

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
are make a new layer it's a very short
action<00:01:15.990> single<00:01:16.890> key<00:01:17.040> press<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> new

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
action single key press now I have a new

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
action single key press now I have a new
layer<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.759> nice<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.360> way

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
layer and that is very nice for the way

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.490 
layer and that is very nice for the way
I<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> paint<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.470> temp<00:01:22.830> layers<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:24.500> have

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I like to paint with temp layers I have

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
I like to paint with temp layers I have
another<00:01:25.710> action<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.280> gives<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> new

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
another action that gives me a new

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
another action that gives me a new
multiply<00:01:27.810> layer<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.340> actions<00:01:29.729> very

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
multiply layer so that actions very

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.780 
multiply layer so that actions very
short<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.390> well<00:01:30.570> make<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> new<00:01:31.560> layer<00:01:31.770> set<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
short as well make a new layer set the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
short as well make a new layer set the
layer<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> multiply<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> allows<00:01:34.860> me<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
layer to multiply and this allows me to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.319 
layer to multiply and this allows me to
glaze<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:39.680> also<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> third<00:01:41.220> button<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
glaze I also have a third button that is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.139 
glaze I also have a third button that is
merged<00:01:42.780> down<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> I've<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.670> set<00:01:45.000> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
merged down and I've actually set this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
merged down and I've actually set this
to<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> single<00:01:45.930> key<00:01:46.110> press<00:01:46.409> by<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:46.950> an<00:01:47.130> action

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to a single key press by using an action

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
to a single key press by using an action
but<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.119> could<00:01:48.270> set<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> standard

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but you could set it to a standard

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.080 
but you could set it to a standard
keyboard<00:01:49.320> shortcut<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.030> I've

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
keyboard shortcut if you like so I've

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
keyboard shortcut if you like so I've
got<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.479> shortcut<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.110> give<00:01:52.259> me<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> new<00:01:52.590> layer

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
got one shortcut to give me a new layer

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.880 
got one shortcut to give me a new layer
and<00:01:53.450> another<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.049> merge<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> down<00:01:55.680> onto

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and another one to merge that down onto

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
and another one to merge that down onto
my<00:01:56.100> stack<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.869> these<00:01:57.869> might<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
my stack and these might not be the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
all the time but for me these are the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.780 
all the time but for me these are the
keys<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> I'm<00:02:03.570> always<00:02:03.930> using<00:02:04.579> same<00:02:05.579> with

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
doing that so for me I'll put those

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.080 
doing that so for me I'll put those
keyboard<00:02:12.000> shortcuts<00:02:12.480> near<00:02:13.080> my<00:02:13.200> fingertips

keyboard shortcuts near my fingertips

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.540 
keyboard shortcuts near my fingertips
now<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.300> may<00:02:15.510> not<00:02:15.540> seem<00:02:16.280> revolutionary<00:02:17.280> or

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
now this may not seem revolutionary or

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.390 
now this may not seem revolutionary or
very<00:02:17.880> exciting<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.650> artists

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
very exciting but I know that artists

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.420 
very exciting but I know that artists
like<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.880> avoid<00:02:21.239> technical<00:02:21.989> stuff<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.590> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
like to avoid technical stuff and is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.100 
like to avoid technical stuff and is
really<00:02:23.580> nothing<00:02:23.880> very<00:02:24.060> exciting<00:02:24.239> sounding

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
really nothing very exciting sounding

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.130 
really nothing very exciting sounding
about<00:02:25.349> keyboard<00:02:25.920> shortcuts<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.989> have

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
them all the time you might as well take

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.640 
them all the time you might as well take
some<00:02:35.520> time<00:02:35.790> design<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> new<00:02:36.870> keyboard<00:02:37.319> layout

some time design a new keyboard layout

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.190 
some time design a new keyboard layout
and<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.910> involve<00:02:39.180> remapping<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
and this is gonna involve remapping the

keyboard shortcuts and you can find that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.220 
keyboard shortcuts and you can find that

in the Edit keyboard shortcuts menu but

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.350 
in the Edit keyboard shortcuts menu but

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.009 
sits you are going to love the new
layout<00:02:56.060> now<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.239> really<00:02:57.569> doesn't<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.989> much

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
layout now this really doesn't have much

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.890 
layout now this really doesn't have much
to<00:02:58.350> do<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.590> traditional<00:02:58.799> art<00:02:59.299> but<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to do with traditional art but it is a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.150 
to do with traditional art but it is a
surefire<00:03:01.650> way<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> improve<00:03:03.090> your<00:03:03.420> painting

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
surefire way to improve your painting

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.289 
surefire way to improve your painting
and<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.459> hard<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.700> explain<00:03:06.120> exactly

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
and it can be hard to explain exactly

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.110 
and it can be hard to explain exactly
why<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:08.100> something<00:03:08.340> about<00:03:08.430> removing

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
why this is but something about removing

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.650 
why this is but something about removing
the<00:03:09.530> technical<00:03:10.530> clutter<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:12.150> focusing

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the technical clutter and just focusing

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.050 
the technical clutter and just focusing
on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> painting<00:03:13.260> will<00:03:14.130> really<00:03:14.610> lighten<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
on the painting will really lighten the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.910 
on the painting will really lighten the
load<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.480> will<00:03:15.720> make<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.350> much<00:03:16.709> better
