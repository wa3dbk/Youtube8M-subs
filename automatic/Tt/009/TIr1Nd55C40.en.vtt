00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 with shoes and I'm going to wear this here

 shoes and a sanitary napkin 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.620
 you must be wondering how 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.410
 So everybody has that shoe that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.239
 also in your house but unfortunately 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 it hurts a foot 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.199
 It hurts bothers you and the feeling that you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 has what is stepping in then stones 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.750
 and then appears at a wedding party and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.489
 Do you want to wear that shoe exactly? 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 and then how do you then tip a quick and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.979
 has the solution there with certainty of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 You every girl has a pack of 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 absorber manages and every girl has a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 flat shoe that bothers I received this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.880
 many years ago from a friend who 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 she is beautiful horizon is the priscilla 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.200
 miserable in the clinic and said I did not like it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.799
 because the tip was toyo every year the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 credits and I never stopped using 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.600
 This trick then every time I 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.329
 I have a fact that bothers me turn to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.820
 stroke that gives supercerts and solves the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.700
 problem in time then this is an example 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.799
 of a shoe that I love I love more 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.159
 unfortunately it bothers 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.869
 and then we do I'll show 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.850
 you already ready 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.790
 this is also another shoe that I 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.460
 love but it bothers and then I make a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.700
 camera 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.280
 very comfortable girls is like it was 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.010
 an insole with which media made 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.050
 with sanitary napkin 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.690
 so you will buy those in the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.490
 Even cockroaches do not need to be thick 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.100
 Okay, it can be thick like that. 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.690
 average thin crust not so thin because 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.220
 also will not solve the problem but 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.930
 a more or less n-mean thickness 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.500
 and it does not have to be that big either 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.980
 It was as it is to wear a shoe 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.580
 but anyway you will accommodate the absorbent 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.580
 here inside the shoe is mainly 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.850
 you will accommodate in the part that most 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.209
 hurts that in case it would be my case 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.200
 here the sole of the foot in this region 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.989
 and then you will accommodate it here and there 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.180
 wear your shoes normally only with 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.650
 a difference now you're not going anymore 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.030
 have that feeling that you are 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.370
 stepping on stones 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.970
 You will feel a very cute little walk. 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.489
 and super comfortable and the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.970
 problem then is a simple quick tip 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 and that it's easy there for sure. 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.570
 I do not know and did not know if you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.940
 I was the video you have liked to 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.110
 help in sharing share speech 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.970
 for the friends 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.560
 I'm sure it 's a tip like that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.510
 everybody will always adore me 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.120
 I share this and it's very successful. 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.790
 because it's a way I said it fast 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.989
 cheap and you solve your problem 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.910
 quickly 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.280
 at least at first it is not 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.470
 logical that there are specific insoles 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.660
 nor 11 orthopedic products 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 but if you do not want to spend you do not want 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.170
 invest in this type of product and you 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.230
 this quick fix 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.750
 just use a cheap absorbent and the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.880
 Your shoe will become beautiful so it is 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.880
 This, girls, kiss, bye
