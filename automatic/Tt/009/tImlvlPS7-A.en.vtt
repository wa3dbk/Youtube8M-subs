in this helix kind of pattern I'll swirl

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.780 
in this helix kind of pattern I'll swirl
together<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.540> suspended<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.229> gel<00:01:26.570> and

together and it's suspended in a gel and

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
together and it's suspended in a gel and
both<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> these<00:01:30.060> products<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
both of these products are one out so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.270 
both of these products are one out so
you're<00:01:31.409> getting<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> same<00:01:31.890> amount<00:01:31.920> of

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
just going to pump one for now basically

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.820 
just going to pump one for now basically
what<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:51.910> does<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.540> as<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.930> pumps<00:04:53.169> through<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
what it does is as it pumps through the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.580 
what it does is as it pumps through the
pearls<00:04:54.190> break<00:04:54.610> open<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.750> girl<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.110> powder

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
is inside of these pearls and i think

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.940 
is inside of these pearls and i think
that<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.130> reason<00:05:03.160> why<00:05:03.960> these<00:05:04.960> keep<00:05:05.440> your<00:05:05.680> face

that the reason why these keep your face
more<00:05:06.310> modified<00:05:06.820> during<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.300> day<00:05:07.450> is<00:05:07.750> because

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
more modified during the day is because

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.590 
more modified during the day is because
of<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.740> powder<00:05:08.980> in<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.430> product<00:05:09.880> both<00:05:10.390> of

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
of the powder in the product both of

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.700 
of the powder in the product both of
them<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> this<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.570> can<00:05:13.690> kind<00:05:13.930> of<00:05:13.990> see<00:05:14.050> but

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
them so this you can kind of see but

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.420 
them so this you can kind of see but
this<00:05:15.010> also<00:05:15.340> dries<00:05:15.850> down<00:05:16.150> really<00:05:16.540> quick<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:18.400> you

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
this also dries down really quick so you

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.150 
this also dries down really quick so you
put<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.300> putting<00:05:20.260> a<00:05:20.380> lot<00:05:20.560> in<00:05:20.710> one<00:05:20.860> area

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
put it on and putting a lot in one area

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.830 
put it on and putting a lot in one area
so<00:05:21.460> it's<00:05:21.610> going<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:21.760> take<00:05:21.850> longer<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.690> dry

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
so it's going to take longer to dry

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.770 
so it's going to take longer to dry
again<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.979> doesn't<00:05:24.520> leave<00:05:24.729> your<00:05:24.850> face<00:05:25.120> sparkly
