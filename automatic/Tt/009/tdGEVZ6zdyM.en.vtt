00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
bottom siphon right there when that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.540 
bottom siphon right there when that
siphon<00:02:06.630> starts<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.080> overflow<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.770> creates<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
siphon starts to overflow it creates a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.089 
siphon starts to overflow it creates a
big<00:02:08.789> suction<00:02:09.330> kind<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.019> like<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.349> trusty

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
big suction kind of like my trusty

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
big suction kind of like my trusty
plunger<00:02:11.519> right<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.060> call<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> Shalin

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
plunger right here I call a Shalin

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.839 
plunger right here I call a Shalin
you<00:02:13.409> see<00:02:13.590> when<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.739> use<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:13.980> plunger<00:02:14.400> I'm

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
you see when I use my plunger I'm

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.580 
you see when I use my plunger I'm
sucking<00:02:15.390> up<00:02:15.510> water<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.170> pulling<00:02:16.440> it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
sucking up water like that pulling it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.140 
sucking up water like that pulling it
from<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.890> place<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.159> another<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
from one place to another when that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.940 
from one place to another when that
siphon<00:02:18.569> overflows<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.050> same<00:02:19.409> kind<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.739> thing

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
siphon overflows the same kind of thing

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.190 
siphon overflows the same kind of thing
happens<00:02:20.370> gravity<00:02:21.090> pulls<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.480> down<00:02:21.510> creates<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
happens gravity pulls it down creates a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.320 
happens gravity pulls it down creates a
suction<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.069> suction<00:02:23.400> pulls<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:24.030> water

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
suction that suction pulls more water

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.270 
suction that suction pulls more water

that's<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.090> giant<00:02:39.300> siphon<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:40.500> right<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.740> can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that's a giant siphon all right you can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.440 
that's a giant siphon all right you can
tell<00:02:41.069> everyone<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:41.640> we<00:02:41.910> want<00:02:42.060> people<00:02:42.240> to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
tell everyone actually we want people to

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.120 
tell everyone actually we want people to
know<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.110> when<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.380> thing<00:02:43.650> fills<00:02:43.920> up

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
know that so when that thing fills up

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.190 
know that so when that thing fills up
same<00:02:44.610> thing<00:02:44.640> happens<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.540> those<00:02:45.720> hyphens

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
same thing happens is on those hyphens

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.930 
same thing happens is on those hyphens
the<00:02:46.470> whole<00:02:46.680> thing<00:02:46.980> fills<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.430> at<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> end<00:02:47.819> of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the whole thing fills up at the end of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510 
the whole thing fills up at the end of
the<00:02:48.000> hour<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.480> overflows<00:02:49.200> water<00:02:49.830> drains<00:02:50.220> down

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
the hour it overflows water drains down

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.000 
the hour it overflows water drains down
by<00:02:50.730> gravity<00:02:51.270> another<00:02:51.870> suction<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.500> created

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
by gravity another suction is created

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.740 
by gravity another suction is created
sucking<00:02:53.550> more<00:02:53.730> water<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.360> top<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.569> the

sucking more water out of the top of the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
sucking more water out of the top of the
clock<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.170> dump<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.770> over<00:02:55.980> into<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
clock and dump it in over into the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.000 
clock and dump it in over into the
outside<00:02:56.760> see<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.480> outside<00:02:57.800> one<00:02:58.800> through

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
outside see that outside one through

three<00:02:59.160> all<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.550> up<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.760> 12<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.780> what

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
three all the way up to 12 that's what

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.840 
three all the way up to 12 that's what
they<00:03:01.050> call<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.350> outside<00:03:01.950> right<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.610> that's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
they call the outside right and that's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.910 
they call the outside right and that's
another<00:03:03.120> siphon<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.260> whole<00:03:04.410> thing<00:03:04.650> fills
