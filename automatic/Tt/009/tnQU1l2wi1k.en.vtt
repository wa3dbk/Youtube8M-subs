00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.789 

a<00:00:03.799> lifting<00:00:04.799> column<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.690> one<00:00:06.690> package<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.589> has

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
a lifting column is one package that has

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.549 
a lifting column is one package that has
both<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.610> lifting<00:00:09.000> mechanism<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.719> bearing

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
both a lifting mechanism and bearing

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.520 
both a lifting mechanism and bearing
supports<00:00:10.980> built<00:00:11.880> into<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
supports built into one so you have a

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470 
supports built into one so you have a
lifting<00:00:14.370> mechanism<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> actuator

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
lifting mechanism with the actuator

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000 
lifting mechanism with the actuator
inside<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.500> also<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.830> have

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
inside of it then also you have

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.340 
inside of it then also you have
telescoping<00:00:17.730> aluminum<00:00:18.210> extrusions<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
telescoping aluminum extrusions and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
telescoping aluminum extrusions and
between<00:00:19.560> those<00:00:19.770> extrusions<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.990> engineered

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
between those extrusions are engineered

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
between those extrusions are engineered
polymer<00:00:22.439> bushings<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.760> provide<00:00:24.090> moment

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
polymer bushings which provide moment

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.870 
polymer bushings which provide moment
load<00:00:24.539> support<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.710> package<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.670> have

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
load support so in one package you have

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
load support so in one package you have
both<00:00:27.090> your<00:00:27.150> lift<00:00:27.570> mechanism<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.220> moment

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
both your lift mechanism and your moment

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.209 
both your lift mechanism and your moment
load<00:00:29.609> support<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.359> side<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.660> side<00:00:31.219> you'll

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
load support from side to side you'll

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.470 
load support from side to side you'll
see<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> two<00:00:32.910> different<00:00:33.120> areas

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
see these things in two different areas

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
see these things in two different areas
one<00:00:33.750> would<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.530> medical<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> can

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
one would be for medical use so you can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
one would be for medical use so you can
see<00:00:36.120> them<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:37.340> medical<00:00:38.340> bed<00:00:38.510> an<00:00:39.510> x-ray<00:00:39.899> table

workstation<00:00:48.020> anything<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.170> might

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
workstation anything where you might

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
workstation anything where you might
have<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.770> different<00:00:50.160> assembly<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.329> require

have some different assembly or require
some<00:00:52.590> adjustable<00:00:53.070> lift<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.660> ergonomic

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
some adjustable lift so in ergonomic

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
some adjustable lift so in ergonomic
applications<00:00:55.770> what's<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.730> about

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
applications what's really good about

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
applications what's really good about
these<00:00:57.090> lifting<00:00:57.420> columns<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> their<00:00:58.109> extension

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
these lifting columns is their extension

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.880 
these lifting columns is their extension
to<00:00:58.739> retraction<00:00:59.219> ratio<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to retraction ratio so you can with the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
to retraction ratio so you can with the
telescoping<00:01:02.780> extrusions<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> telescoping

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
telescoping extrusions and telescoping

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
telescoping extrusions and telescoping
actuator<00:01:04.949> inside<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> unit<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.510> very

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
actuator inside the unit you can go very

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.890 
actuator inside the unit you can go very
low<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.710> extend<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.280> high<00:01:08.750> inside<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
low and then extend very high inside the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
low and then extend very high inside the
actuator<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.340> call<00:01:11.369> internal<00:01:12.090> limit

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
actuator are what we call internal limit

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
actuator are what we call internal limit
switches<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:13.470> limit<00:01:13.740> switches<00:01:13.950> are

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
switches so these limit switches are

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
switches so these limit switches are
wired<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.270> series<00:01:15.299> through<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> motor<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
wired in series through the motor so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
wired in series through the motor so
when<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> actuator<00:01:17.130> hits<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> end<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.290> stroke

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
when the actuator hits the end of stroke

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
when the actuator hits the end of stroke
it<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.040> automatically<00:01:20.490> turn<00:01:20.729> itself<00:01:20.790> off<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it will automatically turn itself off it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
it will automatically turn itself off it
won't<00:01:21.570> let<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.900> any<00:01:22.710> farther<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
won't let you go any farther and it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.190 
won't let you go any farther and it
won't<00:01:24.060> cause<00:01:24.240> any<00:01:24.270> damage<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.799> motor<00:01:26.070> or

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
won't cause any damage to the motor or

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
won't cause any damage to the motor or
the<00:01:28.200> outside<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> unit<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.100> anything<00:01:29.400> like

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the outside of the unit or anything like

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.109 
the outside of the unit or anything like
that<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> Thompson<00:01:30.750> advantage<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
that so the Thompson advantage is the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
that so the Thompson advantage is the
extension<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.299> retraction<00:01:33.750> ratio<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.710> mobile

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
extension to retraction ratio the mobile

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
extension to retraction ratio the mobile
load<00:01:35.130> capability<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> ideal

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
load capability and then the ideal

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.050 
load capability and then the ideal
combination<00:01:37.070> noise<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> speed

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
customers need them we had some

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
customers need them we had some
makeshift<00:02:01.500> cards<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.400> were<00:02:02.610> fixed<00:02:03.570> height

makeshift cards that were fixed height

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560 
makeshift cards that were fixed height
so<00:02:04.290> they<00:02:04.560> weren't<00:02:04.770> very<00:02:05.100> adjustable<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.390> main

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
so they weren't very adjustable the main

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
so they weren't very adjustable the main
reason<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.020> needed<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> lifting<00:02:07.800> column<00:02:08.130> was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
reason we needed the lifting column was

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.900 
reason we needed the lifting column was
we<00:02:08.729> had<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> Kaizen<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:10.910> incorporated

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
we had a Kaizen that incorporated

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.000 
we had a Kaizen that incorporated
several<00:02:12.570> products<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.290> one<00:02:13.440> line<00:02:13.650> what<00:02:13.860> we

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
several products to one line what we

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.690 
several products to one line what we
term<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> mixed<00:02:15.060> model<00:02:15.360> cell<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
term here is a mixed model cell the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.250 
term here is a mixed model cell the
other<00:02:17.730> problem<00:02:18.270> we<00:02:18.390> had<00:02:18.570> was<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.080> have

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
other problem we had was we have

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.860 
other problem we had was we have
different<00:02:19.770> size<00:02:20.430> operators<00:02:21.209> obviously<00:02:21.660> some

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
different size operators obviously some

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.290 
different size operators obviously some
tall<00:02:22.080> people<00:02:22.110> some<00:02:22.830> short<00:02:23.100> people<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.090> had

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
tall people some short people so we had

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.100 
tall people some short people so we had
to<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.630> an<00:02:24.840> assembly<00:02:25.790> mechanism<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
to have an assembly mechanism to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.900 
to have an assembly mechanism to
accommodate<00:02:28.110> all<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.580> knew<00:02:29.760> we

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
accommodate all of that we we knew we

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910 
accommodate all of that we we knew we
needed<00:02:30.090> an<00:02:30.450> adjustable<00:02:31.020> height<00:02:31.170> system

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
needed an adjustable height system

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
needed an adjustable height system
something<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.550> would<00:02:32.760> accommodate<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
something that would accommodate the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.770 
something that would accommodate the
various<00:02:33.900> products<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.920> various<00:02:35.250> people

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
various products and the various people

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.140 
various products and the various people
every<00:02:36.780> time<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.050> lift<00:02:37.260> their<00:02:37.380> product<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.830> risk

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
every time we lift their product we risk

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
every time we lift their product we risk
injury<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.360> people<00:02:39.690> because<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.440> aren't

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
injury to people because these aren't

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.810 
injury to people because these aren't
light<00:02:40.950> pieces<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.209> equipment<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
light pieces of equipment and it just it

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.640 
light pieces of equipment and it just it
saves<00:02:45.120> time<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> gives<00:02:45.989> us<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.230> better<00:02:46.380> product

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
saves time and gives us a better product

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
saves time and gives us a better product
in<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> end<00:02:47.100> because<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.300> nature<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
in the end because of the the nature of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.240 
in the end because of the the nature of
the<00:02:48.780> cart<00:02:48.989> we<00:02:49.140> were<00:02:49.260> able<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.620> adjust<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.130> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the cart we were able to adjust it it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.310 
the cart we were able to adjust it it
helps<00:02:50.489> us<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.910> tests<00:02:51.180> something<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.230> we

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
helps us in tests something that we

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.050 
helps us in tests something that we
didn't<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.590> before<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:53.610> does<00:02:53.760> everything

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
didn't have before it does everything

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.270 
didn't have before it does everything
they<00:02:54.300> need<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.570> do<00:02:54.799> operators<00:02:55.799> before

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
they need to do operators before

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280 
they need to do operators before
sometimes<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.269> would<00:02:57.390> sit<00:02:57.630> sometimes<00:02:58.140> they

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
sometimes they would sit sometimes they

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.960 
sometimes they would sit sometimes they
would<00:02:58.410> stand<00:02:58.739> depending<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> carts<00:02:59.610> today

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
would stand depending on the carts today

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
would stand depending on the carts today
with<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.390> cart<00:03:00.570> being<00:03:00.780> adjustable<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.500> can

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
with the cart being adjustable they can

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
with the cart being adjustable they can
do<00:03:01.769> either<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.370> there's<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:03.000> complaints

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
do either that there's no complaints

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.539 
do either that there's no complaints
that<00:03:03.630> way<00:03:03.750> parts<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.830> normally<00:03:05.310> would

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
that way parts that we normally would

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.030 
that way parts that we normally would
have<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.150> put<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> rack<00:03:07.200> beside<00:03:07.620> them<00:03:07.830> now

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
have to put on a rack beside them now

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
have to put on a rack beside them now
travel<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.640> cart<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.390> makes<00:03:09.600> things

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
travel on the cart so that makes things

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.050 
travel on the cart so that makes things
a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.049> easier<00:03:10.110> everybody<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:11.730> loves<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
a lot easier everybody just loves the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.789 
a lot easier everybody just loves the
cars

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.050 

so<00:03:16.799> we're<00:03:16.950> excited<00:03:17.159> about<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> solutions

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
so we're excited about the solutions

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.059 
so we're excited about the solutions
that<00:03:18.209> were<00:03:18.390> we're<00:03:18.780> bringing<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.140> videojet<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
that were we're bringing to videojet you

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.140 
that were we're bringing to videojet you
can<00:03:20.220> see<00:03:20.370> what<00:03:20.489> they<00:03:20.579> were<00:03:20.640> doing<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.030> there

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
can see what they were doing out there

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.520 
can see what they were doing out there
before<00:03:21.540> we've<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.140> made<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.319> lot<00:03:22.500> of

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
before we've really made a lot of

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.830 
before we've really made a lot of
improvements<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.939> Tars<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.540> far<00:03:24.750> as

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
improvements and Tars as far as

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.390 
improvements and Tars as far as
throughput<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.650> feedback<00:03:25.829> we're<00:03:26.099> getting<00:03:26.129> is

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
throughput the feedback we're getting is

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.069 
throughput the feedback we're getting is
that<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.700> Thompson<00:03:27.269> lifting<00:03:27.540> counts<00:03:27.900> are

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that the Thompson lifting counts are

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.670 
that the Thompson lifting counts are
very<00:03:28.680> easy<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.040> install<00:03:30.079> there's<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.140> simple<00:03:31.470> 4

is make it very easy to operate and
integrate<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.329> their<00:03:39.360> machine<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.890> they're

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
integrate into their machine and they're

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.800 
integrate into their machine and they're
very<00:03:41.250> pleased<00:03:41.640> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.269> extension<00:03:42.569> to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
very pleased with the extension to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.720 
very pleased with the extension to
retraction<00:03:43.290> ratio<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.129> combination<00:03:44.700> of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
retraction ratio and the combination of

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.080 
retraction ratio and the combination of
noise<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.900> speed<00:03:46.319> ticket<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
noise and speed ticket so this is the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.240 
noise and speed ticket so this is the
mechanical<00:03:48.299> portion<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.109> actuator<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.129> we

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
mechanical portion of the actuator so we

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.550 
mechanical portion of the actuator so we
have<00:03:50.370> here<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.640> tube<00:03:51.000> which<00:03:51.659> holds<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.140> 25

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
have here a tube which holds this 25

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.979 
have here a tube which holds this 25
millimeter<00:03:52.980> diameter<00:03:53.430> lead<00:03:53.909> screw<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.629> then

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
millimeter diameter lead screw and then

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
millimeter diameter lead screw and then
what<00:03:55.109> gives<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.680> unit<00:03:56.400> its<00:03:56.579> extensions

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
what gives it the unit its extensions

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.729 
what gives it the unit its extensions
retraction<00:03:57.540> ratio<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.049> we<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.440> extra

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
retraction ratio is we have this extra

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.059 
retraction ratio is we have this extra
12<00:03:59.609> millimeter<00:04:00.000> lead<00:04:00.209> screw<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:01.500> telescopes

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
12 millimeter lead screw the telescopes

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.369 
12 millimeter lead screw the telescopes
into<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.269> what<00:04:03.389> gives<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
into that so that's what gives it the

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.080 
into that so that's what gives it the
ideal<00:04:04.829> extension<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> retraction<00:04:05.819> ratio

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.670 
inside the unit now at the bottom of the
tube<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.909> have<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.389> wrap<00:04:09.870> spring<00:04:10.170> break<00:04:10.440> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
tube we have the wrap spring break and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.649 
tube we have the wrap spring break and
this<00:04:11.159> will<00:04:11.310> hold<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.670> load<00:04:11.849> in<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.239> power<00:04:12.450> off

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
this will hold the load in a power off

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.349 
this will hold the load in a power off
situation<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.859> if<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.069> power<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.370> off<00:04:14.639> the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
situation so if the power is off the

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.900 
situation so if the power is off the
workstation<00:04:16.289> or<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.919> medical<00:04:17.370> table<00:04:17.609> bed<00:04:17.760> is

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
workstation or the medical table bed is

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
workstation or the medical table bed is
going<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.150> hold<00:04:18.359> its<00:04:18.570> position<00:04:18.630> then<00:04:19.320> down

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
going to hold its position then down

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.279 
going to hold its position then down
here<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.070> gearing<00:04:20.970> for<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.510> belt<00:04:21.930> gearing

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
here is the gearing for the belt gearing

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.350 
here is the gearing for the belt gearing
that<00:04:22.740> goes<00:04:22.919> into<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.280> motor<00:04:23.490> that's<00:04:24.210> what

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
that goes into the motor that's what

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510 
that goes into the motor that's what
actually<00:04:24.599> drive<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.930> actually

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
actually drive you actually

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.740 
actually drive you actually
so<00:04:27.520> what<00:04:27.639> we<00:04:27.729> have<00:04:27.879> here<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.180> sample<00:04:28.569> desk

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
so what we have here is a sample desk

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.559 
so what we have here is a sample desk
lift<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.440> uses<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:30.009> LC<00:04:30.520> 1600<00:04:31.210> lifting

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569

encoders<00:04:36.669> on<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:37.150> motor<00:04:37.349> so<00:04:38.349> once<00:04:39.009> they're

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
encoders on the motor so once they're

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.550 
encoders on the motor so once they're
installed<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.240> use<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.509> Thompson<00:04:41.169> dcg

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
installed you can use a Thompson dcg

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.680 
installed you can use a Thompson dcg
controller<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:43.030> sync<00:04:43.240> them<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:43.539> that's

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
controller to sync them and that's

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.140 
controller to sync them and that's
already<00:04:43.900> pre-programmed<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.550> very<00:04:45.940> easy

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
already pre-programmed so it's very easy

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.390 
already pre-programmed so it's very easy
to<00:04:46.270> have<00:04:46.509> these<00:04:46.629> think<00:04:46.870> together<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:48.280> we're

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
to have these think together so we're

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.700 
to have these think together so we're
looking<00:04:48.580> at<00:04:48.669> two<00:04:48.699> 5-gallon<00:04:49.539> jugs<00:04:50.259> of<00:04:50.379> water<00:04:50.500> on
