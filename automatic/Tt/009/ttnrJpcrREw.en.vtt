infrastructure on all levels is so
difficult<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:38.309> improbable<00:00:40.520> it's<00:00:41.520> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
difficult and improbable it's just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.360

it's<00:00:44.370> Eureka<00:00:45.710> interest<00:00:46.710> sensor<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.190> were

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
it's Eureka interest sensor they were

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
it's Eureka interest sensor they were
either<00:00:48.539> find<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> or<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.530> done<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.850> got

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
either find it or you done then it's got

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389

just after while you're accepting it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.420 
just after while you're accepting it
there<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.140> reasons<00:01:13.500> why<00:01:13.650> people<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:14.189> drawn

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there are reasons why people are drawn

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.870 
there are reasons why people are drawn
here<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:16.340> how<00:01:17.340> beautiful

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
here that have to do with how beautiful

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
here that have to do with how beautiful
it<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:19.950> reasons<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it is and then there are reasons that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.960 
it is and then there are reasons that
people<00:01:20.580> stay<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.820> how

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
people stay here that have to do it how

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
people stay here that have to do it how
supportive<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.040> those<00:01:26.040> creative<00:01:26.700> people

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
supportive it is those creative people

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.630 
supportive it is those creative people
that's<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> interesting

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
that's what makes it interesting

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.800 
that's what makes it interesting
basically<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> artists<00:01:30.689> who

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
basically I think it's the artists who

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
basically I think it's the artists who
reflect<00:01:31.259> who<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.280> every<00:01:32.579> society<00:01:34.909> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
reflect who we are in every society you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 
reflect who we are in every society you
can't<00:01:36.180> say<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.810> arts<00:01:37.110> should<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.829> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can't say the arts should do this it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
can't say the arts should do this it's
just<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:39.210> pushes<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.930> artists<00:01:40.259> pushes<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
just it pushes the artists pushes the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
just it pushes the artists pushes the
rules<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> really<00:01:42.630> good
