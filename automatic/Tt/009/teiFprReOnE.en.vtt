00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
soon as you've noticed it basically

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
pulls out the back here some of the some

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.710 
pulls out the back here some of the some
of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.090> problems<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.180> I've<00:02:14.299> had<00:02:14.329> with<00:02:14.660> this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
of the problems that I've had with this

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.490 
of the problems that I've had with this
brush<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.349> tip<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.760> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
brush is the tip here is a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.230 
brush is the tip here is a
is<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.950> needle<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.490> protected<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.180> you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
is the needle is not protected so you

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.750 
is the needle is not protected so you
can<00:02:19.510> prick<00:02:19.720> yourself<00:02:19.840> pretty<00:02:20.290> bad<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.980> but

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
can prick yourself pretty bad on it but

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.550 
can prick yourself pretty bad on it but
also<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.150> easier<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.570> damage<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
also it's easier to damage the the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.210 
also it's easier to damage the the
needle<00:02:24.090> also<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:26.410> thing<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.800> experienced

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
needle also one thing I have experienced

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.560 
needle also one thing I have experienced
has<00:02:27.310> been<00:02:27.460> holding<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.060> this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
has been holding it like this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.370 
has been holding it like this
your<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.520> needle<00:02:31.240> truck<00:02:31.420> gets<00:02:31.630> caught<00:02:32.350> on

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
your the the needle truck gets caught on

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.620 
your the the needle truck gets caught on
your<00:02:32.620> hand<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.730> basically<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.450> kind<00:02:34.600> of

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
your hand so basically I just kind of

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.020

turned<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.580> arrests<00:02:36.880> like

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
turned it like that so the arrests like

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.810 
turned it like that so the arrests like
that<00:02:37.410> other<00:02:38.410> than<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.040> very<00:02:39.340> very

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
that other than that it's a very very

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.570 
that other than that it's a very very
simple<00:02:40.060> brush<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.950> use<00:02:42.959> good<00:02:43.959> for<00:02:44.580> fairly

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
coverage I bought it off of a man off of

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.130 
coverage I bought it off of a man off of
a<00:02:52.989> website<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.680> contained<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:55.090> brush<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
a website that contained the brush the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.880 
a website that contained the brush the
cap<00:02:56.380> as<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.620> see<00:02:56.920> here<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.930> paint<00:02:59.230> cups<00:02:59.500> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
cap as you see here a to paint cups and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
cap as you see here a to paint cups and
an<00:03:00.430> abraded<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.750> believe<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.470> 4-foot<00:03:02.980> line

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
an abraded I believe it's a 4-foot line

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.420 
an abraded I believe it's a 4-foot line
for<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.690> good<00:03:04.840> price<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.260> about<00:03:05.500> 80<00:03:05.739> $80

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
for a really good price of about 80 $80

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.240
