00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
alright here's my bottle washer I made

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.130 
alright here's my bottle washer I made
at<00:00:03.750> work<00:00:03.959> with<00:00:04.290> our<00:00:04.500> CNC<00:00:05.009> machine<00:00:05.930> this<00:00:06.930> is

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
at work with our CNC machine this is

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.299 
at work with our CNC machine this is
made<00:00:07.319> out<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:08.120> foam<00:00:09.120> 2<00:00:09.420> PVC<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.230> think<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> brand

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
made out of foam 2 PVC I think the brand

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.499 
made out of foam 2 PVC I think the brand
name<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.580> sin<00:00:11.940> Cara<00:00:12.090> or<00:00:12.389> coma<00:00:12.660> Tex

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
name is sin Cara or coma Tex

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.150 
name is sin Cara or coma Tex
it's<00:00:15.509> basically<00:00:16.220> two<00:00:17.220> layers<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:19.039> here<00:00:20.039> on

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
it's basically two layers and here on

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.820 
it's basically two layers and here on
the<00:00:20.250> bottom<00:00:20.400> layer<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:20.880> four<00:00:21.270> pipes

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
the bottom layer we have four pipes

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.380 
the bottom layer we have four pipes
running<00:00:22.830> through<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> other<00:00:23.640> side<00:00:23.789> each

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
running through to the other side each

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.870 
running through to the other side each
with<00:00:24.630> four<00:00:24.900> spouts<00:00:28.039> then<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.189> turn<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.670> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
with four spouts then we turn them in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.360 
with four spouts then we turn them in
Inlet<00:00:31.009> just<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.309> on/off<00:00:32.759> switch

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.639 

basically<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.730> place<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.180> bottle<00:00:39.540> rest<00:00:40.469> an

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
basically you place your bottle rest an

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.760 
basically you place your bottle rest an
upper<00:00:40.950> hole<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> neck<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> rest<00:00:43.260> inside

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
upper hole on the neck the rest inside

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.660 
upper hole on the neck the rest inside
the<00:00:43.980> lower<00:00:44.160> hole<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.200> C<00:00:46.890> PVC

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the lower hole and these are C PVC

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
the lower hole and these are C PVC
tubing<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.860> quarter-inch<00:00:50.660> with<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
tubing I think it's quarter-inch with a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
tubing I think it's quarter-inch with a
little<00:00:52.079> drip<00:00:52.590> irrigation<00:00:53.989> splice<00:00:54.989> adapter<00:00:55.590> on

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
little drip irrigation splice adapter on

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.500 
little drip irrigation splice adapter on
each<00:00:56.789> tip<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.379> new<00:01:01.620> openings<00:01:02.180> are<00:01:03.180> made

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
each tip and the new openings are made

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
each tip and the new openings are made
for<00:01:04.580> punku<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> farmers<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> holds<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
for punku and farmers so holds it just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
for punku and farmers so holds it just
above<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> spout<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> water<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.080> drain

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
above the spout so the water can drain

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.700 
above the spout so the water can drain
back<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.990> made<00:01:22.140> an<00:01:22.259> insert<00:01:22.680> for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
back out and I made an insert for

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.100 
back out and I made an insert for
smaller<00:01:23.220> bottles<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.330> shaking

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
smaller bottles you know on them shaking

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.819 
smaller bottles you know on them shaking
around<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> slides<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:28.290> these<00:01:28.409> tabs

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
around it just slides on to these tabs

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.390 
around it just slides on to these tabs
right<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> must<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
right here and then this must be the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
right here and then this must be the
skinny<00:01:32.700> one

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 

but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.979> need<00:01:41.190> them<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> thought

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
but I don't really need them I thought

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.700 
but I don't really need them I thought
oh<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> rattle<00:01:43.350> around<00:01:43.409> too

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
oh and I want them to rattle around too

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.850 
oh and I want them to rattle around too
much<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:48.020> I'll<00:01:49.020> hold<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.440> relatively

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
much but I'll hold them relatively

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.620 
much but I'll hold them relatively
upright<00:01:52.909> before<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.940> might<00:01:54.119> hold<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.450> they

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
upright before I might hold one they

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.700 
upright before I might hold one they
would<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.900> tilt<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.410> side

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
would all tilt to the side

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.760 
would all tilt to the side
they<00:01:56.070> were<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.369> supported<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> spout

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
they were just supported on the spout

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.180 
they were just supported on the spout
let's<00:01:58.770> turn<00:01:59.130> a<00:02:03.650> t-square<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.800> all<00:02:04.860> over<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
let's turn a t-square it all over the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.020 
let's turn a t-square it all over the
place<00:02:05.400> but<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.880> make

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
place but you can see that you make

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.580 
place but you can see that you make
plenty<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.450> pressure<00:02:09.750> you're<00:02:10.259> washing

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
plenty of pressure you're washing

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
plenty of pressure you're washing
bottles<00:02:12.680> that's<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:13.980> sad<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.000> tough

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
bottles that's just sad that's tough

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.340 
bottles that's just sad that's tough
there's<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:17.510> sump<00:02:18.510> pump<00:02:18.570> or<00:02:18.989> whatever<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.320> call

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
there's a sump pump or whatever we call

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.259 
there's a sump pump or whatever we call
it<00:02:20.630> drink<00:02:21.630> blood<00:02:22.230> pump<00:02:22.610> let's<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.910> hooked<00:02:24.090> up

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
it drink blood pump let's just hooked up

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.759 
it drink blood pump let's just hooked up
I<00:02:24.450> think<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:24.900> 600<00:02:25.800> gallons<00:02:26.280> per<00:02:26.640> hour<00:02:27.769> it's

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
I think it's 600 gallons per hour it's

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.509 
I think it's 600 gallons per hour it's
pretty<00:02:28.980> styling<00:02:29.340> cutting<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> hose

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
pretty styling cutting it up to the hose

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.400 
pretty styling cutting it up to the hose
without<00:02:32.519> those<00:02:32.910> nozzles<00:02:33.150> though<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.140> water

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
without those nozzles though that water

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.259 
without those nozzles though that water
stream<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.890> maybe<00:02:35.160> only<00:02:35.250> two<00:02:35.670> or<00:02:35.700> three<00:02:35.970> inches

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
stream is maybe only two or three inches

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.750 
stream is maybe only two or three inches
colleges<00:02:36.840> pretty<00:02:37.650> interesting<00:02:38.070> how<00:02:38.250> much<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
colleges pretty interesting how much the
