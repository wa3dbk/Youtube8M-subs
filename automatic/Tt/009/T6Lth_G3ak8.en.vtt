00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
the front pto my tractor I made this

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.520 
the front pto my tractor I made this
little<00:00:31.679> holder<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.429> to<00:00:32.519> sit<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.530> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
little holder for it to sit on the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
little holder for it to sit on the
wheels<00:00:34.769> can<00:00:35.039> still<00:00:35.280> pivot<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> front

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
wheels can still pivot on the front

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
wheels can still pivot on the front
while<00:00:36.269> this<00:00:36.500> still<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:38.070> working<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:40.250> have<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
while this still is working I have a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.689 
while this still is working I have a
panel<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.910> switches<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.019> could<00:00:43.230> run<00:00:43.699> angle

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699

that's<00:00:47.519> not<00:00:47.640> brush<00:00:48.109> brushless<00:00:49.109> because<00:00:49.859> those

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that's not brush brushless because those

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.139 
that's not brush brushless because those
are<00:00:50.160> AC<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.699> can<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.359> do<00:00:51.510> brushed<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.879> yeah<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
are AC I can only do brushed and yeah I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.079 
are AC I can only do brushed and yeah I
have<00:00:54.929> these<00:00:55.140> leads<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.769> down<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.760> ground

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
have these leads going down to ground

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.889 
have these leads going down to ground
clamp<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.989> I'll<00:00:58.920> lectured<00:00:59.219> holder<00:00:59.609> on

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
clamp and I'll lectured holder on

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
clamp and I'll lectured holder on
welding<00:01:00.899> cables<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.859> expensive<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.210> found

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
welding cables so expensive and I found

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.929 
welding cables so expensive and I found
a<00:01:03.809> better<00:01:03.929> alternative<00:01:04.140> um<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> get

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a better alternative um if you get

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.850 
a better alternative um if you get
yourself<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.360> cheap<00:01:06.570> pair<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> jumper<00:01:07.259> cables

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
yourself a cheap pair of jumper cables

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.639 
yourself a cheap pair of jumper cables
if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.640> cut<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> ends<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> hook<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
if you cut off the ends you can hook up

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.249 
if you cut off the ends you can hook up
your<00:01:10.970> electrode<00:01:11.970> holder<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> ground<00:01:13.049> clamp

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
your electrode holder and ground clamp

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.410 
your electrode holder and ground clamp
and<00:01:13.549> they're<00:01:14.549> rated<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.180> few<00:01:15.390> hundred

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and they're rated up to a few hundred

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
and they're rated up to a few hundred
amps<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.020> they're<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.799> jump-starting

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
amps because they're for jump-starting

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880 
amps because they're for jump-starting
cars<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.530> smart

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
cars so that was smart

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.639 
cars so that was smart
ah<00:01:21.799> here's<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:22.890> tractor<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.290> I'm<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.380> start

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
ah here's my tractor and I'm gonna start

00:01:25.649 --> 00:02:36.020 
ah here's my tractor and I'm gonna start
it<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> won't<00:01:31.469> be<00:01:31.619> able<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> hear<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.369> but

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.670 

I<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> very<00:02:41.490> uncomfortable<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.500> tried<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
I was a very uncomfortable I tried to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
I was a very uncomfortable I tried to
put<00:02:44.100> my<00:02:44.220> phone<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.819> my<00:02:44.850> welding<00:02:45.240> helmet<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.810> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
put my phone in my welding helmet so I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.050 
put my phone in my welding helmet so I
wouldn't<00:02:46.110> destroy<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.620> from<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> welding

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
wouldn't destroy it from the welding

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360 
wouldn't destroy it from the welding
light<00:02:48.240> but<00:02:48.569> uh<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.990> hope<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.950> caught<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.340> on

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
light but uh I hope I caught that on

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.660 
light but uh I hope I caught that on
video<00:02:50.580> um<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.980> going<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.250> chip<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.550> slag

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
video um I'm just going to chip the slag

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.620 
video um I'm just going to chip the slag
away<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.209> weld

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
away at that weld

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:21.820 
away at that weld
I<00:03:04.700> mean<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:17.300> can't<00:03:18.300> get<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.570> focus<00:03:18.989> but

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.800 

there's<00:03:22.830> some<00:03:23.069> holes<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.420> stuff<00:03:24.630> I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
there's some holes in there and stuff I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.090 
there's some holes in there and stuff I
just<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.319> my<00:03:25.590> fault

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just think that's my fault

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.630 
just think that's my fault
for<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:28.319> angle<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.920> everything<00:03:29.190> I'm<00:03:29.280> holding

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
for the angle and everything I'm holding

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.479 
for the angle and everything I'm holding
it<00:03:29.760> at<00:03:29.910> um<00:03:31.790> let's<00:03:32.790> try<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.090> again<00:03:33.180> actually

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it at um let's try that again actually

00:03:34.489 --> 00:04:57.570 
it at um let's try that again actually
I'll<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.670> right<00:03:36.209> back

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
but I didn't want to race the camera

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.679 
but I didn't want to race the camera
from<00:05:04.460> breaking<00:05:04.879> so<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.949> ran<00:05:07.300> three<00:05:08.300> quarters<00:05:08.659> of

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
from breaking so I ran three quarters of

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:16.089 
from breaking so I ran three quarters of
the<00:05:08.870> lectured<00:05:09.229> um<00:05:11.949> yeah<00:05:14.620> I'm<00:05:15.620> gonna<00:05:15.770> let<00:05:15.979> that

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:29.499 

drip<00:05:22.610> slag<00:05:25.599> literally<00:05:26.599> I<00:05:28.210> don't<00:05:29.210> know<00:05:29.300> what's

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
drip slag literally I don't know what's

drip slag literally I don't know what's
up<00:05:29.719> but<00:05:29.990> I<00:05:30.020> think<00:05:30.909> whatever<00:05:31.909> this<00:05:32.180> alternator

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
up but I think whatever this alternator

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.779 
up but I think whatever this alternator
is<00:05:32.810> running<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.229> at<00:05:33.409> it's<00:05:33.949> on<00:05:34.159> perfect

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
is running it at it's on perfect

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.320 
is running it at it's on perfect
settings<00:05:35.379> because<00:05:36.379> the<00:05:36.710> slag<00:05:37.009> falls<00:05:37.460> off<00:05:37.699> by

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
settings because the slag falls off by

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.649 
settings because the slag falls off by
itself<00:05:40.090> literally<00:05:42.490> just<00:05:43.490> give<00:05:43.699> it<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:43.879> small
