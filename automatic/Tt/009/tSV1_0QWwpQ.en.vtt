00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 or 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.510
 i 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.090
 hello dear creepy storekeepers in the 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.400
 English deck of cards we can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.830
 appreciate different characters of the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.670
 average age 'immortalized in the cards 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:45.030
 like the kings and queens but not today 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.250
 we will talk about the latter there is a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.830
 specific letter that can replace 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.430
 to any other in the table games 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.070
 I mean the soccer card is said 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.620
 that with this letter you can make a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.739
 paranormal game which is called 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.870
 Dancer joker dances but what does it consist of? 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 this game because the truth is very simple 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.549
 first of all I will tell you that there are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.220
 many versions of this story to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.090
 throughout the world and today I will offer you a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.220
 hybrid of all of them to start that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.190
 we need for this ritual is simple 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.680
 a joker card the version they choose 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 of this letter be it the colors or in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 black and white will change a lot the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.689
 development of this game in aspects 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.370
 and then a group of friends willing to 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.950
 participate in the ritual a knife 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.680
 and a black candle and a mirror according to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 some versions since they have the 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.590
 materials the way to perform the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.840
 ritual is the following put the letter 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.510
 of joker on the floor and light the candle 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 black the room in which 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.630
 find must be only illuminated by 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.850
 that candle for the ritual to work if 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.860
 they believe that the lighting of the candle is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.320
 very little there is a version of the story 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 in which you must put 11 candles forming 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.320
 a circle although it is believed that this 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.780
 version is less effective since 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.090
 they have the candle lit and the letter in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.660
 the soil the friends should form a 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.030
 circle around the letter all the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.490
 convened should take the knife and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 cut your hand to pour some 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.290
 your own blood on the letter 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 done and this players should 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.959
 say dance joker dances at the same time 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.670
 and rhythm an indeterminate number of times 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.940
 it's here when the thing gets 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.819
 interesting after they have 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.310
 said a good many times one of the 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.330
 members should place the mirror at 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.150
 side of the letter revealing its reflection 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.610
 The funny thing is that in the mirror they can 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.860
 see how the character inside the letter 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.769
 moves and stands to dance a 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.400
 very funny way you do not laugh 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.400
 no reason 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.660
 I previously told them that the development 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.820
 of the game would change according to the version of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190
 the letter that you chose then is here 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.460
 where those differences start to 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.800
 notice if you laugh at the dance of the version 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.350
 in colors it is said that you receive a 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.020
 very strong blow somewhere in your 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.110
 body and you must pay the joker company 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.690
 or food is said that this is the version 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.840
 more sure of this ritual since in 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.270
 No time do you risk your life in 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.220
 change if you choose the white version and 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.220
 black the thing gets more interesting 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.900
 in this version you think you're 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.300
 invoking a demon to be 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.730
 transform into the joker so it 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.490
 recommends drawing a staff made 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.880
 with cemetery land and salt around 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.459
 of the letter the punishment you take if 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.710
 you laugh at this letter is one that still does not 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.500
 is well specified because 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.300
 so many versions of this story this 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.640
 part is the one that takes the most 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.560
 variation throughout the world so 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.100
 that now I will tell you the most punishments 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.830
 spread it is said that if you laugh at your 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.690
 dance will appear you cut of knife 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.510
 in the body for two weeks 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.030
 followed by a relative of yours will die 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.950
 the number of times you laugh or you 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.580
 they will stab you in the back and you will die 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.350
 during the course of the game it is said 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.200
 that if you put your hand to the staff 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.660
 while the joker is dancing you will see 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.090
 through the mirror as the jester takes off 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.180
 a knife from his pocket and he throws a 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.940
 stab when you take the hand of the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.370
 pentagram you will have a severe cut on your 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.490
 hand 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.889
 with both letters the only way in which 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.010
 you can stop the ritual is turning off 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.500
 all the candles in the event that 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.900
 put the 11 candles these should 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.540
 shut off counter to the needles 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.210
 of the clock 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.640
 just before turning off the last candle 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.940
 you can see the shadow of the joker pass and 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.800
 leave the letter when this happens 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.800
 they will know that the game will be over
