00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello my name is Eva, I'm a jirí teacher 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.580
 languages ​​codes and their technologies 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.259
 I'm here to talk just about some 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 enem's tips 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.140
 first I will introduce the area to this area 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.840
 one has five subject area 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 languages ​​codes and their technologies 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 Portuguese language 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.369
 she has a modern foreign language that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 can be read in Spanish the student can 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.239
 choose between one or the other have also 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 art education and computer science 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.559
 This is a test that usually 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 connection between these disciplines 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.809
 It's very difficult for us to find a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.090
 an issue that is only 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 matter usually it connects the many 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 disciplines and so it is already 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 interdisciplinary student he has to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.920
 stay very focused on 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.329
 several important things 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 some of them are the varieties 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.619
 for example he finds 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 many areas very many issues 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 of these varieties in charge of comparison 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.220
 of cartoons with songs and texts from the media 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 he will find news find 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 internet news finally 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 then have to okay this is turned on 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.080
 in these texts you see very carefully 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.110
 these texts because they are good texts 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 selected and he has to stay very 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.079
 concentrated on this reading and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 these issues because in addition to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.430
 interdisciplinary, that is to link these 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.530
 disciplines together 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.770
 these issues they usually address the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.299
 day-to-day this is how we talk it is in the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 Rio Grande do Sul 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.579
 such a word in the northeast as it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.040
 she finally she these social varieties 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.380
 they are welcome but generally neither 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.780
 has this very open look due to the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.759
 linguistic partner is then for the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.079
 varieties is still very important is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.960
 one is a subject matter is important 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.429
 In this test the student will also 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.489
 worry has to worry a little 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.980
 with classic questions for example can 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.060
 fall a classic in the past 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.959
 moniz the mother is also compared with arts 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.720
 plastic 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.330
 then in relation to content the student reads 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
 well camo poem needs to be 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.080
 quite concentrated in reading because 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.080
 because in that subject of the poem may come 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.209
 a matter related to one frame 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.489
 a classic work also from the period of the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.709
 rebirth and he has to see how it is 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.430
 that the theme in this poem of 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.150
 and also in this 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.370
 painting 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.220
 this is an issue another one is 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.190
 questions concerning the way in which 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.430
 as the languages ​​as the words of the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.890
 students with fanfare at last everyday 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.549
 they circulate in the media on the internet for 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.349
 example then the salaries in the mails 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.629
 How do you pronounce it more? 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.540
 how do you write in the emails in the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.810
 languages ​​are adequate to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.609
 certain contexts or not in the then 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.680
 student he has to be a very student 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:21.799
 is current in the sense of looking at language 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.840
 in today's contemporary world 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.730
 have to know how to read texts 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.130
 classic but with enough openness to 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.000
 the forms that circulate to the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.329
 languages ​​that circulate and be always 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.060
 considering always balance 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:45.260
 about on the way the proper way 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.120
 to put in these contexts issues 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.599
 also interdisciplinary 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.359
 is very common is to appear for example 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.660
 a poem by carlos drummond de andrade 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 or of manhole of mud that covers something 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.669
 about a social context the context 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.940
 regional context, for example a context 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:07.700
 Speak of water that speaks of what it's all about 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.709
 of the environment on the garbage 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.269
 then these issues are also very 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.609
 interesting there do not have to read the poem 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.500
 but always on I also found in 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.139
 other contexts that do not concern 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.019
 Only the Portuguese language is a student. 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.920
 you really need to worry because 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.930
 he is 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.300
 selected is being charged goes 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.430
 be required of him on 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 how it can intervene 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.270
 in their reality these questions in the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.180
 true that he will respond 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.640
 are issues in which it will goes as if 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.340
 put is critically 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.410
 in fact what he lived 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 so how do you critically put yourself 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.670
 in what position does he have to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.320
 show society in relation to your 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.320
 experience in relation to your world. 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.980
 so what he has to do is if 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.250
 prepare to read take a test with 45 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.070
 questions are 45 texts 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.100
 she is a little bit slow it 's a little 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.690
 tiring has to have this resistance 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.770
 concentration and attention 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.770
 reading this
