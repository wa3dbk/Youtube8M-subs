this<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.520> how<00:02:29.180> Microsoft<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:30.290> gonna

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
this is going to how Microsoft is gonna

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.250 
this is going to how Microsoft is gonna
work<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.130> into<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.520> machine<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.750> will<00:02:32.930> not

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.490 
work this into a machine but it will not
work<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.370> leads<00:02:34.580> me<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.820> believe<00:02:35.290> how<00:02:36.290> can
