00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.970
 I am the sand and aquino and I am the director 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.130
 of the great poor timoteo circus 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.690
 it's about circus chou timoteo that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.540
 It's a circus that travels Chile makes more 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.970
 40 years old and that is characterized and is 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.890
 known and very popular because he has a 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.050
 transformer show that is like 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.939
 the main course the show of life 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.800
 friends beautiful because life has to be 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.750
 live it after we are dead 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.100
 silent those who enjoy worms to 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 times for the photo by the jet that 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.309
 they go down well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.079
 the owner and leader and protagonist of this 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 rené valdés movie comedian 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.699
 timoteo that today by its age and its 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.979
 health status has somehow 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.769
 generated some uncertainty about the 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.570
 continuity of the circus there are artists who 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.010
 they came to this circus being 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.199
 teenagers therefore this too 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.089
 It is your home and it has become a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 true refuge for artists 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.659
 homosexuals and today they wonder what is going to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.440
 go through with it if it 's that rené decides 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.440
 backing out 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.369
 even when the natural ones of the rope 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.810
 although in a circus tremendously 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.520
 popular in a circus that is 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.490
 completely out of the media 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.280
 officers is a popular 5 because it travels 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.679
 Chile because it works all year 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.049
 because it does not seem to me that 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.670
 side the circus deserves recognition 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.420
 as part of our heritage 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.420
 structural 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 I think it's a movie that 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.310
 Wake senses jumps and wake up 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.590
 many emotions a lot of humor a lot 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.829
 reflection and also by the way much 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.829
 curiosity 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.470
 we won a body of development and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.570
 we made some first recordings and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.580
 then we won the production body and 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.500
 the ibermedia program for co-production 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.220
 and then we started filming the shoot lasted 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.220
 approximately two years 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.660
 a pretty long process quite 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.880
 intense he had a lot of patience for many 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 shooting hours to find the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.390
 movie that finally ends 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.220
 finding in the assembly process and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.530
 many mounts were also almost two 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.060
 years and today I'm in a movie that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.840
 has completely satisfied that all 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.840
 In the goal 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.530
 Now that we are finished, we are invited to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.390
 make the world premiere at the festival 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.940
 visions du réel festival is 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 tremendously prestigious in what is 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.900
 refers to author documentaries and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.420
 we hope it is a great point that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.700
 initial 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.680
 for a successful path because to me 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.630
 it seems that he makes a patrimonial rescue 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.209
 of an aspect of our culture that does not 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.250
 we would like it to be seen as 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.459
 possible in Chile and not see it 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.530
 only my documentary notes 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.750
 but take the aloe see it more 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.890
 possible people the people on foot of the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.600
 people that makes you want to see a good 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.210
 movie 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.210
 and to know one more part of that
