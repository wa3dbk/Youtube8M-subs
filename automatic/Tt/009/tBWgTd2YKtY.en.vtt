00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all in this video I show you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 what I purchased from the collection 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 autumn type in practice ho 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 bought only two things and in the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.880
 related review that you will find on the blog 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 of which I put the link in the box 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.920
 information under the video you will find a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 the reasons that led me to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 buy only these two products e 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.609
 you will also find some considerations 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 general about the collection I had 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.460
 way to try bloom test a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 little in store the products I have 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260
 decided to buy are two pallets of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.450
 eye shadows as you usually know I love 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 very kiko eye shadow palettes 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.719
 and I bought two colors the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.789
 number 01 is the number 02 the palettes that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.190
 precisely they have this type of packaging 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.860
 they obviously come out inside theirs 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.309
 cardboard packaging and equipped with 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.530
 this mini dust bag made in a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.899
 velvet-like fabric 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 a little like most 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 palettes just proposed by kiko in the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 latest collections in this case 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.159
 specific however the packaging remembers 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.080
 very much that of the collection of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 last fall the chic chalet and then 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 in fact the reminder is particularly 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.570
 the pallets are also evident in this case 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.210
 provide four colors for each one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.040
 total of 8 grams a duration of six 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 months from the opening of course if there 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.140
 adequately preserve the dust 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.020
 they last even longer and the cost is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.250
 always 12 euros and 90 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.220
 the coloration number 01 is inspired by the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.240
 shades of brown 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.850
 here they are precisely four shades 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.600
 all cimmer however all very much 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.270
 bright except the first color 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.490
 which instead appears to be satin vi 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.490
 I make a close-up shot 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.530
 obviously now we are going to see them 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.740
 also the second stakes blossomed 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 instead it is inspired by the colors of the plum 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.789
 of the bordeaux and this is what I find here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.400
 really very pretty 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.890
 also because I believe they are colors 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.829
 really very autumn that fit 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.560
 very well to both green eyes and 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.930
 blue or to hazel eyes or 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.060
 however dark they are therefore colors 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.810
 really interested in this case too 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.319
 the colors are all bright except 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.109
 this one below in the second line 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.980
 which turns out to be less bright than chavo is 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.980
 a satin color 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.320
 here are the colors of the first palette like 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.360
 you can see they are all bright colors 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.610
 except as I told you the first one that didn't 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.870
 it is completely opaque absolutely or 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.550
 satin color 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.710
 the only thing I would like you to notice 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.130
 I take this opportunity because it is now 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.430
 particularly visible and this 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.660
 speech related to the composition of 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.400
 waffle as you can see in the passage 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.620
 one of the applicator was raised 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.170
 this is a fair amount of dust 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.520
 because the pods are quite soft 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.190
 is a flaw in quotation marks that entails 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.790
 here is a bit more dust 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.190
 accentuated of the product and that often 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.470
 we also find in other brands such as ad 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.110
 example the slick palettes 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.120
 in this case the only thing I can 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.550
 tell you when you are going to apply 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.130
 these three colors with a common brush 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.080
 the product may appear a little 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.180
 fluttering accordingly I will 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.220
 advice or use an applicator 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.769
 of sponge that surely solves the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.900
 problem or use colors with 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.110
 the wet method that will also tend to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.260
 further accentuate these reflections 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.050
 or you could decide to apply them 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.180
 on a slightly creamier primer 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.420
 such as a market time that 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.959
 will tend to better fix the il 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.959
 color 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.760
 here are the colors of the second palette and 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.040
 this is the third color this here that 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.410
 as I said before it turns out to be 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.020
 satin like the first color of the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.810
 first palette I believe that these colors 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.140
 be really beautiful a bell 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.420
 assortment 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.130
 and it is indeed really very autumnal between 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.010
 the other, as I said, fits a little 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.260
 to every really nice shade of eyes 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.540
 here too I would like you to notice the 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.830
 speech of the softness of the waffle 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.390
 this one in particular is really 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 terrible because just enough and ashes 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.970
 slightly in pressure and create 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.740
 just a bit of a disaster because then 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.350
 firm it also goes to ruin 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.540
 inevitably so I believe that 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.610
 this softness of the waffle is a bit 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.010
 the only defect of these of these 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.170
 the rest of the palette instead I have 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.630
 liked they are really writers 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.820
 pigmented are really good I would like 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.710
 add one last thing and with that 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.530
 I conclude the review concerning the 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.830
 packaging and in particular the choice of 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.560
 insert inside the packages 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.110
 these velvet-like bags the choice 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.170
 to insert these bags draws 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.870
 very high brand packaging 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.190
 perfumery such as dior chanel e 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.380
 so on 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.690
 However, I believe him to be a little more 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.200
 justified because the product is anyway 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.140
 in itself it costs much more than a product 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.660
 kiko and also in those cases the 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.630
 packages are usually of the type 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.840
 lacquered they are of the chrome type therefore 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.720
 however actually a small bag 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.480
 can protect a box that for 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.600
 if it is more valuable in quotes 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.850
 in this case instead the packaging 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.280
 usually made precisely in 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.230
 plastic most often in plastic 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.020
 satin like for example demonstrate 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.560
 also the packs of the others 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.290
 collections and also are products that 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.790
 therefore they are born as low cost products 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.860
 probably the choice to insert 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.770
 these little bags as far as they can 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.529
 being pretty actually turns out to be useless and 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.539
 it just goes maybe 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.369
 increase a cost that could 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.919
 be slightly reduced because 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:37.109
 however the packs are already on their own 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.049
 they are very nice if they have limited 

00:06:37.109 --> 00:06:42.359
 edition the design or in any case the 

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:45.349
 engravings that are above yellow 

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:47.699
 they embellish I think they add 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.649
 other details such as i 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.389
 sacchettini simply go to 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.359
 affect the cost 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:56.489
 moreover I personally tend to 

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:59.939
 that is, abandoning them in the sense that I find 

00:06:56.489 --> 00:07:01.859
 inconvenient to have to insert and remove each 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.989
 once I use the product 

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:07.199
 palettes from the bag also because 

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:11.039
 I'm so tired that we must also 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.139
 co lose some time to reinsert 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.069
 the product you see inside is not 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:19.439
 right here you see I'm really a lot 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.969
 very shaped here so I believe that 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.939
 in the end it is a bit of an operation 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:26.039
 inconvenient as a result I do not 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:29.429
 use the most uses on palettes 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:31.889
 and reuse it for jewelry so I have 

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:34.199
 decided to make this use different to 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:36.749
 example the pendants the necklaces e 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.239
 bracelets I put them in the jewelry box 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:41.729
 with this kind of bag this 

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:45.299
 here it was really of the cic salt of the 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:46.769
 last year and in fact exploit them in 

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.989
 this way could be an idea 

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:50.789
 nice for you too I hope this 

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:52.559
 video may have been useful to you vi 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.509
 I remember going to consult the review 

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:56.639
 complete where you will find many others 

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.719
 information in the meantime I greet you and al 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.719
 next video hello
