00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello everyone with you amato and guys i like 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.100
 promised to do one video can and in 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.719
 the future will do okay not the point at 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 one video on the topic you suggested 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.250
 one of my followers 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.550
 the topic will be called why people go 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.900
 more often in crime than the boss I don't know 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.830
 for someone this topic will seem a bit 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.020
 banal but not for me i will try by 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.890
 maximum uncover the whole point why so 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.050
 happens most often ok let's get started 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.470
 probably from the fact that I will bring a couple 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.300
 examples an hour is already deep night and i like 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.810
 always absolutely not preparing for the movie I 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.730
 always do it all spontaneously 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.660
 to maximize you to your 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.670
 soul 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:54.579
 Okay, okay , firstly, why is it? 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.559
 you understood yes because most 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.590
 wrestling is a very huge percentage of players 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.440
 samp-rp floor colors and which have 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.140
 school and they absolutely have no time 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.049
 engage in such garbage obey 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.969
 some other scholars who are on one 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.929
 class is older than they are and which 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:18.219
 order them fucking get up fucking hard hat 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.299
 dress shave go to another post and even 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.859
 it infuriates me 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.420
 But imagine how a bit of schoolboys 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:26.829
 who want just elementary 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.090
 freedom in the gaming spaces it was one 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.060
 from my examples 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.079
 ok second example second example this 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.969
 what I think they think here is the second 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.779
 I do not want an example as correct as possible 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:45.270
 I do not want to offend the players myself 

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:45.270
 sermon you're all my viewers ok 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.360
 I think that just people are huge yet 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 the percentage of people who play the samp-rp 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.620
 then more intelligent people because fucking 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.410
 Well, no, I personally do not like to obey 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.300
 some stupid morons I go to play 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.130
 your pleasure this game and here 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.070
 there must be complete freedom 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.840
 and why should we obey me already 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.030
 not long ago scholars and why am I 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.930
 I must obey as I said these 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.580
 stupid scholars 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.100
 correct we should not secondly it 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.770
 these restrictions are related to your 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.750
 real life for example the fact that here I am not 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 I know how on other servers this 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 moment the game is at 0 2 because it is the first 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.989
 I was banned by Brian Davis will give him 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.370
 hi pidaras fucking oooookey 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.970
 connected to your reality life that is 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.720
 on the first serve to do for example 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.280
 to a driving school or city hall you had to 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.050
 be sure to be very literate 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.820
 man i don't refuse i 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.390
 really not stupid for me though 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.350
 some level of literacy can 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.410
 60 percent but still I write 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.970
 practically no spelling errors 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.690
 can sometimes there somewhere put extra 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.110
 comma 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.709
 Okay, it doesn't matter, and why is it that I? 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.680
 I do not understand well, okay then let there children 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.480

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.769

 him some other schoolboy who 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.150
 passed all this garbage into two classes 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.860
