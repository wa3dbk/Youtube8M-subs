cuts<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.390> important<00:02:06.780> third<00:02:07.409> cut

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
cuts are not really important third cut

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.260 
cuts are not really important third cut

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
cards this is gonna be strange

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.270

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
right now the cards are on their way if

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.190 
right now the cards are on their way if
I<00:02:23.430> untwist<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.540> kind<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.020> good

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I untwist it that's so kind of a good

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.920 
I untwist it that's so kind of a good
start<00:02:26.030> looks<00:02:27.030> kind<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.270> weird<00:02:27.450> doesn't<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> so

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
start looks kind of weird doesn't it so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.360 
start looks kind of weird doesn't it so
good<00:02:28.080> start<00:02:28.350> but<00:02:28.740> here's<00:02:28.950> where<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.100> gets<00:02:29.280> even

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
good start but here's where it gets even

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.740 
good start but here's where it gets even
more<00:02:29.520> bizarre<00:02:29.910> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.390> twist<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
more bizarre I'm going to twist the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.870 
more bizarre I'm going to twist the
cards<00:02:31.080> by<00:02:31.500> turning<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:31.980> both<00:02:32.190> together

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
cards by turning them both together

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.660 
cards by turning them both together
watch<00:02:33.060> closely<00:02:33.410> clockwise<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.520> what

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
watch closely clockwise see that's what

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.240 
watch closely clockwise see that's what
makes<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.910> work<00:02:36.090> turning<00:02:36.840> them<00:02:36.960> clockwise<00:02:37.250> one

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
makes it work turning them clockwise one

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.860 
makes it work turning them clockwise one
card<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.700> actually<00:02:38.880> passing<00:02:39.510> through<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
card is actually passing through the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.340 
card is actually passing through the
other<00:02:40.160> see<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.760> both<00:02:41.970> sides<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.420> course<00:02:42.630> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
other see on both sides of course the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.220 
other see on both sides of course the
trick<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.160> switch<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> corners<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.600> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
trick is to switch the corners here the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.660 
trick is to switch the corners here the
outer<00:02:46.350> two<00:02:46.650> corners<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.280> inner<00:02:47.460> two

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
outer two corners and the inner two

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.920 
outer two corners and the inner two
corners<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.290> continue<00:02:49.800> with<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> twist

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
corners now I can continue with a twist

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.330 
corners now I can continue with a twist
it's<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.170> weird<00:02:52.410> now<00:02:52.590> right<00:02:52.800> now<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> cards

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it's not weird now right now the cards

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.300 
it's not weird now right now the cards
are<00:02:53.430> not<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.940> here<00:02:54.500> right<00:02:55.500> now<00:02:55.680> both<00:02:55.890> cards

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
are not really here right now both cards

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
are not really here right now both cards
are<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> fourth<00:02:56.850> dimension<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.570> most

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
are in the fourth dimension and most

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.630 
are in the fourth dimension and most
magicians<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.490> it's<00:02:59.580> really

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
magicians that know this and it's really

magicians that know this and it's really
only<00:02:59.820> a<00:03:00.030> handful<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> world<00:03:00.900> they<00:03:01.470> would

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
only a handful in the world they would

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.420 
only a handful in the world they would
stop<00:03:01.950> right<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.370> that's<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:02.820> they<00:03:02.970> know

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.950 

here's<00:03:11.430> where<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.730> gets<00:03:11.880> weird<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.360> twist<00:03:12.720> it

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
here's where it gets weird if I twist it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.180 
here's where it gets weird if I twist it
and<00:03:13.400> switch<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.610> corners<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
and switch the corners back but in the

and switch the corners back but in the
opposite<00:03:17.640> order<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.470> opposite

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
opposite order and in the opposite

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.699 
opposite order and in the opposite
direction<00:03:20.480> something<00:03:21.480> very<00:03:21.870> strange<00:03:22.230> happens

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
direction something very strange happens

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.830 
direction something very strange happens
the<00:03:23.640> cards<00:03:23.940> come<00:03:24.120> back<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.480> Hollywood

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the cards come back to Hollywood

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.300 
the cards come back to Hollywood
California<00:03:25.020> but<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:25.560> come<00:03:25.740> back<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.130> very

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
California but they come back in a very

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.699 
California but they come back in a very
strangely<00:03:26.880> altered<00:03:27.150> state<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.350> peel<00:03:28.590> them

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
strangely altered state if I peel them

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.610 
strangely altered state if I peel them
apart<00:03:29.120> you'll<00:03:30.120> notice<00:03:30.360> now<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.720> card<00:03:31.020> has<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
apart you'll notice now this card has a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.790 
apart you'll notice now this card has a
back<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.790> both<00:03:33.060> sides<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:34.110> if<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.620> look<00:03:34.770> very

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
back on both sides and if you look very

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500 
back on both sides and if you look very
closely<00:03:35.190> you'll<00:03:35.550> see<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> actually<00:03:36.120> has

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
closely you'll see that it actually has

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.220 
closely you'll see that it actually has
the<00:03:37.110> identifying<00:03:37.740> marks<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.660> top<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the identifying marks and the top and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.400 
the identifying marks and the top and
the<00:03:40.380> bottom<00:03:40.560> ends<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.490> why<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.060> do

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410
