all right this is a 2001 Dodge Dakota I
had<00:00:04.650> problems<00:00:05.160> with<00:00:05.279> my<00:00:05.339> shifter<00:00:06.299> sticking<00:00:06.720> in

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
had problems with my shifter sticking in

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.370 
had problems with my shifter sticking in
Park<00:00:07.200> well<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.440> found<00:00:07.799> what<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.099> problem<00:00:08.519> was

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
Park well I found what the problem was

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
Park well I found what the problem was

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
if you look over here now if I can get a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.499 
if you look over here now if I can get a
good<00:00:12.210> video<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:13.280> on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.580> side<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> column

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
good video on on the side of the column

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.310 
good video on on the side of the column
here<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.900> got<00:00:16.170> it

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
here I got it

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.590 
here I got it
torn<00:00:16.590> apart<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.369> take<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.699> off<00:00:17.850> you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
torn apart here you can take it off you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.170 
torn apart here you can take it off you
can<00:00:18.750> take<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> covers<00:00:19.380> off<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.830> view<00:00:20.279> what's

can take the covers off and view what's

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
can take the covers off and view what's
going<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> look<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
going on here and if you look at the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.740 
going on here and if you look at the
shifter<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.619> there's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:26.210> mechanical<00:00:27.210> stop

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
shifter here there's a mechanical stop

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.410 
shifter here there's a mechanical stop
there<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.179> where<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> shifting<00:00:31.369> right

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
there you see where I'm shifting right

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
there you see where I'm shifting right
back<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.840> there's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> stop<00:00:34.680> button<00:00:35.010> there

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
back here there's a stop button there

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.569 
back here there's a stop button there
and<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.180> happening<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.309> wasn't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and what was happening is it it wasn't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.650 
and what was happening is it it wasn't
every<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> turn<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> truck<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.910> stop

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
every time I turn the truck on that stop

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.910 
every time I turn the truck on that stop
wasn't<00:00:43.730> retracting<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.660> keep

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
wasn't retracting and and it would keep

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.709 
wasn't retracting and and it would keep
it<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> stick<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.390> park<00:00:48.570> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it would make it stick and park I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
it would make it stick and park I
wouldn't<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.020> able<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> shift<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> right

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
wouldn't be able to shift it and right

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
wouldn't be able to shift it and right
here<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.300> slide<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:52.219> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
here there's a little slide here that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.470 
here there's a little slide here that
slides<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.030> forth<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:55.230> releases<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
slides back and forth that releases this

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.740 
slides back and forth that releases this
pin<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
pin right here and right here is a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.380 
pin right here and right here is a
mechanical<00:01:00.750> interlock<00:01:01.309> that's<00:01:02.390> associated

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
mechanical interlock that's associated

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.660 
mechanical interlock that's associated
with<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> ignition<00:01:04.170> switch<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
with the ignition switch and what I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.960 
with the ignition switch and what I
found<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.380> read<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.670> stuff

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
found out is that I read some stuff

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
found out is that I read some stuff
online<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> thought<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.080> solenoid

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
online I thought there was solenoid

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
online I thought there was solenoid
involved<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> people<00:01:12.420> thought

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
involved which a lot of people thought

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
involved which a lot of people thought
that<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> push<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> brake<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.520> would

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that if you push the brake it would

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.359 
that if you push the brake it would
engage<00:01:15.330> Illinois<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.380> disengage

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
engage Illinois which would disengage

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
engage Illinois which would disengage
the<00:01:17.700> interlock<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.330> well<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the interlock here well that's not the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
the interlock here well that's not the
case<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.100> strictly<00:01:20.549> mechanical<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
case this is strictly mechanical here so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
case this is strictly mechanical here so
if<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.140> turn<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> ignition<00:01:22.830> switch<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
if I turn the ignition switch on and I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
if I turn the ignition switch on and I
fixed<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> problem<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.259> doesn't<00:01:25.439> stick

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fixed the problem now it doesn't stick

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
fixed the problem now it doesn't stick
anymore<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.549> some<00:01:26.729> wd-40<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
anymore I put some wd-40 up here in the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
anymore I put some wd-40 up here in the
slide<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.770> happening<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> slide

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
slide what was happening as the slide

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.330 
slide what was happening as the slide
was<00:01:30.030> sticking<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> forth<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.040> every

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
was sticking back and forth so now every

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.929 
was sticking back and forth so now every
time<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> turn<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:35.430> mechanical

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
time I turn it on that that mechanical

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.420 
time I turn it on that that mechanical
interlock<00:01:36.270> disengages<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.890> turned<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
interlock disengages how it turned on to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
interlock disengages how it turned on to
see<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.090> supposed<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> end<00:01:39.540> disengage

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
see how it's supposed to end disengage

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.179 
see how it's supposed to end disengage
and<00:01:40.490> when<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> turn<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:44.009> going

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and when I when I turn it off it's going

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.520 
and when I when I turn it off it's going
to<00:01:44.280> engage<00:01:44.369> back<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.720> allowing<00:01:46.200> not

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
to engage back in not allowing not

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
to engage back in not allowing not
allowing<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> shift<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:48.229> out<00:01:49.229> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
allowing you to shift it back out of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.179 
allowing you to shift it back out of
part<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> got<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> same<00:01:52.380> problem<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
part so if you got the same problem that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.710 
part so if you got the same problem that
I've<00:01:53.460> been<00:01:53.490> having<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.390> dumbfounded

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I've been having and I was dumbfounded

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
I've been having and I was dumbfounded
at<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.310> after<00:01:56.460> reading<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.880> few<00:01:56.909> things

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
at first but after reading a few things

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
at first but after reading a few things
online<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:58.520> found<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> out<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:02.100> can

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
online I found this out and you can

a rubber boot that goes around the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
a rubber boot that goes around the
shifter<00:02:09.270> right<00:02:09.450> about<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.830> just

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
shifter right about here you can just

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.309 
shifter right about here you can just
simply<00:02:11.340> pull<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> rubber

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
happened on my problem so it might be

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.789 
happened on my problem so it might be
worth<00:02:27.139> the<00:02:27.939> trying<00:02:28.939> if<00:02:29.599> that's<00:02:30.019> ever<00:02:30.500> the

that<00:02:49.909> slide<00:02:50.469> will<00:02:51.469> slide<00:02:52.159> back<00:02:52.430> it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that slide will slide back it's

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.080 
that slide will slide back it's
spring-loaded<00:02:53.060> right<00:02:54.049> up<00:02:54.199> here<00:02:54.379> is<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> spring

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
spring-loaded right up here is a spring

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.270 
spring-loaded right up here is a spring
so<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.239> should<00:02:56.419> be<00:02:56.599> it's<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.530> all<00:02:57.709> mechanical

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
so it should be it's just all mechanical

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.819 
so it should be it's just all mechanical
see<00:02:59.209> how<00:02:59.359> I<00:02:59.389> can<00:02:59.480> push<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.959> slide<00:03:00.260> forward

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
see how I can push that slide forward

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.949 
see how I can push that slide forward
and<00:03:00.949> back<00:03:01.159> and<00:03:01.340> forth<00:03:01.719> that's<00:03:02.719> strictly

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and back and forth that's strictly

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.170 
and back and forth that's strictly
mechanical<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.400> that's<00:03:04.519> what<00:03:04.699> was<00:03:04.790> happening

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
mechanical and that's what was happening

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.789 
mechanical and that's what was happening
it<00:03:05.269> was<00:03:05.329> sticking<00:03:05.719> like<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.169> and<00:03:06.469> it<00:03:06.620> wasn't

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
it was sticking like that and it wasn't

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:07.589 
it was sticking like that and it wasn't
moving<00:03:07.099> all<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.340> time

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
moving all the time

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.349 
moving all the time
this<00:03:08.599> here<00:03:09.049> there's<00:03:09.409> nothing<00:03:09.859> at<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:11.120> little

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
this here there's nothing at this little

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.229 
this here there's nothing at this little
lever<00:03:11.599> here<00:03:12.189> once<00:03:13.189> you<00:03:13.340> turn<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.699> ignition<00:03:13.790> on

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
lever here once you turn the ignition on

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.509 
lever here once you turn the ignition on
every<00:03:15.079> liver<00:03:15.349> can<00:03:15.560> float<00:03:15.829> back<00:03:16.099> and<00:03:16.310> forth

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
every liver can float back and forth

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.960 
every liver can float back and forth
that<00:03:16.699> don't<00:03:16.879> matter<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:18.519> when<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.669> turn<00:03:19.819> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
that don't matter so when you turn the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.729 
that don't matter so when you turn the
ignition<00:03:20.060> off<00:03:20.419> that<00:03:20.750> lever<00:03:21.019> locks<00:03:21.379> in<00:03:21.590> place

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
ignition off that lever locks in place

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.170 
ignition off that lever locks in place
forward<00:03:22.340> like<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.720> keeping<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.810> pin

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
forward like that keeping the pin

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.270 
forward like that keeping the pin
engaged<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.930> over<00:03:27.199> here<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:27.859> when<00:03:28.009> I<00:03:28.040> turn

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
engaged right over here so when I turn

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.369 
engaged right over here so when I turn
it<00:03:28.310> off<00:03:28.489> if<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.389> watch<00:03:29.689> this<00:03:30.019> right<00:03:30.319> here

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
it off if you watch this right here

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.170 
it off if you watch this right here
you'll<00:03:30.919> see<00:03:30.949> that<00:03:31.189> lever<00:03:31.400> push<00:03:31.669> it<00:03:31.819> forward

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
you'll see that lever push it forward

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.969 
you'll see that lever push it forward
that's<00:03:32.479> basically<00:03:32.870> what<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.109> lever<00:03:33.439> does<00:03:33.680> is

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
that's basically what that lever does is

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.069 
that's basically what that lever does is
just<00:03:34.669> push<00:03:34.939> it<00:03:35.090> forward<00:03:35.479> so<00:03:35.629> it<00:03:35.720> locks<00:03:35.900> in

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
just push it forward so it locks in

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.400 
just push it forward so it locks in
place<00:03:36.229> but<00:03:36.949> anyway
