00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you guys see on screen here here's a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.910 
you guys see on screen here here's a
little<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.760> code<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.300> GTA<00:00:51.719> online

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
little bit of code from GTA online

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
little bit of code from GTA online
apparently<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.550> stuff<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> as

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
apparently this is some new stuff and as

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.150 
apparently this is some new stuff and as
you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.350> says<00:00:55.500> apartment<00:00:55.980> /

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you can see it says apartment /

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.360 
you can see it says apartment /
customization<00:00:57.000> /<00:00:57.329> creators<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.440> essentially

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
customization / creators so essentially

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
customization / creators so essentially
what<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> might<00:00:59.910> mean<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.930> might<00:01:01.109> be

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
what this might mean is that we might be

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
what this might mean is that we might be
able<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:01.530> creator<00:01:02.129> mode<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.850> own

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
able to use creator mode for our own

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
able to use creator mode for our own
apartment<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> down

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
apartment so as you can see you down

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
apartment so as you can see you down
here<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.129> says<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> add<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> chair<00:01:06.450> /

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
here it says that you can add a chair /

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.380 
here it says that you can add a chair /
couch<00:01:07.110> bed<00:01:07.590> /<00:01:07.890> table<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:08.970> pick<00:01:09.150> some

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
couch bed / table you can pick some

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
couch bed / table you can pick some
colors<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.710> exit<00:01:11.070> work<00:01:11.280> save<00:01:11.610> work

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
colors and you can exit work save work

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.660 
colors and you can exit work save work
and<00:01:12.119> add<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.650> essentially<00:01:14.549> what

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and add work there so essentially what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
and add work there so essentially what
this<00:01:14.820> probably<00:01:15.150> means<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.900> use

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this probably means is that you can use

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
this probably means is that you can use
creative<00:01:16.380> mode<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.799> apartment<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.600 
connoisseur anything well actually it's
the<00:01:41.040> code<00:01:41.340> name<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> ps4<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:44.250> might<00:01:44.460> be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the code name for the ps4 so we might be

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.639 
the code name for the ps4 so we might be
seeing<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.329> coming<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> ps4<00:01:46.020> later<00:01:46.470> on

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
seeing this coming to the ps4 later on

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
seeing this coming to the ps4 later on
when<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.759> confused<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
when I'm a little bit confused about is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.630 
when I'm a little bit confused about is
why<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.780> doesn't<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.770> Xbox<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
why it doesn't have this for Xbox so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.999 
why it doesn't have this for Xbox so
obviously<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.200> doesn't<00:01:52.229> say<00:01:52.590> Xbox

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
obviously right now it doesn't say Xbox

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
obviously right now it doesn't say Xbox
there<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.670> might<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.970> seeing<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:54.810> more

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
there but we might be seeing some more

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440 
there but we might be seeing some more
xbox<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.590> stuff<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> near<00:01:57.000> future<00:01:57.030> now

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
xbox one stuff in the near future now

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850

the<00:02:26.970> game<00:02:27.120> why<00:02:27.330> not<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.810> we're<00:02:28.530> probably

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the game why not and we're probably

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.380 
the game why not and we're probably
going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.040> seeing<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.150> an<00:02:30.270> upcoming

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
going to be seeing this in an upcoming

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960 
going to be seeing this in an upcoming
DLC<00:02:30.780> I'm<00:02:31.170> not<00:02:31.320> too<00:02:31.500> sure<00:02:31.710> when<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.730> most

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
DLC I'm not too sure when but most

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
DLC I'm not too sure when but most
likely<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.540> will<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.960> coming<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.830> DLC

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
likely this will be coming in a DLC

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
likely this will be coming in a DLC
sometime<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> near<00:02:36.210> future<00:02:36.270> as<00:02:36.720> forth<00:02:36.990> a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
sometime in the near future as forth a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.710 
sometime in the near future as forth a
ps4<00:02:37.350> version<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.460> Orbis<00:02:38.970> or<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.390> Orbis

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
ps4 version and the Orbis or the Orbis

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960 
ps4 version and the Orbis or the Orbis
rather<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.380> don't<00:02:40.950> think<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.580> update

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
rather I don't think that the update

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.120 
rather I don't think that the update
will<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.150> coming<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.870> ps4<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.830> know<00:02:43.950> as

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
will be coming out for ps4 you know as

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.220 
will be coming out for ps4 you know as
of<00:02:44.370> late<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.610> don't<00:02:44.880> think<00:02:45.060> GTA<00:02:45.360> 5<00:02:45.630> will<00:02:46.140> be

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
of late I don't think GTA 5 will be

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
of late I don't think GTA 5 will be
coming<00:02:46.410> out<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.770> ps4<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.060> near<00:02:48.390> future

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
coming out for ps4 in the near future

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.830 
coming out for ps4 in the near future
because<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:50.070> don't<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.210> seems<00:02:51.480> like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
because I don't know it just seems like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320 
because I don't know it just seems like
there's<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> lot<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.560> coding<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.400> scripting<00:02:54.209> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
there's a lot of coding and scripting to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.210 
there's a lot of coding and scripting to
be<00:02:54.450> done<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.110> game<00:02:55.380> by<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.620> looks<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.100> it

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
be done in the game by the looks of it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
be done in the game by the looks of it
and<00:02:56.510> yeah<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> don't<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:57.930> we're<00:02:58.020> gonna<00:02:58.080> be

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and yeah I don't think we're gonna be

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.920 
and yeah I don't think we're gonna be
seeing<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.560> too<00:02:58.830> soon<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.910> yet<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:00.510> might<00:03:00.750> be

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
seeing this too soon but yet we might be

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.330 
seeing this too soon but yet we might be
seeing<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.260> soon<00:03:01.290> obviously<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> can't<00:03:02.190> tell

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
seeing it soon obviously I can't tell

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
seeing it soon obviously I can't tell
the<00:03:02.459> future<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:03.060> yeah<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.540> don't<00:03:03.930> think<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
the future but yeah I don't think that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.320 
the future but yeah I don't think that
we're<00:03:04.320> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.530> seeing<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.830> ps4<00:03:05.330> version

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
we're going to be seeing the ps4 version

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.699 
we're going to be seeing the ps4 version
of<00:03:06.390> GTA<00:03:06.540> 5<00:03:06.810> too<00:03:06.990> soon<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.260> pretty<00:03:07.440> sure<00:03:07.590> it's

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
of GTA 5 too soon and pretty sure it's

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.310 
of GTA 5 too soon and pretty sure it's
in<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.920> code<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.940> they<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.050> want<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
in the code because they just want to

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.440 
in the code because they just want to
get<00:03:10.380> into<00:03:10.530> code<00:03:10.830> early<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.180> not

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
get into code early so they have to not
