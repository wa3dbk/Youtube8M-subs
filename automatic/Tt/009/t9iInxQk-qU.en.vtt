00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
RAM b-note tim is pretty good he can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.940 
RAM b-note tim is pretty good he can
break<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> down<00:01:38.780> yeah<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:39.990> Jeff<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
break it down yeah I think Jeff is is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.950 
break it down yeah I think Jeff is is
probably<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.460> mean<00:01:41.820> Duran<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> prod<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> best

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
probably I mean Duran is prod the best

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
probably I mean Duran is prod the best
lightweight<00:01:43.409> heaven<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.970> 135<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.170> no<00:01:46.369> they

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
lightweight heaven and 135 with no they

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
lightweight heaven and 135 with no they
look<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:48.409> champions<00:01:49.409> were<00:01:49.710> struggling

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
look like champions were struggling

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.249 
look like champions were struggling
they're<00:01:50.399> dead<00:01:50.549> weight<00:01:50.700> class<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.780> he

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
they're dead weight class so I think he

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.910 
they're dead weight class so I think he
would<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.680> feet<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.399> fight<00:01:54.920> BJ

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
would have got feet up in that fight BJ

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
would have got feet up in that fight BJ
what's<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> got<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.909> win<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.360> he

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
what's up I got I got the win I think he

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.190 
what's up I got I got the win I think he
would<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.719> been<00:02:00.899> too<00:02:01.020> much<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.579> it<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> way

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
would have been too much for it that way

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.940 
would have been too much for it that way
you<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.320> bring<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.560> down

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you and bring it down

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
you and bring it down
I<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:06.689> think<00:02:06.840> he<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.170> bit<00:02:07.259> too<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
I just think he little bit too much for

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.369 
I just think he little bit too much for
me<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.239> seen<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> lot<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> similarities<00:02:10.349> in

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
