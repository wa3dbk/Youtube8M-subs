00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
you what it looks like on a hockey stick
soon<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.390> compare<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> park

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
soon I'm just gonna compare it to a park

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
soon I'm just gonna compare it to a park
regulation<00:01:38.009> hockey<00:01:38.280> puck<00:01:38.460> should<00:01:38.820> weigh<00:01:38.970> 6

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
regulation hockey puck should weigh 6

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
regulation hockey puck should weigh 6
ounces<00:01:39.600> put<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> says<00:01:41.340> five

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
ounces put that on there so it says five

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
ounces put that on there so it says five
point<00:01:41.850> eight<00:01:41.909> ounces<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.540> close<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> six

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
point eight ounces pretty close to six

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.609 
point eight ounces pretty close to six
then<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.399> hockshop<00:01:44.880> weight<00:01:45.619> weighs

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
then we have the hockshop weight weighs

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.460 
then we have the hockshop weight weighs
in<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.950> 5.1<00:01:47.729> Alice's<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.390> similar<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.110> weight

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in at 5.1 Alice's so similar in weight

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
in at 5.1 Alice's so similar in weight
to<00:01:49.890> having<00:01:50.579> another<00:01:50.790> hockey<00:01:51.149> puck<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.600> your

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
doesn't look like that's really moving

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.510 
doesn't look like that's really moving
I'll<00:02:20.020> take<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.320> few<00:02:20.500> snapshots<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> little

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
I'll take a few snapshots do a little

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.560 
I'll take a few snapshots do a little
bit<00:02:21.640> stake<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.940> see<00:02:22.210> if<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.420> get<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
bit stake and see if I can get that

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.270 
bit stake and see if I can get that
thing<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.840> move<00:02:22.960> around<00:02:23.110> I'm<00:02:23.740> inside<00:02:24.100> right

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
thing to move around I'm inside right

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.680 
thing to move around I'm inside right
now<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> can't<00:02:24.880> leave<00:02:25.000> shoot<00:02:25.240> pucks<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.700 
show you guys what this looks like but I
just<00:02:27.250> tested<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> bit<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.660> no<00:02:29.170> problems<00:02:29.590> at

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
just tested it a bit and no problems at

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.750 
just tested it a bit and no problems at
all<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.100> I'll<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.340> give<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.640> little

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
all so I'll just give you a little

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.510 
all so I'll just give you a little
example<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:32.950> me<00:02:33.130> shaking

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
example here so that's just me shaking

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520 
example here so that's just me shaking
it<00:02:33.610> back<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.940> forth<00:02:34.150> no<00:02:34.240> movement<00:02:34.810> for

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it back and forth no movement for

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.040 
it back and forth no movement for
snapshot<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.980> even<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.820> push<00:02:40.570> down<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:40.840> it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
snapshot and even if I push down on it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.010 
snapshot and even if I push down on it
really<00:02:41.650> hard<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.970> moves<00:02:43.210> just<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.750> little

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
really hard here it moves just a little

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.840 
really hard here it moves just a little
bit<00:02:44.140> but<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.530> really<00:02:45.070> have<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> force<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.730> like

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
bit but you really have to force it like

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.330 
bit but you really have to force it like
I'm<00:02:45.940> trying<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> pull<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> back<00:02:46.900> here<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.380> it's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I'm trying to pull it back here and it's

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.940 
I'm trying to pull it back here and it's
not<00:02:48.520> really<00:02:48.760> moving<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:50.200> foam<00:02:50.470> pads<00:02:50.710> on

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
not really moving so the foam pads on

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.150 
not really moving so the foam pads on
there<00:02:51.070> they<00:02:51.490> really<00:02:51.940> grip<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> stick<00:02:52.810> nicely

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
there they really grip the stick nicely

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.560 
there they really grip the stick nicely
what<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.400> about<00:02:54.550> this<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.970> not<00:02:55.150> too<00:02:55.330> bulky

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
what I like about this is not too bulky

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.890 
what I like about this is not too bulky
so<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.590> don't<00:02:56.710> really<00:02:56.800> feel<00:02:57.330> some<00:02:58.330> bulky

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
so it you don't really feel some bulky

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.720 
so it you don't really feel some bulky
sort<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.650> doesn't<00:02:59.920> feel<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> place<00:03:00.490> or

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
sort of it doesn't feel out of place or

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.260 
sort of it doesn't feel out of place or
anything<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
anything like that

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.700 
anything like that
just<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.810> little<00:03:01.960> bit<00:03:02.050> of<00:03:02.110> extra<00:03:02.290> weight<00:03:02.500> which

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
just a little bit of extra weight which

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.320 
just a little bit of extra weight which
is<00:03:02.740> nice<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.490> doesn't<00:03:03.730> move<00:03:03.850> around<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.210> off

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
is nice it doesn't move around it off

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.510

a few things that I liked about it it's
very<00:03:22.420> slim<00:03:22.750> design<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.590> fits<00:03:23.860> really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
it's not sticking out so it's not

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.800

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
you're the weight you normally would be

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.580 
you're the weight you normally would be
on<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.130> shaft<00:03:30.540> that's<00:03:31.540> very<00:03:31.959> nice<00:03:32.110> also<00:03:32.380> you

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
on the shaft that's very nice also you

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.260 
on the shaft that's very nice also you
put<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.860> anywhere<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.370> say<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.670> get<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.910> second

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
put it anywhere so say you get a second

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.090 
put it anywhere so say you get a second
one<00:03:34.360> like<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.810> right<00:03:34.900> here<00:03:34.989> say<00:03:35.950> this

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
one like this one right here say this

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.620 
one like this one right here say this
one<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.340> worth<00:03:36.520> five<00:03:36.790> point<00:03:37.060> one<00:03:37.209> ounces<00:03:37.510> you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
one is worth five point one ounces you

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.510 
one is worth five point one ounces you
want<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> add<00:03:37.989> under<00:03:38.230> five<00:03:38.500> ounces<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.400> can

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
want to add under five ounces you can

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.130 
want to add under five ounces you can
put<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:39.730> one<00:03:39.910> somewhere<00:03:40.239> in<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.420> middle<00:03:40.720> or

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
put this one somewhere in the middle or

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.050 
put this one somewhere in the middle or
maybe<00:03:41.350> close<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> top<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.760> would<00:03:42.880> sort

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
maybe close to the top and I would sort

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.610 
maybe close to the top and I would sort
of<00:03:43.120> balance<00:03:43.480> out<00:03:43.600> where<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.050> weight<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.260> on

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
of balance out where the weight is on

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.560 
of balance out where the weight is on
the<00:03:44.770> shaft<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.910> kind<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.209> get<00:03:46.390> that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
the shaft so you can kind of get that

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.120 
the shaft so you can kind of get that
feel<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.350> like<00:03:47.530> by<00:03:47.739> putting<00:03:47.770> that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
feel that you like by putting that

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.060 
feel that you like by putting that
weight<00:03:48.370> anywhere<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.270> want<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.470> compared<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
weight anywhere you want and compared to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.340 
weight anywhere you want and compared to
the<00:03:51.160> other<00:03:51.280> stick<00:03:51.970> weights<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.420> kind<00:03:53.170> of<00:03:53.200> like

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
the other stick weights I kind of like

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.150 
the other stick weights I kind of like
this<00:03:53.590> one<00:03:53.770> better

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
this one better

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.920 
this one better
number<00:03:54.820> one<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.090> more<00:03:55.209> affordable

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
number one it's more affordable

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.770 
number one it's more affordable
frugal<00:03:56.290> guy<00:03:56.439> so<00:03:56.980> it's<00:03:57.400> only<00:03:57.700> about<00:03:57.879> $12<00:03:58.569> on

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
frugal guy so it's only about $12 on

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.470 
frugal guy so it's only about $12 on
hockey<00:03:59.049> calm<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.920> think<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.299> most

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
hockey calm I think it is the most

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.569 
hockey calm I think it is the most
affordable<00:04:01.780> stick<00:04:02.170> weight<00:04:02.379> also<00:04:03.099> I<00:04:03.129> like<00:04:03.400> that

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
affordable stick weight also I like that

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.490 
affordable stick weight also I like that
the<00:04:03.670> weights<00:04:03.879> are<00:04:04.090> all<00:04:04.120> sewn<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.689> there<00:04:04.870> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
the weights are all sewn in there the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.780 
the weights are all sewn in there the
one<00:04:05.620> disadvantage<00:04:05.799> there<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.549> can't

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
one disadvantage there is you can't

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.130 
one disadvantage there is you can't
interchange<00:04:07.090> them<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:07.629> you<00:04:07.719> can't<00:04:07.930> take<00:04:08.109> a

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
interchange them so you can't take a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.660 
interchange them so you can't take a
little<00:04:08.379> bit<00:04:08.469> a<00:04:08.590> weight<00:04:08.799> out<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.280> put<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> little

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
little bit a weight out or put a little

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.309 
little bit a weight out or put a little
more<00:04:09.849> weight<00:04:10.090> in<00:04:10.269> but<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.780> kind<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.200> would

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
more weight in but I kind of would

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.809 
more weight in but I kind of would
prefer<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.890> them<00:04:12.010> sewn<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.400> there<00:04:12.549> so

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
prefer to have them sewn in there so

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.399 
prefer to have them sewn in there so
they<00:04:13.239> won't<00:04:13.329> be<00:04:13.480> flying<00:04:13.719> or<00:04:14.049> moving<00:04:14.349> around

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
they won't be flying or moving around

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.680 
they won't be flying or moving around
inside<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.730> that's<00:04:15.849> one<00:04:16.000> advantage<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.419> it

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
inside so that's one advantage to it

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.170 
inside so that's one advantage to it
also<00:04:17.079> it's<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:18.039> a<00:04:18.250> lot<00:04:18.519> of<00:04:18.549> weight<00:04:18.850> it's<00:04:18.970> five

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
also it's not a lot of weight it's five

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.689 
also it's not a lot of weight it's five
ounces<00:04:19.600> five<00:04:20.350> point<00:04:20.560> one<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.160> if<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.430> want

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
ounces five point one so if you want

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.890 
ounces five point one so if you want
more<00:04:21.970> weight<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.180> can<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.479> grab<00:04:22.780> another

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
more weight you can just grab another

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.300 
more weight you can just grab another
little<00:04:23.259> pad<00:04:23.410> like<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:23.979> stick<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.220> on

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
little pad like this and stick it on

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.219 
little pad like this and stick it on
there<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.669> they're<00:04:24.789> fairly<00:04:24.940> cheap<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.509> pretty

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
there and they're fairly cheap so pretty

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.499 
there and they're fairly cheap so pretty
affordable<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.710> do<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.009> also<00:04:27.759> compared<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
affordable to do that also compared to

affordable to do that also compared to
the<00:04:28.570> more<00:04:28.840> expensive<00:04:29.080> stick<00:04:29.440> weights<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:30.340> go

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
the more expensive stick weights that go

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.029

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
expensive and also the weight

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.439 
expensive and also the weight
distribution<00:04:35.949> is<00:04:36.490> kind<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.759> felt<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.090> bit<00:04:37.210> funny

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449
