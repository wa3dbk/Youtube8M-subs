00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.759
 despite pending battlefield 3 release 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.639
 on march 17 ea and dice work on 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.289
 further updates for battlefield 4 night 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.150
 version of several battlefield 4 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.379
 Maps are planned and some of them 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.250
 are already on the testserver 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.990
 available 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.430
 we played and delivered these 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.690
 our impression to the changed 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.690
 play in the dark 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.100
 Battlefield 4 at light off the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.379
 magnificent grasslands of the 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.260
 Chinese Golmud Lhasa railway connection 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.180
 provided for the map golmud railway for 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.340
 hearty butchery with focus on 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.020
 heavy vehicles now before 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.200
 prevailing darkness envelops the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.730
 landscape in view of consuming black 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.230
 sniper annoys that very special 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.910
 from the settlement in the upper part of the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.680
 map is the good overview now 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.989
 lost except one is natural 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.940
 prepared and uses night vision 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.899
 However, the essays are not strong 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.260
 zoom are usable 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.140
 the mvs really in just so usable 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 here at least 25 is included 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.750
 far from practical in the dark 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.750
 as her nv 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.190
 the card was 311 at night for 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.960
 dark gloomy forest of winning 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.660
 atmosphere speaks for the night cards 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.820
 Immediately 311 is a good example of this 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.830
 at cards with architectural requirements 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.080
 short sight affects that very much 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.330
 atmospheric at ours 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.770
 Trial tried out at a art 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.850
 to detect fog in a short distance 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.320
 which drastically reduced the visibility 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.420
 From the helicopter you can see the trees 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.640
 which we from a kind of fog sea 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.410
 stand out the focus of the fighting 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.380
 thus shifts automatically to the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.690
 air to dogfight but how is it now 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.800
 is there a playful added value 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.830
 you can get to the night cards 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.210
 graphically already look forward 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.680
 playfully considering 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.270
 it just looks wonderful when the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.770
 through the air ballistic correct 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.869
 almost rushing bullets 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.050
 artistically touched light cool 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.819
 mission explosion explosion effects one 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.140
 especially with the right one 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.440
 graphics card and at high 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 graphic settings 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.480
 however, the gameplay does not change 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.990
 massive at least not in the normal game 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 mode 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.200
 Often the opponents are good despite the darkness 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.060
 recognizable 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 already tagged by team buddies or 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.640
 flashing wild on the minimap in hardcore 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.110
 However, game mode should be dark 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.910
 become clear game changer 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.350
 at the current time was the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.130
 hardcore mode at night unfortunately 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.840
 not playable 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.450
 the evidence for the said assumption 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.370
 So it's still out anyway will be daily 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.290
 a text version screwed and ours 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.930
 first impression mainly refers to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.000
 a snapshot of clearly to 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.740
 appearing moon in our video 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.320
 Material only became available hours later 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.120
 not completely removed yet 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.890
 all light sources can be switched off and dozens 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.420
 other bugs exist that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.250
 development team continues to employ 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.660
 become 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.980
 when the night cards in the final 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.900
 written on the public servers 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.520
 to appear is unclear 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
 There is definitely some fine tuning 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.740
 but it is necessary in principle 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.420
 a nice idea and bring a little 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.430
 Variation in the except for a few 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 Exceptions of glorious sunny 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.140
 sunshine dominated battlefields
