but I wanted something I'd be able to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.640 
but I wanted something I'd be able to
customize<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:02.390> enter<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
customize so enter this this is a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.490 
customize so enter this this is a
laser-cut<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.150> mantic<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.260> offer

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
laser-cut one now mantic does offer

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.310 
laser-cut one now mantic does offer
their<00:01:10.830> own<00:01:10.979> laser<00:01:11.340> cut<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:13.140> would<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
their own laser cut one this would be

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.030 
their own laser cut one this would be
kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> my<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.760> guess<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
kind of my take on that I guess the the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
kind of my take on that I guess the the
board<00:01:17.250> itself<00:01:17.810> normally<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:18.930> come<00:01:19.110> with

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
board itself normally would come with

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.390 
board itself normally would come with
wood<00:01:19.680> inserts<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.070> scoring

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
wood inserts so for the for your scoring

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
wood inserts so for the for your scoring
zones<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.360> example<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
zones this would be an example of one of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.710 
zones this would be an example of one of
them<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.000> these<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.060> actually

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
them that I did and these are actually

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
them that I did and these are actually
custom<00:01:28.259> engraved<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.829> team<00:01:29.100> names<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.820> there

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
custom engraved with team names so there

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
custom engraved with team names so there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.280 
in all wood it'll also be available in
all<00:01:58.229> acrylic<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.930> you're<00:02:01.049> wanting<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
all acrylic so if you're wanting to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.880 
all acrylic so if you're wanting to
paint<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:01.920> paint<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:04.110> kid

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
paint it or not paint as you can the kid

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.050 
paint it or not paint as you can the kid
is<00:02:04.920> modular<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.880> actually

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is modular and that it's actually

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789 
is modular and that it's actually
multiple<00:02:06.719> pieces<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> center

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
multiple pieces so you have a center

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.820 
multiple pieces so you have a center
section<00:02:08.209> two<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.810> type<00:02:10.379> sections

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
section two of these in type sections

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.020 
section two of these in type sections
and<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.069> you're<00:02:11.819> scoring<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and then you're scoring and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.720 
and then you're scoring and
tune<00:02:13.780> your<00:02:13.810> scoring<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.560> your<00:02:15.010> turn<00:02:15.400> counter

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
tune your scoring and your turn counter

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.730 
tune your scoring and your turn counter
sections<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:16.959> away<00:02:17.230> all<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> pieces

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
sections so that away all the pieces

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.380 
sections so that away all the pieces
even<00:02:18.370> though<00:02:18.430> I've<00:02:18.550> got<00:02:18.580> them<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.120> taped

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
even though I've got them here taped

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
even though I've got them here taped
together<00:02:19.680> said<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.770> don't<00:02:20.830> bump<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.400> table<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
together said I don't bump the table and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.110 
together said I don't bump the table and
those<00:02:21.910> sorts<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> things<00:02:23.790> all<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> pieces

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
those sorts of things all the pieces

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.540 
those sorts of things all the pieces
will<00:02:25.330> fit<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.690> original<00:02:26.020> box<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.250> way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
will fit in the original box so that way

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.160 
will fit in the original box so that way
if<00:02:27.640> you're<00:02:27.760> storing<00:02:28.120> yours<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.569> box<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.930> can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
if you're storing yours in a box you can

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
if you're storing yours in a box you can
or<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.860> you're<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.700> me<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.720> put

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
or if you're like me and you put

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.030 
or if you're like me and you put
everything<00:02:31.959> in<00:02:32.230> foam<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:32.950> really

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
everything in foam and you don't really

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.979 
everything in foam and you don't really
have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.250> very<00:02:33.550> big<00:02:33.910> foam<00:02:34.180> bag<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.810> team

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
have a very big foam bag for your team

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:35.880 
have a very big foam bag for your team
because<00:02:35.140> your<00:02:35.230> team<00:02:35.350> doesn't<00:02:35.500> take<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> lot<00:02:35.830> of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
because your team doesn't take a lot of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.949 
because your team doesn't take a lot of
space<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:37.030> would<00:02:37.150> allow<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.540> fit<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.810> all

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
space this would allow you to fit it all

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.430 
space this would allow you to fit it all
into<00:02:38.230> one<00:02:38.319> small<00:02:38.739> space<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.459> really<00:02:39.819> nice

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
into one small space it's really nice

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160 
into one small space it's really nice
but<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:42.580> idea<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> board<00:02:43.330> was<00:02:43.540> besides

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
but the idea what the board was besides

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.740 
but the idea what the board was besides
having<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.709> regular<00:02:45.239> hexes<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.360> also<00:02:46.510> did

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
having just the regular hexes I also did

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.870 
having just the regular hexes I also did
a<00:02:46.780> little<00:02:47.019> bit<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> an<00:02:47.320> inset<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.610> little

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
a little bit of an inset to the little

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.000 
a little bit of an inset to the little
engraved<00:02:49.239> lip<00:02:49.989> let<00:02:50.350> me<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.830> zoom

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
engraved lip let me see if I can zoom

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.199 
engraved lip let me see if I can zoom
down<00:02:51.220> into<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:51.940> see<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
down into that so you can see it a

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.440 
down into that so you can see it a
little<00:02:52.269> bit<00:02:52.480> better<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:55.000> as<00:02:55.180> close<00:02:55.390> as

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
little bit better and that's as close as

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.520 
little bit better and that's as close as
I<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.660> get<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.019> we're<00:02:56.140> going<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.320> have<00:02:56.350> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
I can get so we're going to have to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.880 
I can get so we're going to have to
bring<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.489> camera<00:02:58.030> closer<00:02:59.069> so<00:03:01.739> there<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:02.950> go

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
bring the camera closer so there we go

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.290 
bring the camera closer so there we go
there<00:03:05.890> all<00:03:06.519> right<00:03:06.700> should<00:03:06.910> show<00:03:07.030> up<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> little

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
there all right should show up a little

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.009 
there all right should show up a little
bit<00:03:07.390> better<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:08.050> there's<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.319> little<00:03:08.769> engraved

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
bit better but there's a little engraved

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.080 
bit better but there's a little engraved
little<00:03:11.019> engraved<00:03:11.319> section<00:03:11.739> right<00:03:11.860> there<00:03:12.090> what

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
little engraved section right there what

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.759 
little engraved section right there what
that<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:13.959> just<00:03:14.200> give<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> little<00:03:14.590> bit

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
that is is to just give it a little bit

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.900 
that is is to just give it a little bit
more<00:03:14.890> character<00:03:15.160> than<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> flat

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
more character than just the flat

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.330 
more character than just the flat
squares<00:03:16.239> now<00:03:17.170> some<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.769> early<00:03:18.070> ones<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
squares now some of the early ones I

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.970 
squares now some of the early ones I
showed<00:03:18.370> had<00:03:18.910> even<00:03:19.269> more<00:03:19.480> texture<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.290> they're

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
showed had even more texture and they're

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.800 
showed had even more texture and they're
available<00:03:21.220> also<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.700> fact<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:23.220> mean<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> one

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
available also in fact I mean this one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.600 
available also in fact I mean this one
this<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.019> larger<00:03:26.500> bore<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.250> did<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
this is a larger bore that I did but you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.970 
this is a larger bore that I did but you
can<00:03:27.700> see<00:03:27.850> it's<00:03:27.970> got<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.120> nice<00:03:28.650> texture<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.860> is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
can see it's got a nice texture this is

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.759 
can see it's got a nice texture this is
one<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.250> I'm<00:03:30.310> still<00:03:30.489> painting<00:03:30.880> on<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:32.500> once<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
one that I'm still painting on so once I

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.190 
one that I'm still painting on so once I
get<00:03:32.890> this<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.130> completed<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.640> painted

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
get this one completed and painted

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.330 
get this one completed and painted
you'll<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.410> see<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.739> it'll<00:03:35.890> you'll

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340

you'll get to see it and it'll you'll
get<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.519> see<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.820> his<00:03:36.970> tire<00:03:37.269> tea<00:03:37.450> but<00:03:37.600> this

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
get to see it in his tire tea but this

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.979 
get to see it in his tire tea but this
was<00:03:37.930> kind<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.500> prototype<00:03:38.950> one<00:03:39.989> that

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
was kind of the prototype one that

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:41.880 
was kind of the prototype one that
particular<00:03:41.350> one<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.620> one<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.799> I'm

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
particular one is the one that I'm

yes<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.740> know<00:05:23.770> there<00:05:24.070> is<00:05:24.100> six<00:05:24.460> there<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:25.090> you

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
yes I know there is six there and you

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.850 
yes I know there is six there and you
only<00:05:25.270> need<00:05:25.450> five<00:05:25.630> for<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:25.900> game<00:05:26.080> I<00:05:26.260> did<00:05:26.410> extras

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
only need five for the game I did extras

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.140 
only need five for the game I did extras
actually<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.370> set<00:05:27.580> I<00:05:27.610> think<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.030> will<00:05:28.090> be

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
actually in the set I think it will be

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.770 
actually in the set I think it will be
either<00:05:28.480> eight<00:05:28.810> or<00:05:28.840> ten<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:31.330> come<00:05:31.540> with<00:05:31.750> it

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
either eight or ten that come with it

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.660 
either eight or ten that come with it
I'm<00:05:31.990> still<00:05:32.230> figuring<00:05:32.830> out<00:05:33.040> how<00:05:33.190> much<00:05:33.310> slack

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
I'm still figuring out how much slack

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.780 
I'm still figuring out how much slack
space<00:05:33.910> i<00:05:34.030> have<00:05:34.210> on<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:35.460> cut<00:05:36.460> when<00:05:36.610> i<00:05:36.640> go

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
space i have on the on the cut when i go

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.400 
space i have on the on the cut when i go
to<00:05:36.820> do<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.810> main<00:05:37.960> reason<00:05:37.990> for<00:05:38.230> the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
to do it and the main reason for the

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.170 
to do it and the main reason for the
extras<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.830> you're<00:05:39.070> going<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.250> lose<00:05:39.370> one<00:05:39.640> you

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
extras is you're going to lose one you

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.880 
extras is you're going to lose one you
may<00:05:40.330> lose<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.780> this<00:05:41.050> way<00:05:41.230> you're<00:05:41.440> covered<00:05:41.800> and

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
may lose to this way you're covered and

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.980 
may lose to this way you're covered and
you<00:05:41.950> have<00:05:42.100> some<00:05:42.280> extras<00:05:42.670> extras<00:05:43.510> are<00:05:43.750> always

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
you have some extras extras are always

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.260 
you have some extras extras are always
good<00:05:44.170> but<00:05:45.010> this<00:05:45.460> is<00:05:45.640> kind<00:05:45.850> of<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.000> entire

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
so that's really it for this one for now

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.140 
so that's really it for this one for now
there<00:06:27.010> are<00:06:27.160> a<00:06:27.190> few<00:06:27.400> additional<00:06:27.700> pieces<00:06:27.910> that

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
there are a few additional pieces that

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.580 
there are a few additional pieces that
will<00:06:28.210> be<00:06:28.300> going<00:06:28.420> with<00:06:28.690> this<00:06:28.840> set<00:06:29.110> such<00:06:29.380> as

easier to cut number 2 I don't know
necessarily<00:06:59.039> if<00:06:59.490> I<00:06:59.580> like<00:06:59.910> having<00:07:00.690> that

color<00:07:08.970> or<00:07:09.210> do<00:07:09.389> something<00:07:09.600> different<00:07:10.020> with<00:07:10.050> it

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 
color or do something different with it

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.010 
color or do something different with it
and<00:07:10.440> that<00:07:11.070> gives<00:07:11.220> them<00:07:11.310> kind<00:07:11.520> of<00:07:11.580> an<00:07:11.669> option<00:07:12.020> as

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
and that gives them kind of an option as

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.510 
and that gives them kind of an option as
always<00:07:13.410> it's<00:07:13.590> all<00:07:13.680> about<00:07:13.860> the<00:07:13.979> options<00:07:14.100> but

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
always it's all about the options but

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.640 
always it's all about the options but
this<00:07:14.699> is<00:07:14.910> this<00:07:15.810> one<00:07:16.050> of<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.229> designs<00:07:16.530> that

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
this is this one of the designs that

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.140 
this is this one of the designs that
we're<00:07:16.800> going<00:07:16.889> to<00:07:16.949> have<00:07:17.190> there<00:07:17.850> will<00:07:18.030> be

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
we're going to have there will be

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.960 
we're going to have there will be
multiple<00:07:18.330> designs<00:07:18.780> for<00:07:19.530> the<00:07:19.560> pitch<00:07:20.250> itself<00:07:20.580> so

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
multiple designs for the pitch itself so

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.490 
multiple designs for the pitch itself so
like<00:07:21.360> for<00:07:21.510> example<00:07:21.570> you<00:07:21.930> have<00:07:21.960> the<00:07:22.139> deck<00:07:22.289> plate

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
like for example you have the deck plate

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.230 
like for example you have the deck plate
one<00:07:22.620> that<00:07:22.770> I<00:07:22.830> showed<00:07:22.860> you<00:07:23.070> in<00:07:23.250> the<00:07:23.280> silver<00:07:23.669> this

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
one that I showed you in the silver this

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.960 
one that I showed you in the silver this
one<00:07:24.419> is<00:07:24.630> just<00:07:24.660> a<00:07:25.050> smooth<00:07:25.289> finish<00:07:25.500> one<00:07:25.970> there

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
one is just a smooth finish one there

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.879 
one is just a smooth finish one there
may<00:07:27.210> be<00:07:27.240> additional<00:07:27.419> others<00:07:27.960> if<00:07:28.139> you<00:07:28.410> have<00:07:28.770> an

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
may be additional others if you have an

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.070 
may be additional others if you have an
idea<00:07:29.250> for<00:07:29.310> one<00:07:29.669> let<00:07:30.000> us<00:07:30.120> know<00:07:30.300> we<00:07:30.750> can<00:07:30.840> probably

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 
idea for one let us know we can probably

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.560 
idea for one let us know we can probably
put<00:07:31.199> it<00:07:31.260> into<00:07:31.440> a<00:07:31.470> product<00:07:31.849> anyway<00:07:32.849> that's

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:33.570 
put it into a product anyway that's

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.889 
put it into a product anyway that's
really<00:07:33.810> it<00:07:33.900> for<00:07:34.020> now<00:07:34.169> talk<00:07:34.620> to<00:07:34.680> you<00:07:34.770> guys<00:07:34.800> later
