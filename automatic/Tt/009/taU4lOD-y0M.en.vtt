00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
discovered his transit time was only

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
discovered his transit time was only
nine<00:00:15.960> hours<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.590> he's<00:00:16.920> not<00:00:17.039> holding<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
nine hours which he's not holding the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
nine hours which he's not holding the
food<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.940> his<00:00:18.090> system<00:00:18.390> long<00:00:18.600> enough<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.990> get

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
food in his system long enough to get

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.670 
food in his system long enough to get
the<00:00:19.230> nutrients<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.439> really

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the nutrients out of it and and I really

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.250 
the nutrients out of it and and I really
thought<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> said<00:00:24.330> before<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.019> could

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
thought what I said before was you could

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.870 
thought what I said before was you could
have<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> inflammation<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.699> gut

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
have a lot of inflammation in your gut

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599 
have a lot of inflammation in your gut
which<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.240> still<00:00:27.510> could<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.740> let's<00:00:29.460> go

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
which you still could have but let's go

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
which you still could have but let's go
further<00:00:29.820> north<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.810> look<00:00:31.019> at<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
further north and look at what the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
further north and look at what the
causes<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.070> inflammation<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
causes that inflammation is the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.040 
causes that inflammation is the
inability<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.290> digest<00:00:34.649> foods<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.899> one<00:00:36.899> of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
inability to digest foods and one of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
inability to digest foods and one of
those<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.710> being<00:00:38.250> hypochloride<00:00:39.059> Rick<00:00:39.239> which

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
those is being hypochloride Rick which

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
those is being hypochloride Rick which
means<00:00:39.690> you're<00:00:40.170> not<00:00:40.260> making<00:00:40.590> enough

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
means you're not making enough

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.310 
means you're not making enough
hydrochloric<00:00:41.370> acid<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.239> break<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.750> proteins

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
hydrochloric acid to break down proteins

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560 
hydrochloric acid to break down proteins
and<00:00:43.559> enough<00:00:44.219> pancreatic<00:00:44.760> enzymes<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.539> digest

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and enough pancreatic enzymes to digest

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.190 
and enough pancreatic enzymes to digest
food<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> small<00:00:46.710> intestine<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.170> one<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
food in the small intestine so one of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.420 
food in the small intestine so one of
the<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.590> I'd<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.920> add<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> your

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a lot of the northern part of your

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
a lot of the northern part of your
digestion<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.119> part<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.479> influences<00:01:52.079> your

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
digestion the part that influences your

liver gallbladder the part that
influences<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> pancreas<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.500> let's<00:01:55.680> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
influences the pancreas so let's just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
influences the pancreas so let's just
stay<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.700> before<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.299> go<00:01:57.450> further

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
stay right there before we go further

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.149 
stay right there before we go further
south<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> start<00:01:58.530> trying<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> whole

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
south and start trying to do a whole

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.590 
south and start trying to do a whole
bunch<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> supplements<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> that's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
bunch of supplements for that that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.459 
bunch of supplements for that that's
that's<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.840> idea<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:07.079> hydras

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that's my idea for you and the hydras

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.320 
that's my idea for you and the hydras
I'm<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.119> would<00:02:09.270> take

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
I'm what you would do is you would take

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.650 
I'm what you would do is you would take
four<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> six<00:02:09.959> per<00:02:10.560> meal<00:02:11.450> depending<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.540> how

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
four to six per meal depending on how

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.090 
four to six per meal depending on how
much<00:02:12.780> protein<00:02:13.230> you're<00:02:13.440> eating

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
much protein you're eating

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.070 
much protein you're eating
there's<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.190> whole<00:02:15.400> caveat<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:15.970> how<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> find

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
there's a whole caveat to how to find

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.840 
there's a whole caveat to how to find
out<00:02:17.260> how<00:02:17.470> much<00:02:17.650> hydrochloric<00:02:18.490> acid<00:02:18.760> you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
out how much hydrochloric acid you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.400 
out how much hydrochloric acid you
really<00:02:19.120> need<00:02:19.300> if<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.660> really<00:02:19.990> wanted<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.290> get

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
really need if you really wanted to get

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.410 
really need if you really wanted to get
into<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.490> can<00:02:21.700> go<00:02:21.820> over<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.210> but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
into that and we can go over that but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.480 
into that and we can go over that but
another<00:02:22.930> safe<00:02:23.200> way<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.130> four<00:02:24.400> to

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
another safe way to do it is do four to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.080 
another safe way to do it is do four to
six<00:02:24.730> tablets<00:02:26.160> every<00:02:27.160> meal<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.730> should<00:02:27.970> be

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
six tablets every meal and you should be

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.820 
six tablets every meal and you should be
eating<00:02:28.270> three<00:02:28.570> meals<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:29.080> this<00:02:29.260> control<00:02:29.650> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
eating three meals on this control it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.460 
eating three meals on this control it
besides<00:02:30.310> your<00:02:30.490> two<00:02:30.670> drinks<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:32.140> would<00:02:32.290> be

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
besides your two drinks so that would be

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.740 
besides your two drinks so that would be
you<00:02:32.860> know<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.070> least<00:02:33.250> minimum<00:02:33.700> 12<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.180> day<00:02:34.210> for

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
you know at least minimum 12 a day for

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.200 
you know at least minimum 12 a day for
each<00:02:34.960> meal<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:36.820> that's<00:02:36.970> going<00:02:37.120> to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
each meal and I think that's going to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.670 
each meal and I think that's going to
improve<00:02:37.600> things<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> great<00:02:39.040> deal

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
improve things for you a great deal

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620 
improve things for you a great deal
questions<00:02:41.680> okay

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
questions okay

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.870 
questions okay
the<00:02:44.140> other<00:02:44.290> thing<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.310> Nutri<00:02:45.670> clear

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the other thing is the Nutri clear

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.240 
the other thing is the Nutri clear
that's<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.540> controller<00:02:46.930> program<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.800> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that's on the controller program is a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.160 
that's on the controller program is a
Liberty<00:02:48.880> talk<00:02:49.120> sir<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.600> also<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.870> gut

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
Liberty talk sir but it's also a gut

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.920 
Liberty talk sir but it's also a gut
healer<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.700> already<00:02:51.910> really<00:02:52.750> have

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
healer so we already really have

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.360 
healer so we already really have
something<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.410> your<00:02:53.530> protocol<00:02:54.040> that's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
something in your protocol that's

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.490 
something in your protocol that's
addressing<00:02:54.790> inflammation<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:56.110> nutria

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
addressing inflammation that nutria

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.230 
addressing inflammation that nutria

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
toxic bowel issues so what I would do is

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.750 
toxic bowel issues so what I would do is
walk<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> really<00:03:11.470> fine<00:03:11.740> line<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.310> instead<00:03:12.640> of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
walk a really fine line and instead of

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.540 
walk a really fine line and instead of
you<00:03:12.970> doing<00:03:13.210> a<00:03:13.510> half<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.200> scoop<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.830> your<00:03:14.890> nutria

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
you doing a half of scoop of your nutria

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.630 
you doing a half of scoop of your nutria
clear<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:17.200> midday<00:03:17.470> snacks<00:03:18.040> or<00:03:18.400> your

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
clear at your to midday snacks or your

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.970 
clear at your to midday snacks or your
mid-morning<00:03:19.000> mid-afternoon<00:03:19.300> snack<00:03:19.980> however

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
mid-morning mid-afternoon snack however

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.290 
mid-morning mid-afternoon snack however
that<00:03:21.100> works<00:03:21.310> out<00:03:21.459> for<00:03:21.670> your<00:03:21.820> long<00:03:22.030> days

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
that works out for your long days

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.449 
that works out for your long days
instead<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.290> doing<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.680> half<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.010> scoop<00:03:24.220> let's

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
instead of doing a half a scoop let's

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.449 
instead of doing a half a scoop let's
increase<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.300> one<00:03:25.540> full<00:03:25.840> scoop<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.250> that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
increase it to one full scoop so that

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.120 
increase it to one full scoop so that
would<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.730> two<00:03:27.940> scoops<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.510> day<00:03:28.720> overall<00:03:29.590> and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
would be two scoops a day overall and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.680 
would be two scoops a day overall and
that<00:03:30.310> actually<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:30.970> protocol<00:03:31.630> for

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
that actually is the protocol for

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.960 
that actually is the protocol for
healing<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.320> gut<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.010> we've<00:03:33.310> got<00:03:33.520> everything

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
healing the gut so we've got everything

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.180 
healing the gut so we've got everything
we<00:03:34.090> need<00:03:34.300> all<00:03:34.630> at<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> same<00:03:35.140> time<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:36.010> should

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
we need all at the same time you should

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.910 
we need all at the same time you should
see<00:03:36.370> some<00:03:36.550> progress<00:03:36.910> there<00:03:40.350> okay<00:03:41.370> okay<00:03:43.920> so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
see some progress there okay okay so

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.220 
see some progress there okay okay so
that's<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.750> if<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.900> don't<00:03:47.020> have<00:03:47.110> any

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.290 
that's that if you don't have any
questions<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.430> kind<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.090> wanted

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
questions on that I just kind of wanted

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.180 
questions on that I just kind of wanted
to<00:03:49.360> review<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:51.180> was<00:03:52.180> actually<00:03:52.890> did<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> webinar
