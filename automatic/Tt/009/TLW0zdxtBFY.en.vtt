00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello world scene on the agenda 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.320
 tests 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:22.160
 scleral skis today we have a big phisher 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.660
 step store like 110 some 186 long 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.240
 I don't even know where to start 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.030
 because honestly the next is good 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.780
 asked to say can not ambiguous to 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 one relationship is one 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.840
 nothing in any frame 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.089
 ski 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.210
 this is not a free ride on skis I can immediately 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.539
 say because riding in virgin soil 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 they are impossible just well maybe 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.469
 Of course it is real but for this virgin land 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.559
 It must be some approach to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 the ideal should be some kind of soft 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.809
 fresh snow there they certainly work 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.829
 good but is there any one ski on the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.190
 works well 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.589
 on the principle of everyday life freerider Skog 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.070
 skating and considered the following is us 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.140
 I can say this is a nightmare 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 just your nightmare I don't understand how it is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.340
 so because on the one hand you do 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.820
 no way she punches softly at all 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 what 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.219
 but at the same time it does not fulfill these 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.100
 detonation which is this curve us 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.110
 gives out sausage scary so but to me 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.439
 there so well it was not bad I honestly say 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 to where 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.350
 whether I like 110 this piece yes and you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.899
 should feel good and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 torsions hard I already fall your 110 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.149
 for me in my understanding for good 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.070
 watering this this is very little but when 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.159
 it is not there, as it were, does not give it is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.899
 not universal ski on the slope it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.860
 very soft you are no longer holding 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.530
 trajectory that does not work 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.900
 bumps that while 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.130
 slippage actually manages 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.020
 pull even in the soft slope broken in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.790
 In general, I did not understand where on these 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.430
 skiing and in general it is possible and on them 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.410
 ride me the feeling that the firm 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.230
 phisher and how jammed in some one 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.880
 tragedy called version 4 here they 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.890
 good at everything else not 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.250
 trying to do something like here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.780
 of these successful carving models 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.060
 it is necessary to understand already that freeride is a little bit 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 another story because there are some 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.140
 others are already a little game rules 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.640
 well and how it is to produce others 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.459
 somehow already learned how to do it 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.380
 that you can go to the same places 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.800
 skiing calm that is for me now 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.630
 it is generally a complete outsider though 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.370
 saying can't even say read side 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.010
 of riding only squeeze understanding it is not 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.590
 freeride skier buyer 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 consider absolutely no less than anyone 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.609
 sense and, moreover, 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.989
 if you recall past goths 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.090
 I came across on the tests a little bit 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.849
 others lyakh but i can say that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.819
 better then any more than this as Talysh 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.750
 for skiing the slope on the slope she too 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.459
 no way rolls 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.989
 well that's all pliz tell me more they 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.180
 you don't want anything because 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.760
 the next one is better if we 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.709
 caught by the distribution were essentially 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 interesting about this is another series to 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.329
 do not miss the channel is signed everything to everyone 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.409
 until we meet somewhere I donâ€™t know where 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.409
 on the tests all bye
