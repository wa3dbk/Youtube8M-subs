00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
the that was really difficult for me at

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.800 
the that was really difficult for me at
the<00:03:33.519> beginning<00:03:33.640> because<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.450> said<00:03:34.510> we

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the beginning because like I said we

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.710 
the beginning because like I said we
didn't<00:03:35.019> do<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.170> in<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:36.220> Mexico<00:03:36.820> but<00:03:37.360> here<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
didn't do that in in Mexico but here I

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.900 
didn't do that in in Mexico but here I
had<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.260> opportunity<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.980> work<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:39.250> Dusty

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
had the opportunity to work with Dusty

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.180 
had the opportunity to work with Dusty
Rhodes<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.450> he<00:03:40.900> helped<00:03:41.230> me<00:03:41.290> all<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.709> way<00:03:41.890> when

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
Rhodes and he helped me all the way when

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.430

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
I was there in FCW and I think that's

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.949 
I was there in FCW and I think that's
the<00:03:44.560> reason<00:03:44.890> I'm<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.160> good<00:03:45.370> at<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.640> right<00:03:46.360> and

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
the reason I'm so good at it right and
