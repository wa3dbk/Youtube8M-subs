current<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.080> bend<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.800> some<00:02:12.100> trees<00:02:12.370> that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
current with a bend and some trees that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.790 
current with a bend and some trees that
hang<00:02:12.820> over<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.480> water<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.959> supposedly<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
hang over the water and supposedly that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220 
hang over the water and supposedly that
will<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.130> recipe<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:15.640> disaster<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.990> just

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
will be a recipe for disaster you just

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.440 
will be a recipe for disaster you just
navigate<00:02:17.410> through<00:02:17.890> here<00:02:18.070> yes<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:18.880> did<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.420> is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
navigate through here yes we did now is

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
navigate through here yes we did now is
a<00:02:19.660> little<00:02:19.959> tricky<00:02:20.230> going<00:02:20.440> by<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.620> curve

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
a little tricky going by this curve

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.380 
a little tricky going by this curve
because<00:02:21.400> no<00:02:21.520> we<00:02:21.730> haven't<00:02:21.910> went<00:02:22.120> through<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
because no we haven't went through the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.220 
because no we haven't went through the
curve<00:02:22.570> yet<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.020> just<00:02:23.230> saw<00:02:23.410> oh<00:02:24.930> yeah<00:02:25.959> it's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
curve yet we just saw oh yeah it's

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.420 
curve yet we just saw oh yeah it's
inevitable<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.010> what's<00:02:27.280> your

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
inevitable you think you what's your

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.800 
inevitable you think you what's your
strategy<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.300> through<00:02:28.480> there<00:02:28.630> just

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
strategy to get through there just

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.510 
strategy to get through there just
navigate<00:02:29.560> around<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.130> think<00:02:30.310> we'll<00:02:30.430> be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
navigate around it I think we'll be

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.479 
navigate around it I think we'll be
alright<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:31.330> got<00:02:31.450> shots<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.930> lot<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.170> people

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
alright we got shots of a lot of people

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.820 
alright we got shots of a lot of people
not<00:02:33.489> making<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.300> alrighty<00:02:34.660> well<00:02:35.530> from<00:02:35.680> what

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
not making it alrighty well from what

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.470 
not making it alrighty well from what
I've<00:02:35.980> seen<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.459> always<00:02:36.820> just<00:02:37.209> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
I've seen it's not always just you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.760 
I've seen it's not always just you
though<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:37.900> sometimes<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.500> looks<00:02:38.590> like

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
though because sometimes it looks like

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.949 
though because sometimes it looks like
