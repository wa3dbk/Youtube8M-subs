slack line even after it's on the bottom

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.500

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
so I can watch the line and if a fish

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.120 
so I can watch the line and if a fish
bites<00:06:50.840> I<00:06:51.020> can<00:06:51.170> see<00:06:51.350> the<00:06:51.470> line<00:06:51.650> move<00:06:51.890> and<00:06:52.070> the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
bites I can see the line move and the

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.670 
bites I can see the line move and the
fish<00:06:52.280> doesn't<00:06:52.520> feel<00:06:52.790> me<00:06:53.150> and<00:06:53.530> really<00:06:54.530> that's
