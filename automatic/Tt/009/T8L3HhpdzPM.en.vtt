if one wheel does lift up if you still

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
if one wheel does lift up if you still
got<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:48.120> control<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> traction<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.260> other

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
got good control of traction for other

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.810 
got good control of traction for other
the<00:00:50.399> traction<00:00:50.730> control<00:00:51.230> differential<00:00:52.230> locks

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.800

vote<00:01:01.290> although<00:01:02.160> gives<00:01:02.400> us<00:01:03.140> more<00:01:04.140> control<00:01:04.320> over

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
vote although gives us more control over

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.300 
vote although gives us more control over
the<00:01:05.940> engine<00:01:06.540> speed<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> there's<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.010> talk

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the engine speed and there's more talk

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.940 
the engine speed and there's more talk
as<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:08.670> let<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.240> go

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760 

we've<00:01:12.670> got<00:01:12.759> another<00:01:12.939> bit<00:01:13.119> of<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.770> water

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
we've got another bit of a water

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.570 
we've got another bit of a water
crossing

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.550 

and<00:01:21.580> again<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.900> going<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.260> a<00:01:23.290> stick

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
and again it's going to be a stick

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.080 
and again it's going to be a stick
descent<00:01:23.950> I'm<00:01:24.190> just<00:01:24.280> going<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.520> shift<00:01:24.790> into<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
descent I'm just going to shift into a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
descent I'm just going to shift into a
lower<00:01:25.270> gear<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.370> vehicle<00:01:27.550> down<00:01:27.910> into<00:01:28.240> this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
lower gear is the vehicle down into this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.680 
lower gear is the vehicle down into this
trough<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:31.030> we've<00:01:31.150> got<00:01:31.270> some<00:01:31.420> more<00:01:31.510> deep

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
trough and we've got some more deep

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.910 
trough and we've got some more deep
water<00:01:31.900> view<00:01:32.110> it's<00:01:32.260> important<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.650> keep<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
water view it's important to keep the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.580 
water view it's important to keep the
throttle<00:01:33.070> goings<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.730> cars<00:01:34.590> maintaining

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
throttle goings of the cars maintaining

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.680 
throttle goings of the cars maintaining
good<00:01:35.710> progress<00:01:36.040> through<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.460> water<00:01:36.690> you've

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
good progress through the water you've

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.760 
good progress through the water you've
got<00:01:37.810> some<00:01:37.990> pressure<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.470> transmission

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
got some pressure in the transmission

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.200 
got some pressure in the transmission
and<00:01:39.100> differentials<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.760> stop<00:01:39.940> water<00:01:40.120> getting

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
and differentials to stop water getting

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.590 
and differentials to stop water getting
into<00:01:40.510> them<00:01:41.250> yeah

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
into them yeah

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.289 
into them yeah
stick<00:01:44.320> climb<00:01:44.560> up<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> other<00:01:44.890> side<00:01:45.299> not

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
stick climb up the other side not

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.910 
stick climb up the other side not
spinning<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.750> wheels<00:01:46.930> too<00:01:47.170> much<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.680> enough

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
spinning the wheels too much just enough

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.320 
spinning the wheels too much just enough
to<00:01:48.159> maintain<00:01:48.479> momentum<00:01:49.479> in<00:01:49.930> traction<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:55.210> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
to maintain momentum in traction it's a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:03.520 
to maintain momentum in traction it's a
more<00:01:55.479> deporting<00:01:55.900> here

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.410 

again<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.340> 800<00:02:04.760> millimeter<00:02:04.970> waiting

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
again the 800 millimeter waiting

capability of this car I measure to
tackle<00:02:07.940> these<00:02:08.060> deep<00:02:08.979> water<00:02:09.979> puddles<00:02:10.480> with

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
tackle these deep water puddles with

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.559 
tackle these deep water puddles with
confidence<00:02:12.880> okay<00:02:13.880> we've<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.120> got<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> bit<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.510> a

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
confidence okay we've now got a bit of a

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.080 
confidence okay we've now got a bit of a
steep<00:02:14.780> grade<00:02:15.020> here<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.850> going<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
steep grade here so I'm just going to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.140 
steep grade here so I'm just going to
pick<00:02:17.569> my<00:02:17.750> line<00:02:18.730> squeeze<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.940> spot<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.300> we<00:02:20.959> go

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.420 

go<00:02:27.150> not<00:02:27.720> too<00:02:27.989> much<00:02:28.200> enthusiasm<00:02:28.440> over<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.250> top

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
go not too much enthusiasm over the top
