00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
should be like further back in the shot

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.299 
should be like further back in the shot
even<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.660> like<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> lot<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.200> keep<00:00:49.950> moving

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
even more like a lot more keep moving

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
even more like a lot more keep moving
perfect<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.090> bet<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> shot<00:00:51.780> looks<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.079> lot

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
perfect I bet that shot looks a lot

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
perfect I bet that shot looks a lot
better<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.120> featured<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.329> mean

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
better because now I'm featured I mean

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.540 
better because now I'm featured I mean
that's<00:00:54.660> sort<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.680> prone<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.340> right

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's sort of that's prone it up right

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.770 
that's sort of that's prone it up right
there<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.260> thing<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.219> could<00:00:59.399> get

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
there the other thing if we could get

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.209 
there the other thing if we could get
you're<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
you're going to want like that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.340 
you're going to want like that
so<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.760> maybe<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> sponsorship<00:01:03.719> deal<00:01:03.899> out

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so we maybe get a sponsorship deal out

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
so we maybe get a sponsorship deal out
of<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
of it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
of it
so<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.830> sort<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
so if we could if I can just sort of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
so if we could if I can just sort of
naturally<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> shot<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
naturally have that in the shot you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.399 
naturally have that in the shot you
don't<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> try<00:01:11.479> hopper<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> hopper

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
don't got to try hopper like a hopper

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.999 
don't got to try hopper like a hopper
dropper<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.000> that's<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> hopper<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> then

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
dropper so that's like a hopper and then

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
dropper so that's like a hopper and then
you've<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> hopper<00:01:17.880> dropper<00:01:18.450> that's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you've got like a hopper dropper that's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
you've got like a hopper dropper that's
to<00:01:19.650> hoppers<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.840> lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> times<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> freestone

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to hoppers a lot of times on a freestone

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.580 
to hoppers a lot of times on a freestone
like<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.479> I'll<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> hopper<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> hopper

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
like this I'll do a hopper with a hopper

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
like this I'll do a hopper with a hopper
dropper<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> dropper<00:01:26.670> hopper<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> that's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
dropper with a dropper hopper so that's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.219 
dropper with a dropper hopper so that's
a<00:01:28.290> hopper<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> got<00:01:29.880> another<00:01:29.970> hopper<00:01:30.600> you
