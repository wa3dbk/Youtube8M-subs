00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.420
 what a fresh busy schedule will refresh the rest of europe was the sun 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.249
 fantastic anp 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.409
 when the weather does not exist of course but music as the one does 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.859
 for me because the city busier for all what the new album smelled came from this one 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:18.640
 summer 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.680
 a number of sick people can protest 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.469
 the album to is for the first time always very much according to glittered to 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.280
 the concert yes it was fantastic 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.780
 that's what you all have to do that has happened very briefly 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.200
 but by despite everything it was completely sold out that afterwards do uhm 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.240
 it was a wonderful atmosphere the nice and warm on poles they want nice 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.280
 tool where aegon swedish many artists and on stage 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.159
 that always looks an impression 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.010
 are country rich and it is a chip fund by the extra bandung aln 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.550
 but then the brand can start winning if you can do it anyway 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.510
 more sweating the people were super good though more like the yes the band was good 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 was good will be a very good response to the atmosphere was also suggested 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.750
 evening then 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.300
 and it was fantastic yet another product to the man the man in black 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.720
 and red existed 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.580
 yes and we are now presenting a biography or a voice that where i have one 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.940
 sad story that the voice that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.070
 year with a profound yet not only a good singer but also a the man who 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.990
 if you like the animal then they should hear very nice place could also be 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.320
 the point a big role what a son 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 I don't have the composition issues that honor the mood of the project 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 puppet theater plays the guy to bring whatever i like 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.290
 we sing with that is more only than sing with the snow on 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.060
 to taste 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.090
 with a draft I did not inform the hand then 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.090
 yet 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.050
 this total of fourteen numbers are that she is right now the numbers for a few weeks 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.340
 also from the concerts of the people 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 whatever a lot the polymer turn live the care top request i was one 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.439
 other they that disturb someone's couple who are again high up in the tower sales 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.840
 and yes also a few the unknown or for most people nevertheless in Europe 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.869
 unfamiliar numbers where I put up a package deal 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.930
 claim from bales kratos england those those numbers that are less known 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.389
 church typical tilt west shots of a movie roj once made 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.050
 in which the knmi plays the shoots afterwards has criticism 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.459
 but that was a blunder 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.730
 the euro was not an actor 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.159
 the school a fantastic south but those numbers in the film are fantastic 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.409
 are less known and have them then 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.599
 given a new arrangement and that is also on the album I have it 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.239
 all done yourself from a to z yes behind it was a diamond island expensive 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.589
 creams and a little forgotten in the studio by meters too and 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:58.099
 even at a certain moment because about those who have the microbe and then 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.019
 then then think of i just had to do all the artist myself 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.650
 no one was wrong with the mood is good or something 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.610
 but i am content and the people are missing tiger woods has itself 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.540
 played in the cost of the plastic of the jug through the system works yes 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.589
 it all played 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.229
 has been a long time since it is my job, after all, I have nobody 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.539
 really week I have no appointment another study so tipping time and 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:22.369
 same 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.529
 And that's okay so months is going to be a marketing lover period of that 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.349
 sounds good that's other nation you listen to the song one time not good 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.049
 is to leave behind 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.069
 the museum is acclimatizing you and then seeing you as the final because this is 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.819
 it what i want on sunday and then it was the turn and but it was busy from one 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.379
 Header vibration standards don't really come and all because 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.980
 I have you all those numbers will fall the unemployed month how I prefer 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.549
 would hear these numbers 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.459
 sprinkle it before have done otherwise so there will be more I will 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.209
 Skills are done but the point is the data center that it is not that much 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.029
 more attractive to throw delayed this is a numbers 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:04.469
 and that that stands as a confrontation of the cat's meter sometimes toulon or 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.489
 ours was busy with nothing more then sprinkle that beside 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.349
 sit along 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.889
 was to say there find persons 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.339
 sony that costs almelo plays and that probably has a bit 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.359
 lots of nuts and we want to support vanhecke if not missing 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.610
 she is not 100 but 200 percent in a row became stadeus by his like 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.050
 My career 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.809
 I always say look sixth 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:32.169
 you get a bit behind so all of the papers are concerned because most would 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.210
 his is sons enschede although I must say that they do not say books like castro 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.530
 measles that fantastic and that makes a lot of what we do it is however 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.890
 necessary because there is a lot involved in music even though people think so 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.620
 music is just a hobby and and carnival there is a lot involved 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.819
 or the contour 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.639
 and he is for me the perfect thing about smoking it's still time for it 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.210
 relaxation yes acknowledges music is my relaxation and I have a swimming pool 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.749
 installed 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.999
 each can swim twice this year said something o 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.050
 was 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.360
 Yes 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
