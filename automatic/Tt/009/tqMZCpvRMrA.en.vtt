going over how to create a slider bar

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.619 
going over how to create a slider bar
for<00:00:04.290> your<00:00:04.529> menu<00:00:05.040> now<00:00:05.940> we're<00:00:06.150> not<00:00:06.270> going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> be

for your menu now we're not going to be

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.350 
for your menu now we're not going to be
putting<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.290> into<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.890> options<00:00:08.400> menu<00:00:08.910> but

putting this into the options menu but
it's<00:00:09.540> just<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.080> part<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.380> our<00:00:10.500> menu

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it's just going to be a part of our menu

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.310 
it's just going to be a part of our menu
for<00:00:11.010> right<00:00:11.160> now<00:00:11.780> we'd<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.080> create

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
for right now we'd have to create

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.210 
for right now we'd have to create
another<00:00:13.769> probably<00:00:15.170> layer<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> GUI<00:00:16.890> or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
another probably layer for the GUI or

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
another probably layer for the GUI or
enable<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.240> disable<00:00:18.359> different<00:00:19.080> buttons

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
enable and disable different buttons

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.130 
enable and disable different buttons
which<00:00:19.859> might<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.270> bit<00:00:21.390> longer<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
which might take a little bit longer to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.259 
which might take a little bit longer to
do<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.760> might<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.939> little<00:00:24.090> more

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
do and might be a little more

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810 
do and might be a little more
complicated<00:00:25.070> but<00:00:26.070> right<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.789> just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
complicated but right now we're just

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
complicated but right now we're just
going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.449> messing<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> slider<00:00:28.710> for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
going to be messing with a slider for

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.420 
going to be messing with a slider for
adjusting<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> games<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.949> options

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
adjusting so a lot of games with options

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.930 
adjusting so a lot of games with options
you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> adjust<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.239> slider<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.940> adjust

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you can adjust the slider to adjust

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.110 
you can adjust the slider to adjust
volume<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:37.140> whatever<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.090> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
volume or whatever and this one we are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
volume or whatever and this one we are
going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.570> adjusting<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.290> camera

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
going to be adjusting our camera

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to be adjusting our camera
sensitivity<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:42.660> RTS<00:00:43.260> camera<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.920> we're

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
sensitivity for our RTS camera so we're

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
sensitivity for our RTS camera so we're
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> able<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.629> slow<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.170> or

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
going to be able to slow it down or

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
going to be able to slow it down or
speed<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.950> depending<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
speed it up depending on what the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
speed it up depending on what the
players<00:00:48.360> preferences<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:50.129> players<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
players preferences some players like a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.619 
players preferences some players like a
really<00:00:51.449> fast<00:00:51.690> moving<00:00:52.079> camera<00:00:52.530> others<00:00:52.890> might

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
really fast moving camera others might

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.910 
really fast moving camera others might
want<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> slower<00:00:55.050> moving<00:00:55.440> camera<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:57.920> we're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
want a slower moving camera so we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.170 
want a slower moving camera so we're
going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.219> check<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.520> our<00:00:59.579> code<00:00:59.910> real

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
going to go check out our code real

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.670 
going to go check out our code real
quick<00:01:00.390> um<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> slider<00:01:02.520> value<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
quick um the slider value so this is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.730 
quick um the slider value so this is
going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.250> um<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.290> slider<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
going to be um what our slider is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to be um what our slider is
default<00:01:08.580> set<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.180> currently<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> set<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
default set at currently which I set it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.960 
default set at currently which I set it
to<00:01:11.340> 10<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
to 10 and we're going to go in here the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.230 
to 10 and we're going to go in here the
slider<00:01:15.330> value<00:01:15.840> equals<00:01:16.590> GUI<00:01:17.240> horizontal

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
slider value equals GUI horizontal

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.929 
slider value equals GUI horizontal
slider<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.520> creating<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
slider and we're going to be creating a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.690 
slider and we're going to be creating a
new<00:01:21.090> rectangle<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> where<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
new rectangle for it and this is where I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.149 
new rectangle for it and this is where I
place<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.360> screen<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.229> place<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
place it on the screen you can place it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.240 
place it on the screen you can place it
wherever<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:28.040> length

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
wherever you want and then length

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.380 
wherever you want and then length
I<00:01:30.310> are<00:01:31.260> with<00:01:32.260> them<00:01:32.470> height<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.160> then<00:01:33.910> we<00:01:34.120> plug

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
I are with them height and then we plug

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.969 
I are with them height and then we plug
in<00:01:34.450> our<00:01:34.630> V<00:01:35.500> slider<00:01:35.860> value<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:38.530> can<00:01:38.800> be

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
in our V slider value which can be

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.760 
in our V slider value which can be
adjusted<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.630> will<00:01:40.780> be<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.290> believe<00:01:41.740> our

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
adjusted and this will be I believe our

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.910 
adjusted and this will be I believe our
max<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.550> minimum<00:01:43.240> values<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.560> for

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
max and minimum values we can have for

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.710 
max and minimum values we can have for
our<00:01:45.000> V<00:01:46.000> slider<00:01:46.810> value<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.790> that's<00:01:49.330> pretty<00:01:49.630> much

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
our V slider value so that's pretty much

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.620 
our V slider value so that's pretty much
the<00:01:49.900> basic<00:01:50.650> code<00:01:51.010> for<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:52.000> threw<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.540> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the basic code for that so I threw it in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.290 
the basic code for that so I threw it in
here<00:01:52.960> where<00:01:53.229> we<00:01:54.100> have<00:01:54.130> our<00:01:54.310> option<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.090> it'll

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
here where we have our option so it'll

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.040 
here where we have our option so it'll
just<00:01:55.330> show<00:01:55.570> up<00:01:55.780> blower<00:01:56.110> options<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.600> yeah<00:01:58.780> and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
just show up blower options but yeah and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.130 
just show up blower options but yeah and
so<00:01:59.979> for<00:02:00.340> our<00:02:00.369> V<00:02:00.729> slider<00:02:01.060> value<00:02:01.479> if<00:02:01.660> we<00:02:01.810> want<00:02:02.050> to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
so for our V slider value if we want to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.290 
so for our V slider value if we want to
apply<00:02:02.619> this<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.729> have<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.000> set<00:02:04.149> as<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
apply this so we have it set as the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.430 
apply this so we have it set as the
float<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.619> go<00:02:05.740> back<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.100> player<00:02:06.280> stats

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
float and go back in the player stats

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.949 
float and go back in the player stats
and<00:02:10.920> let<00:02:11.920> me<00:02:12.040> think<00:02:12.250> real<00:02:12.550> quick<00:02:12.790> oh<00:02:12.940> no<00:02:13.420> not<00:02:13.780> in

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
and let me think real quick oh no not in

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.650 
and let me think real quick oh no not in
player<00:02:14.140> stats<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.739> got<00:02:14.950> mixed<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.360> okay<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.420> we

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
player stats I got mixed up okay so we

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.740 
player stats I got mixed up okay so we
went<00:02:16.959> into<00:02:17.140> our<00:02:17.320> RTS<00:02:17.739> camera<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.250> said<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.360> um

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
went into our RTS camera and said so um

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.280 
went into our RTS camera and said so um
we<00:02:20.590> took<00:02:20.739> cam<00:02:20.980> speed<00:02:21.340> which<00:02:21.970> Kim's<00:02:22.330> speed<00:02:22.989> was

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
we took cam speed which Kim's speed was

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.430 
we took cam speed which Kim's speed was
our<00:02:23.530> initial<00:02:24.340> speed<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.060> which<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:26.080> camera

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
our initial speed of which our camera

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.290 
our initial speed of which our camera
moves<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.910> equaled<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.220> menu<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:31.000> slider

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
moves and I equaled it to menu be slider

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.360 
moves and I equaled it to menu be slider
value<00:02:31.690> through<00:02:32.500> Dan<00:02:32.680> update<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.280> will

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
value through Dan update so it will

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.900 
value through Dan update so it will
constantly<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.880> updating<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.140> change

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
constantly be updating so it can change

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.259 
constantly be updating so it can change
so<00:02:36.910> yeah<00:02:37.840> that's<00:02:38.350> that'll<00:02:39.040> change<00:02:39.340> value<00:02:40.000> as

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
so yeah that's that'll change value as

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.350 
so yeah that's that'll change value as
we<00:02:40.570> adjust<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.989> slider<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> that's<00:02:43.090> pretty

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
we adjust the slider so that's pretty

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.770 
we adjust the slider so that's pretty
much<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.380> code<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.860> need<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.780> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
much all the code you need for that it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.460 
much all the code you need for that it's
pretty<00:02:46.959> basic<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:50.760> yeah<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> made<00:02:52.290> let's<00:02:53.290> go

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
pretty basic also yeah I made let's go

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.550 
pretty basic also yeah I made let's go
back<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
back to

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.710 
back to
menu<00:02:56.250> real<00:02:56.400> quick<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.790> made<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.360> static

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
menu real quick I made it a static

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.860 
menu real quick I made it a static
variable<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.349> we<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.560> transfer<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.870> went

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
variable so we can transfer it so I went

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.220 
variable so we can transfer it so I went
in<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.200> did<00:03:01.410> menu<00:03:01.830> dot<00:03:02.040> V<00:03:02.610> slider<00:03:02.940> value<00:03:03.300> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
in here did menu dot V slider value so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.589 
in here did menu dot V slider value so
it'll<00:03:04.530> pretty<00:03:04.650> much<00:03:04.800> yeah<00:03:05.099> apply<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:05.910> value

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
it'll pretty much yeah apply this value

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.940 
it'll pretty much yeah apply this value
to<00:03:06.870> our<00:03:06.900> camp<00:03:07.380> speed<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.950> adjust<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.950> once

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
to our camp speed to adjust it and once

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.910 
to our camp speed to adjust it and once
you<00:03:11.069> have<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.190> all<00:03:11.640> set<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.440> there<00:03:13.440> should<00:03:13.739> be

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you have that all set up there should be

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.620 
you have that all set up there should be
anything<00:03:14.459> else<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.849> don't<00:03:14.910> believe<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.300> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
anything else I don't believe that you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.860 
anything else I don't believe that you
need<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.959> adjust<00:03:16.580> we<00:03:17.580> go<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.750> can

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
need to adjust we go in here and you can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.850 
need to adjust we go in here and you can
see<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.140> our<00:03:19.500> camera<00:03:19.920> moves<00:03:20.480> relatively

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
see that our camera moves relatively

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.590 
see that our camera moves relatively
fast<00:03:23.450> now<00:03:24.450> n<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.200> my<00:03:25.440> key<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.849> I<00:03:26.880> can<00:03:26.970> go<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.300> here

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
fast now n is my key so I can go in here

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.330 
fast now n is my key so I can go in here
and<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.140> click<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.590> adjust<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.980> slider

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
and I can click and adjust the slider

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.820 
and I can click and adjust the slider
and<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.060> see<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.540> changing<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.590> little<00:03:31.709> bit

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
and we can see it changing a little bit

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.090 
and we can see it changing a little bit
I<00:03:32.100> can<00:03:32.940> adjust<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.600> now<00:03:34.560> it'll<00:03:34.830> move

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
I can adjust it and now it'll move

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.229 
I can adjust it and now it'll move
really<00:03:35.970> really<00:03:36.239> slowly<00:03:37.130> depending<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.239> what

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
really really slowly depending on what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.470 
really really slowly depending on what
the<00:03:39.299> value<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.810> set<00:03:40.110> up<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:42.030> adjust<00:03:42.120> it

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
the value is set up so you can adjust it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.570 
the value is set up so you can adjust it
to<00:03:42.510> your<00:03:42.660> liking<00:03:42.900> however<00:03:43.799> fast<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.250> wanted

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
to to move and it'll stay saved so if

to to move and it'll stay saved so if
you<00:03:49.680> wanted<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.959> add<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.890> into<00:03:53.040> what<00:03:53.819> we

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
you wanted to like add that into what we

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.330 
you wanted to like add that into what we
did<00:03:54.060> before<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:54.680> when<00:03:55.680> we<00:03:55.799> were<00:03:55.860> making<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
did before for when we were making the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.810 
did before for when we were making the
saving<00:03:56.849> loading<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.420> could<00:03:57.660> save<00:03:58.230> that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
saving loading you could save that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.160 
saving loading you could save that
variable<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.930> um<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:03.690> yeah<00:04:03.840> when<00:04:04.049> you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
variable so that um so yeah when you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.960 
variable so that um so yeah when you
load<00:04:04.320> up<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> game<00:04:04.769> all<00:04:05.100> your<00:04:05.340> options<00:04:05.489> would

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
load up the game all your options would

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.979 
load up the game all your options would
be<00:04:06.030> saved<00:04:06.390> through<00:04:06.660> there<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> yeah<00:04:08.989> that's

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
be saved through there so yeah that's

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.550 
be saved through there so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:10.230> much<00:04:10.680> all<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.280> need<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.970> know<00:04:12.120> for

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
pretty much all you need to know for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.810 
pretty much all you need to know for
this<00:04:13.560> tutorial<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.730> yeah<00:04:16.190> we<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.340> probably<00:04:17.430> go

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this tutorial so yeah we can probably go

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.320 
this tutorial so yeah we can probably go
over<00:04:18.000> more<00:04:18.359> advanced<00:04:18.750> options<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.979> future

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
over more advanced options in the future

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.260 
over more advanced options in the future
so<00:04:22.780> yeah<00:04:23.470> if<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.830> guys<00:04:23.979> having<00:04:24.400> our<00:04:24.520> ideas<00:04:24.879> for

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
so yeah if you guys having our ideas for

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.600 
so yeah if you guys having our ideas for
other<00:04:25.300> maybe<00:04:26.169> GUI<00:04:26.500> options<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> cover

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
other maybe GUI options I like a cover

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.999 
other maybe GUI options I like a cover
please<00:04:30.610> leave<00:04:30.789> them<00:04:30.939> in<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.449> comments<00:04:31.810> below

I'm<00:04:33.009> probably<00:04:33.460> also<00:04:33.819> going<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.419> make<00:04:35.319> another

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
I'm probably also going to make another
