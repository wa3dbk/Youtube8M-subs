00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.740
 Another year and a half ago at a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.480
 and bought on friese over in our safe 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.039
 has no complaints at home 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.350
 those fish and they were very healthy and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.980
 thick and everything very ok but the thing is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.050
 now 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.039
 now i recently wash my terrace 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.890
 dog pull 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 I mean lace candles and with mega sheet 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 and now there is a python 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.950
 both fell into your pond and I have me 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.200
 had already seen in itself tactics of white 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.570
 no problem pulling it at its worst 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 fish were pale or so standards 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.489
 so here on death already and yes I have 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.579
 thought initially we 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.860
 all apparently there is now and then 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 the problem is those fish that were from 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.350

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 beaten and it was really total 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.489
 had him upstairs and the good was that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.280
