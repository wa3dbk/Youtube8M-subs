00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 now 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.139
 hi girls and guys how are you this time 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.809
 I bring you a makeup tutorial that 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.200
 they have asked me a lot especially in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.970
 a little younger girls 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.910
 because they are always asking me 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.250
 a kind of gentle makeup that is 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.099
 they can use let's say in day to day or 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.740
 for the cole for the university and for 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.509
 go out with friends to my notice of things for 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 the style that are super sexy super 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.560
 quick they think they prepare us this 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.740
 look that in very few steps can be 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.960
 very nice and very radiant depending 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.480
 how they combine it, I leave them with the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.840
 tutorial of this look so that they can 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 perform 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.020
 we will start this look by applying our 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.630
 cream base of our makeup 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 usual is we will put it in points 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.430
 specific and we will begin to spread by 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.160
 all our face until we have say 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.729
 a fairly homogeneous color in everything 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.860
 that is our face and neck after 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.590
 this will apply our corrector 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.500
 eye bags 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 remembering that we can always melt it 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.630
 in our faces of both little ones 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.039
 touches with our ring finger one 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 once applied to our concealer 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.289
 dark circles we go to our northern paul 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.179
 face with a big brush and taking 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.649
 a little loose powder to seal what 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.240
 which is our foundation and 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.670
 our proofreaders later 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.459
 we will take a shadow in a brown tone 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.719
 Of course this is my preference if 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.250
 you prefer, you can take a 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:51.890
 skin tone or tone let's say a little more 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.920
 bone color this will apply in all my 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.230
 mobile eyelid reaching the part 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.140
 of the eyebrow bone 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.580
 then I will take a dark brown shadow 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.850
 to give to give it a touch of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.610
 depth to my eye we will apply this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.040
 in what is the eye arch without getting 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.400
 much to the lacrimal we repeat this same 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 technique in both eyes and after that 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.710
 we will apply a black crayon can be 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.380
 black or brown this depending on the 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.260
 choice of each one in our line of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.140
 This water will be to give it one more touch 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.520
 intense to our look after it 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.170
 we will make a delineation is superior external 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 this line we must be very close to what 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.520
 will be our eyelashes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.810
 we take we started from the tear 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.450
 to the outside of our eye 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.870
 after that we will apply a bit of 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.489
 mascara 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.489
 or mascara 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.990
 and to complete this what we will apply 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.300
 a blush in this case I will apply a 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.060
 stealing grams which has to be 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.170
 applied with small taps since 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.870
 it's something that 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.640
 it melts easily with the face if 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.380
 prefer you can also apply it with 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.569
 a brush with its movements 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.299
 circular as usual 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.079
 to finish we will apply a pink tone 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.870
 on our lips it can be pink or a 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.390
 Skin tone if you prefer 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.180
 and then they can also apply 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.330
 If you want a touch of gloss of it 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.330
 tone 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 we will apply a bit of our 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.840
 illuminator in cream below the bone 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.330
 our eyebrows to apply tips of 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.670
 light to our look this same what 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.440
 we can apply on the bone of the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.690
 cheek 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.360
 and well and that is how we complete this 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.310
 look super easy and super simple in 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.290
 few steps 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.870
 and well girls is that way we can 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.489
 make this look I hope you have them 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.550
 liked it very much and put it in 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.970
 practice is extremely simple and let's say 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.440
 that gives it a more natural look and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.299
 colorful at once to our face without 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.940
 need to exaggerate those makeups 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.250
 that we often use for parties 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.350
 nightly occasions I hope you have 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.780
 very much liked if so
