00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
have a 12 ax7 you can see the two stages

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.830 
have a 12 ax7 you can see the two stages
here<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.289> their<00:02:09.000> perspective<00:02:10.000> coupling

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
here have their perspective coupling

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
230 volts that feeds the preamp if you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.619 
230 volts that feeds the preamp if you
can<00:02:23.739> read<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.040> 50<00:02:24.400> milliamps<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.390> five

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
can read this 50 milliamps the five

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.589 
can read this 50 milliamps the five
means<00:02:25.930> 50<00:02:26.319> milliamps<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:27.550> idle<00:02:28.030> current<00:02:28.390> for

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
means 50 milliamps of idle current for

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.570 
means 50 milliamps of idle current for
the<00:02:28.690> 606<00:02:29.260> because<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> single<00:02:30.280> under

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
the 606 because a single under

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.390 
the 606 because a single under
transformer<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.270> an<00:02:31.420> old<00:02:31.569> freed<00:02:31.989> which<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
transformer it's an old freed which is a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.290 
transformer it's an old freed which is a
company<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.790> never<00:02:33.940> heard<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.239> before

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.710 

you

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.050 

for<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.400> right<00:02:46.400> now<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.550> volume<00:02:46.880> was<00:02:46.970> all

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
for this right now the volume was all

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.850 
for this right now the volume was all
the<00:02:47.150> way<00:02:47.240> down<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.560> see<00:02:48.650> volume

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
the way down so here you can see volume

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.730 
the way down so here you can see volume
goes<00:02:49.160> less<00:02:49.490> or<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:50.990> not<00:02:51.080> confusing

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
goes less or more so it's not confusing

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.800 
goes less or more so it's not confusing
there's<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.550> input<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.360> goes<00:02:53.540> through<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
there's the input it goes through a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.410 
there's the input it goes through a
resistor<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.800> goes<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.310> 12ax7<00:02:55.670> there's

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
resistor it goes to the 12ax7 there's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.780 
resistor it goes to the 12ax7 there's
two<00:02:56.600> stages<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:57.050> amplification<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.860> here<00:02:58.100> so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
two stages of amplification in here so

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.880 
two stages of amplification in here so
each<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.030> these<00:02:59.180> caps<00:02:59.480> couples<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.530> each<00:03:00.680> one

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
each of these caps couples to each one

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.920 
each of these caps couples to each one
and<00:03:01.070> then<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.910> goes<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.270> 6:06

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
and then it goes to the 6:06

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.050 
and then it goes to the 6:06
and<00:03:03.430> over<00:03:04.430> here<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.730> power<00:03:04.880> supply

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
and over here is the power supply

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.590 
and over here is the power supply
transformer<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.200> main<00:03:06.350> transformer<00:03:06.710> it<00:03:07.640> says

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.590 

I<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.380> 500<00:03:12.530> volts<00:03:12.980> AC<00:03:13.240> at<00:03:14.240> seventy

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
I think it's 500 volts AC at seventy

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.660 
I think it's 500 volts AC at seventy
five<00:03:14.630> milliamps<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.500> that's<00:03:16.340> what<00:03:16.520> gets

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
five milliamps and that's what gets

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.330 
five milliamps and that's what gets
converted<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.090> 340<00:03:17.660> volts<00:03:17.930> DC<00:03:18.250> here's<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
converted to 340 volts DC here's the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.190 
converted to 340 volts DC here's the
mains<00:03:19.520> power<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.090> as<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.750> see<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.050> just

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
mains power and as you can see it's just

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.470 
mains power and as you can see it's just
on<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.320> board<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:22.310> purpose<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.910> box<00:03:23.210> under

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
on a board the purpose of the box under

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.330 
on a board the purpose of the box under
it<00:03:23.600> was<00:03:23.720> for<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.930> speaker<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:25.070> I'm<00:03:25.190> actually

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it was for a speaker but I'm actually

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.850 
it was for a speaker but I'm actually
using<00:03:25.610> a<00:03:25.820> speaker<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.390> put<00:03:26.960> in<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.140> car<00:03:27.380> to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
using a speaker that I put in the car to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.290 
using a speaker that I put in the car to
attenuate<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.490> because<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:28.940> was<00:03:29.030> too<00:03:29.180> loud

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
attenuate it because it was too loud

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.450 
attenuate it because it was too loud
with<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.630> poor<00:03:30.320> little<00:03:30.560> microphone<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.370> the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
with a poor little microphone in the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.380 
with a poor little microphone in the
camera<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:33.290> guitar<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> was<00:03:33.800> playing<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:35.030> this

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
camera the guitar I was playing is this

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.850 
camera the guitar I was playing is this
summer<00:03:36.170> time<00:03:37.390> my<00:03:38.390> buddy<00:03:38.600> Fred<00:03:39.320> lent<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.680> me

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
summer time my buddy Fred lent it to me

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.410 
summer time my buddy Fred lent it to me
for<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.190> experience<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.730> think<00:03:40.880> he<00:03:40.940> paid<00:03:41.060> 60

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
for this experience I think he paid 60

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.990 
for this experience I think he paid 60
bucks<00:03:41.570> for<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.840> online<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.470> then<00:03:43.370> he<00:03:43.610> spent

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
bucks for it online and then he spent

00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:25.110 
bucks for it online and then he spent
another<00:03:44.060> 30<00:03:44.420> bucks<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.810> pair<00:03:44.990> of<00:03:45.020> pickups<00:03:45.350> so

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.180
