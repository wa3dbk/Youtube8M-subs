okay<00:00:05.980> we<00:00:06.130> gave<00:00:06.370> our<00:00:06.640> glue<00:00:07.030> a<00:00:07.060> chance<00:00:07.450> to<00:00:07.720> to

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
okay we gave our glue a chance to to

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.920 
okay we gave our glue a chance to to
cure<00:00:08.500> here<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:09.040> couple<00:00:09.520> minutes<00:00:09.700> there<00:00:10.450> are<00:00:10.600> a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
cure here a couple minutes there are a

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.850 
cure here a couple minutes there are a
number<00:00:11.500> of<00:00:12.660> Turner's<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.690> very<00:00:14.110> well-known

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
number of Turner's a very well-known

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.420 
number of Turner's a very well-known
process<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:15.790> lot<00:00:16.270> of<00:00:16.390> people<00:00:16.660> use<00:00:16.960> is<00:00:17.200> that<00:00:17.830> they

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
process a lot of people use is that they

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.870 
process a lot of people use is that they
while<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.599> bowl<00:00:19.779> is<00:00:19.990> in<00:00:20.140> this<00:00:20.290> position<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
while the bowl is in this position we

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.230 
while the bowl is in this position we
could<00:00:22.030> do<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.510> push<00:00:22.810> cut<00:00:23.110> and<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:24.580> downhill<00:00:24.820> to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
could do a push cut and go downhill to

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.439 
could do a push cut and go downhill to
the<00:00:25.330> fibers<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> outside<00:00:28.029> of<00:00:28.390> the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
the fibers and do the outside of the

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
the fibers and do the outside of the
bowl<00:00:28.920> okay<00:00:30.000> finish<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.180> outside<00:00:31.510> of<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.689> bowl

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
bowl okay finish the outside of the bowl

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530 
bowl okay finish the outside of the bowl
then<00:00:32.920> we'd<00:00:33.160> reverse<00:00:33.520> it<00:00:33.760> after<00:00:34.030> we<00:00:34.150> put<00:00:34.330> it<00:00:34.449> on

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
then we'd reverse it after we put it on

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.200 
then we'd reverse it after we put it on
the<00:00:34.660> glue<00:00:34.809> block<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:36.220> put<00:00:36.550> it<00:00:36.670> on<00:00:36.790> here<00:00:37.090> and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the glue block and put it on here and

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
the glue block and put it on here and
it's<00:00:37.809> not<00:00:38.140> going<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.559> run<00:00:38.800> perfectly<00:00:39.340> true

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it's not going to run perfectly true

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's not going to run perfectly true
that's<00:00:41.770> my<00:00:42.100> problem<00:00:42.370> with<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:42.790> process<00:00:43.210> it's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
that's my problem with that process it's

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.440 
that's my problem with that process it's
not<00:00:43.930> going<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.260> run<00:00:44.469> perfectly<00:00:44.920> true<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:46.059> I

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
not going to run perfectly true so I

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.690 
not going to run perfectly true so I
prefer<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.620> do<00:00:47.770> both<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.190> inside<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.579> the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
prefer to do both the inside and the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.270 
prefer to do both the inside and the
outside<00:00:48.880> after<00:00:49.660> it's<00:00:49.780> been<00:00:50.230> reversed<00:00:50.649> on<00:00:50.950> on

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
outside after it's been reversed on on

glue<00:00:53.200> block<00:00:53.410> we're<00:00:54.399> going<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.610> finish<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
glue block we're going to finish the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.750 
glue block we're going to finish the
outside<00:00:55.300> completely<00:00:56.140> make<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:57.039> really<00:00:57.579> nice

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
outside completely make it really nice

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.260 
outside completely make it really nice
and<00:00:58.030> smooth<00:00:58.270> get<00:00:58.600> it<00:00:58.719> all<00:00:58.870> ready<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.559> sand<00:00:59.860> if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and smooth get it all ready to sand if

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.939 
and smooth get it all ready to sand if
my<00:01:01.270> goal<00:01:01.510> on<00:01:01.539> what<00:01:01.930> I'm<00:01:02.050> doing<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.379> outside<00:01:02.739> is

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
my goal on what I'm doing the outside is

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.100 
my goal on what I'm doing the outside is
to<00:01:03.190> start<00:01:03.640> sanding<00:01:03.910> with<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.210> 320<00:01:04.960> grit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
to start sanding with a 320 grit

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.620 
to start sanding with a 320 grit
sandpaper<00:01:05.440> let's<00:01:06.430> go<00:01:06.580> over<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.090> pad<00:01:07.330> board

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
sandpaper let's go over to the pad board

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.359 
sandpaper let's go over to the pad board
a<00:01:07.690> minute<00:01:07.930> we<00:01:08.170> need<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.470> understand<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.130> grain

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
a minute we need to understand the grain

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.449 
a minute we need to understand the grain
orientation<00:01:09.850> happening<00:01:10.509> here<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:12.190> grain

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
orientation happening here the grain

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.580 
orientation happening here the grain
orientation<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.360> perpendicular<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.410> bed

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
orientation is perpendicular to the bed

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.639 
orientation is perpendicular to the bed
of<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.860> lathe<00:01:15.069> and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.840> need<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.200> make<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:17.530> the

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
of the lathe and we need to make on the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.130 
of the lathe and we need to make on the
outside<00:01:18.039> we<00:01:18.310> may<00:01:18.490> need<00:01:18.819> to<00:01:18.940> make<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> cut<00:01:19.479> from

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
outside we may need to make a cut from

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.130 
outside we may need to make a cut from
the<00:01:20.740> bottom<00:01:20.890> out<00:01:21.399> towards<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.209> rim<00:01:22.360> that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
the bottom out towards the rim that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.440 
the bottom out towards the rim that
means<00:01:23.440> those<00:01:23.679> safai<00:01:24.099> fibers<00:01:24.819> are<00:01:25.000> going<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.330> be

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
means those safai fibers are going to be

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.809 
means those safai fibers are going to be
supported<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.319> we<00:01:26.860> don't<00:01:27.069> tear<00:01:27.340> them<00:01:27.399> out<00:01:27.520> so

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
supported and we don't tear them out so

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.029 
supported and we don't tear them out so
the<00:01:28.030> push<00:01:28.240> cuts<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:28.990> normally<00:01:29.140> do<00:01:29.590> we'd

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
the push cuts that we normally do we'd

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.820 
the push cuts that we normally do we'd
have<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.149> cut<00:01:31.420> progressing<00:01:32.259> around<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> side

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
have the cut progressing around the side

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.219 
have the cut progressing around the side
well<00:01:33.099> I<00:01:33.280> can't<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:33.849> that<00:01:34.030> because<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.750> handle

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
well I can't do that because the handle

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.680 
well I can't do that because the handle
is<00:01:35.440> going<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.679> hit<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.069> head<00:01:36.190> stock<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.910> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
is going to hit the head stock and the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.109 
is going to hit the head stock and the
lathe<00:01:37.899> is<00:01:38.050> going<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.319> get<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.590> its<00:01:38.770> own<00:01:38.950> way<00:01:39.190> so

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
lathe is going to get in its own way so

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.639 
lathe is going to get in its own way so
I'm<00:01:40.300> going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> have<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.750> do<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.899> pull<00:01:41.229> cut<00:01:41.470> we're

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
I'm going to have to do a pull cut we're

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.410 
I'm going to have to do a pull cut we're
going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.860> learn<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.009> new<00:01:42.160> cut<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.700> do<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:43.119> and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
going to learn a new cut to do that and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.690 
going to learn a new cut to do that and
the<00:01:43.630> pull<00:01:43.869> cut<00:01:44.110> is<00:01:44.259> going<00:01:44.410> to<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:44.619> lowering<00:01:45.520> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the pull cut is going to be lowering the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.630 
the pull cut is going to be lowering the
handle<00:01:46.119> first<00:01:46.840> rule<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.289> lower<00:01:47.500> handle<00:01:48.009> second
