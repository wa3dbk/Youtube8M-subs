00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.030 
throughout my entire workout but as you
can<00:03:43.180> see<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.420> unfortunately<00:03:44.290> did<00:03:44.560> press<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
can see I unfortunately did press the

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.010 
can see I unfortunately did press the
start<00:03:45.370> button<00:03:45.430> since<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.480> thought<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.840> would

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
start button since I thought this would

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.080 
start button since I thought this would
just<00:03:47.170> track<00:03:47.500> my<00:03:47.709> fitness<00:03:48.010> or<00:03:48.400> my<00:03:48.550> activity

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
just track my fitness or my activity

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.540 
just track my fitness or my activity
without<00:03:49.450> me<00:03:49.810> having<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.140> do<00:03:50.380> anything<00:03:50.620> every

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
without me having to do anything every

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.010 
without me having to do anything every
single<00:03:51.730> time<00:03:52.060> you're<00:03:52.240> playing<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.870> either

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
single time you're playing to either

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.890 
single time you're playing to either
walk<00:03:53.440> or<00:03:53.709> perform<00:03:54.280> any<00:03:54.370> sort<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.760> exercise<00:03:55.090> you

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
walk or perform any sort of exercise you

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.990 
walk or perform any sort of exercise you
have<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:56.350> press<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.800> start<00:03:57.160> button<00:03:57.250> which<00:03:57.820> I

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
have to press the start button which I

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.600 
have to press the start button which I
feel<00:03:58.330> almost<00:03:58.750> defeats<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.500> purpose<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.160> is

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
feel almost defeats the purpose and is

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.240 
feel almost defeats the purpose and is
kind<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.060> setback<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.830> you'll<00:04:02.830> see<00:04:02.980> under

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
kind of a setback and you'll see under

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.040 
kind of a setback and you'll see under
the<00:04:03.280> exercise<00:04:03.820> tab<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.300> has<00:04:04.450> running<00:04:04.840> walking

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
the exercise tab it has running walking

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.740 
the exercise tab it has running walking
cycling<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.980> hiking<00:04:06.600> unfortunately<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.630> don't

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
cycling and hiking unfortunately I don't

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.080 
cycling and hiking unfortunately I don't
do<00:04:08.020> too<00:04:08.230> much<00:04:08.380> cardio<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.430> more<00:04:09.820> weight

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
do too much cardio and I do more weight

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.390 
do too much cardio and I do more weight
training<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:11.110> this<00:04:11.260> really<00:04:11.530> only<00:04:11.830> takes<00:04:12.160> into

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
training so this really only takes into

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.510 
training so this really only takes into
account<00:04:12.430> those<00:04:13.030> four<00:04:13.570> types<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.200> exercises<00:04:14.770> so

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
account those four types of exercises so

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.979 
account those four types of exercises so
if<00:04:15.610> you're<00:04:15.760> into<00:04:16.060> other<00:04:16.269> types<00:04:16.390> of<00:04:16.750> things

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
if you're into other types of things

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.140 
if you're into other types of things
like<00:04:17.260> myself<00:04:17.590> you'll<00:04:18.370> find<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.730> this<00:04:18.910> band

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
like myself you'll find that this band

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.819 
like myself you'll find that this band
isn't<00:04:19.359> as<00:04:19.690> accurate<00:04:19.900> as<00:04:20.350> some<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.680> its

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
isn't as accurate as some of its

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.870 
isn't as accurate as some of its
competitors<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:23.190> definitely<00:04:24.190> think<00:04:24.370> Samsung

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
competitors I definitely think Samsung

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.250 
competitors I definitely think Samsung
is<00:04:25.000> taking<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.390> lot<00:04:25.540> of<00:04:25.570> steps<00:04:25.840> in<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.110> right

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
is taking a lot of steps in the right

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.110 
is taking a lot of steps in the right
direction<00:04:26.320> with<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.010> latest<00:04:27.220> gear<00:04:27.490> fit<00:04:27.790> band

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
that feature in itself is a deal breaker

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.300 
that feature in itself is a deal breaker
second<00:04:49.870> off<00:04:49.990> battery<00:04:50.560> life<00:04:50.740> brings<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.130> lot

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
second off battery life brings a lot

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.310
