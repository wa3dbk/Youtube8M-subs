00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:08.920
 Yes We will introduce the night meal we eat on weekdays today 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.780
 At first we drank this vegetable juice 4 surgically soon 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.440
 And we Shah from depending on the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.160
 That after you make the thing was of the frozen food 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.710
 Dare I'm home finished now's chopsticks now 7:30 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:28.070
 It becomes this way this element in the first to eat in this part REIT 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.770
 It contains 82.5g of cis 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.390
 No. 14 with 53 g of carbohydrates 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:41.480
 Today it has become a ram of protein 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.440
 I had to eat a lot of carbs because I didn't eat much rice in the morning until dawn 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.810
 I'm sorry 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.850
 So you do not have to take about about after remaining certainly 200 grams 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.230
 So good evening has become a little high- carbohydrated rice and eat this first 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.720
 Well 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:03.730
 We are making a bar of Chinese restaurant Hisashima which is tinged with 8 microwaves 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.330
 This is yakisoba of Chinese style Nde then egg about 4 is made from now 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.330
 The taste is 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.920
 Usually with Japanese yakisoba began living in the described something's totally different taste This really is 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.240
 The black of the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.240
 so 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.549
 I used to usually go out low 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.110
 In the morning and afternoon I like to eat these things for reasons to use 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.860
 However, I have taken the quality according to your eyes It is about 24g knowing this 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.950
 It will sprout 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.080
 In and you say that you are using paper plates Nde this 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.150
 Just rough who do not like 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.900
 So this is always eating rice on that paper plate 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.280
 So it's snowing for everyone and this is only egg white 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.220
 First of all, but with the color of the yellow I look to the egg white Why'm the soul of the people fried eggs 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.860
 It's a room with no room, so this is a 40g protein and it's tonight 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.430
 Here you will find if there is fruit juice was the dessert 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.320
 This this is a mango-flavored juice 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.039
 It's 100% juice, so it looks like a little smoothie 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.739
 In delicious, but I'm a little flustered This is 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.790
 Guy that contains this Peach whether Honenchi Toka Man thing Ettoto 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.840
 In this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.319
 And 35g per cup 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.819
 It was back in carbohydrates and so one such ring in the US 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.310
 I eat it every time I buy it, so it's Fuji apple in Chinami 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.770
 After eating this 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.160
 Eat eight- turn gauss stuff ah 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.310
 So I want to go to sleep , so this is the last meal and where it looks like that French cruller 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.120
 Good potato chips 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.970
 We have it in this static 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.410
 Male cargo is about 30g at 6g 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.510
 In this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.379
 Today's dinner and one day 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.690
 I come home from myself and have dinner 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.890
 Although I ate a significant amount 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 I 'm still a little hungry, but I still eat too much 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.840
 Because I don't like eating too much before going to bed 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.310
 Eat water after 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.870
 The face drank so it is now 9:20 at 9:00 pm 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:26.620
 Thank you for taking a look and it will be my mother's bat tomorrow 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.370
