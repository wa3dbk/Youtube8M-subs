00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.099 
could stop some people on third down
we're<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.179> bad<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> defense<00:00:15.900> we're

really<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:17.449> we<00:00:18.449> weren't<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.900> good

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
really not and we weren't all that good

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.870 
really not and we weren't all that good
on<00:00:19.350> third<00:00:19.619> down<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:19.980> made<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> bunch<00:00:20.340> early<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
on third down we made a bunch early and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.330 
on third down we made a bunch early and
then<00:00:20.970> after<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.510> didn't<00:00:21.720> make<00:00:21.869> very<00:00:21.900> many

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
then after that we didn't make very many

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.939 
then after that we didn't make very many
but<00:00:23.340> Dillon<00:00:23.640> had<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.850> excellent<00:00:24.119> game<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
but Dillon had an excellent game and

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
but Dillon had an excellent game and
threw<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> ball<00:00:26.189> well<00:00:26.250> especially<00:00:26.910> first

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
threw the ball well especially first

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.179 
threw the ball well especially first
half<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.289> ran<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> ball<00:00:28.769> most

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
half and then we ran the ball most

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.089 
half and then we ran the ball most
second<00:00:29.519> half<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.500> but<00:00:31.500> I'd<00:00:31.590> say<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.920> thing

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
second half and but I'd say one thing

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.799 
second half and but I'd say one thing
when<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.369> had<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> stop<00:00:32.880> him<00:00:33.059> somehow<00:00:33.390> another

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
when we had to stop him somehow another

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.549 
when we had to stop him somehow another
we<00:00:34.230> stopped<00:00:34.530> him<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.370> got<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.559> intentional

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
we stopped him we got that intentional

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.190 
we stopped him we got that intentional
grounding<00:00:37.710> penalty<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.870> good<00:00:40.020> play

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
grounding penalty and that was good play

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.889 
grounding penalty and that was good play
for<00:00:40.379> us<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> key<00:00:42.480> plays<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
for us so as one of the key plays in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.990 
for us so as one of the key plays in
whole<00:00:43.020> ball<00:00:43.260> game<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:44.370> interesting

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
whole ball game that was interesting

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
whole ball game that was interesting
they<00:00:45.210> they<00:00:45.750> ran<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> play<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> guess<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> don't

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
they they ran that play I guess I don't

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
they they ran that play I guess I don't
know<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.450> an<00:00:49.050> inner<00:00:49.260> kid<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.010> guess<00:00:50.280> he

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
know but if an inner kid I guess he

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
know but if an inner kid I guess he
hadn't<00:00:50.579> missed<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.789> field<00:00:50.969> goal<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.449> two<00:00:51.809> years

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
hadn't missed a field goal in two years

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
hadn't missed a field goal in two years
or<00:00:52.260> something<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.010> 20<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> row<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
or something like that 20 in a row a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that could have come back to haunt us

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
that could have come back to haunt us
but<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.630> found<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> random<00:01:13.080> ball<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.530> decent

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
but we found a random ball pretty decent

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
but we found a random ball pretty decent
Brandon<00:01:14.400> wild<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.729> had<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.150> runs

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
Brandon wild it's had some good runs

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
Brandon wild it's had some good runs
Mike<00:01:15.689> had<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> few<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.320> ones<00:01:16.500> yeah<00:01:17.280> Brandon

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Mike had a few good ones yeah Brandon

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.210 
Mike had a few good ones yeah Brandon
almost<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> hundred<00:01:18.450> yards<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.070> was

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
almost had a hundred yards so that was

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
almost had a hundred yards so that was
good<00:01:20.369> other<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.060> went<00:01:21.450> backwards

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
good other than that we went backwards

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.499 
good other than that we went backwards
way<00:01:22.049> too<00:01:22.110> much<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> run<00:01:23.130> game<00:01:23.509> Georgia's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
way too much in the run game Georgia's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.440 
way too much in the run game Georgia's
defense<00:01:25.670> well<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.850> were<00:01:26.939> pretty<00:01:27.150> good<00:01:27.270> at

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
defense well they were pretty good at

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
defense well they were pretty good at
times<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> other<00:01:28.200> times<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.650> guess<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:28.950> they

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
times and other times I guess they they

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.080 
times and other times I guess they they
weren't<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.090> quite<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.909> we're<00:01:32.909> able

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
weren't as quite as good but we're able

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
weren't as quite as good but we're able
to<00:01:33.210> score<00:01:33.390> touchdowns<00:01:33.930> almost<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> our

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to score touchdowns almost all of our

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
to score touchdowns almost all of our
drives<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.729> guess<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> kick<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
drives and I guess we want to kick the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
drives and I guess we want to kick the
one<00:01:36.780> field<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.290> right<00:01:37.619> down<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> half

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
one field go right down in the half

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.149 
one field go right down in the half
which<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.810> always<00:01:39.810> crucial<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.530> coach<00:01:40.829> games

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
which was always crucial and coach games

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.359 
which was always crucial and coach games
is<00:01:41.670> scoring<00:01:42.060> touchdowns<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.740> feel<00:01:44.340> very

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
is scoring touchdowns so we feel very
