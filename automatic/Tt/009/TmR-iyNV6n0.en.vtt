did<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> bought<00:01:29.600> store<00:01:30.600> hair<00:01:30.840> guy<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
did was I bought store hair guy and I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
did was I bought store hair guy and I
don't<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.340> happened<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
don't know I don't know what happened I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.800 
don't know I don't know what happened I
think<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.009> bought<00:01:35.909> brown<00:01:36.509> hair

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
think it's because I bought brown hair

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
think it's because I bought brown hair
dye<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.560> Sally<00:01:37.829> isn't<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.700> just

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
dye at like Sally isn't it it just

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
dye at like Sally isn't it it just
didn't<00:01:39.180> come<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> color<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.079> wanted<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
didn't come out the color I wanted it to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
didn't come out the color I wanted it to
so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> getting<00:01:42.540> frustrated<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so I was kind of getting frustrated and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980 
so I was kind of getting frustrated and
the<00:01:43.590> only<00:01:43.829> store<00:01:44.009> open<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.460> Walmart<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the only store open was Walmart and so I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
the only store open was Walmart and so I
opted<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.320> hair<00:01:46.590> dye<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.369> actually

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
opted for hair dye but it actually

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
opted for hair dye but it actually
turned<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> better<00:01:48.329> because<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
turned out from the better because it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
turned out from the better because it
worked<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.140> perfectly<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> hair

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

suggested time is like twenty to thirty
minutes<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.840> left<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.140> on<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.290> 30

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
that I was kind of sad about was when I

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.490

was watching out the brown dye obviously
I'm<00:03:38.709> kind<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.489> like<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.940> my

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
I'm kind of like going like this to my

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.790 
I'm kind of like going like this to my
hair<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.780> brought<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.140> down<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.470> my<00:03:41.590> blonde

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
hair it brought it down to my blonde

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.410 
hair it brought it down to my blonde
hair<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.310> actually<00:03:42.459> made<00:03:42.790> my<00:03:42.940> blonde<00:03:43.180> hair

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
hair and it actually made my blonde hair

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.590 
hair and it actually made my blonde hair
a<00:03:43.450> little<00:03:43.570> bit<00:03:43.780> darker<00:03:44.170> um<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:46.180> my<00:03:46.239> blonde

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
a little bit darker um because my blonde

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.150 
a little bit darker um because my blonde
hair<00:03:46.690> was<00:03:46.930> really<00:03:47.110> light<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.650> that's<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.920> only

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
hair was really light so that's the only

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.830 
hair was really light so that's the only
thing<00:03:48.340> but<00:03:48.550> it's<00:03:48.670> okay<00:03:48.940> because<00:03:48.970> there's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
thing but it's okay because there's

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.949 
thing but it's okay because there's
nothing<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.140> toner<00:03:50.560> can't<00:03:51.040> fix<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.959> that's

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
nothing that toner can't fix so that's

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.110 
nothing that toner can't fix so that's
the<00:03:53.050> only<00:03:53.110> downside<00:03:53.410> but<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.190> mean<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.700> left<00:03:54.940> my

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
the only downside but I mean it left my

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.690 
the only downside but I mean it left my
hair<00:03:55.360> feeling<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:56.560> nice<00:03:56.739> after<00:03:57.070> it<00:03:57.610> was

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700

like the perfect shade I feel like it's
not<00:04:00.459> too<00:04:00.670> dark<00:04:00.880> but<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.239> not<00:04:01.390> too<00:04:01.600> light<00:04:01.870> it

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
like this one and mind you my roots were

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.620 
like this one and mind you my roots were
like<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:16.870> long<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.310> had<00:04:18.729> like<00:04:18.910> virgin<00:04:19.479> hair

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
like this long so I had like virgin hair

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.479 
like this long so I had like virgin hair
here<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.140> then<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.320> had<00:04:20.530> died<00:04:20.770> here<00:04:21.130> here

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
here and then I had died here here

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.980 
here and then I had died here here
but<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.819> actually<00:04:21.970> turned<00:04:22.389> out<00:04:22.509> the<00:04:22.960> same

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
but it actually turned out the same

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.309 
but it actually turned out the same
exact<00:04:23.500> color<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.970> mean<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.300> was<00:04:25.599> pretty<00:04:25.840> lucky

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:26.319 
exact color so I mean I was pretty lucky

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.290 
exact color so I mean I was pretty lucky
I<00:04:26.349> guess<00:04:26.650> but<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.310> just<00:04:27.460> worked<00:04:27.699> out<00:04:27.819> perfectly

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
I guess but it just worked out perfectly

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.510 
I guess but it just worked out perfectly
so<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.870> really<00:04:29.500> really<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.919> this<00:04:30.099> this<00:04:30.340> stuff
