shortly<00:00:22.700> it's<00:00:23.119> probably<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.510> loudest<00:00:23.689> alarm

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
shortly it's probably the loudest alarm

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.170 
shortly it's probably the loudest alarm
I've<00:00:24.260> ever<00:00:24.500> heard<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.580> basically<00:00:25.880> what<00:00:26.090> this

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
I've ever heard so basically what this

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.580 
I've ever heard so basically what this
is<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.510> very<00:00:26.900> simple<00:00:27.230> battery-operated

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
is is a very simple battery-operated

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.370 
is is a very simple battery-operated
lock<00:00:28.190> box<00:00:28.460> with<00:00:29.119> a<00:00:29.150> steel<00:00:29.630> cable<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.230> allows

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
lock box with a steel cable that allows

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.049 
lock box with a steel cable that allows
you<00:00:30.530> to<00:00:30.619> tie<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:30.890> down<00:00:31.010> to<00:00:31.369> whatever<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:31.850> want

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
you to tie it down to whatever you want

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.540 
you to tie it down to whatever you want
so<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.870> good<00:00:33.350> example<00:00:33.770> of<00:00:33.920> where<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.250> use<00:00:34.400> this

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
so a good example of where to use this

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.189 
so a good example of where to use this
would<00:00:34.699> be<00:00:34.850> let's<00:00:35.510> say<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.660> want<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:35.930> keep<00:00:36.080> your

little device now it's got a three
button<00:01:04.040> pin<00:01:04.370> code<00:01:04.549> on<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.760> front<00:01:05.000> where

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
button pin code on the front where

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.020 
button pin code on the front where
basically<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.440> can<00:01:06.560> assign<00:01:06.799> any<00:01:07.520> pin<00:01:07.790> code

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
basically you can assign any pin code

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.789
