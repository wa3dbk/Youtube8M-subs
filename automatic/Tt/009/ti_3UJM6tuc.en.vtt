00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.469
 You want to talk about right box

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.270

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.730
 from brazil and we come together to do 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 a video called the secret of my 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 puppies we will all make videos for 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.170
 16 counting the habits that people 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 Usually do what we found out. 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 you too 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 You must be finding it strange that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 I 'm in a different place and here's the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.939
 room where I want to make the videos 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 recorded by the ces has ideas is 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.229
 video competition and is still in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 construction for now only have this to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.880
 heart here behind you are seeing 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 right that the photos and is white and is a panel 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680
 that puts and crosses is still focusing on 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.720
 So do not worry, it's good. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.759
 showing you when you get ready 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.159
 some details will show you're 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.610
 Good. Let's go to the secrets of mine. 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.610
 curls 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:49.040
 to have good and eaters trafficked from ats 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.840
 What I most care about is bedtime. 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.300
 because the time the hair can mess 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.060
 everything likes to do two things to 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 keep my curls or the poly 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 completely loose only on the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.780
 satin I like to sleep with him in jail 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 with pineapple and a satin pillowcase 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.310
 these two ways I like them the most 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600
 saves my cars so I 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.100
 I like to make a mix 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.230
 spray with cream oil and water 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.130
 the goal of the ox spoke the days he did not 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.710
 is very good 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.180
 It's on the next third day or in the room 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.520
 but it is not always 2 finalization 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.520
 I always do it in my hair when I 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.740
 I'll finish it at the time of the crime. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.150
 always make mix looks with cream 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.680
 often 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.360
 I just do not mix when I feel like 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 he does not need to fit in 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.520
 wheat is interesting that the oil is 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.480
 100% natural my favorite is coconut 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.770
 and olive oil 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560
 another thing I like to do in 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.690
 finalization is the tape technique gem is the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.209
 my favorite uncertainty that is 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.920
 favorite of several curts for whom 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.380
 Do not know what it's like to stay, I'm leaving. 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 a video explaining to you what you want 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.390
 and me, I'm going to leave it here for you. 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.209
 It's a technique that I'm 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.580
 here to make the curls 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.330
 beautiful is the one you did not know 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.090
 assurance 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.580
 separating curls for curls in 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.650
 time to finish because I'm going to 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.900
 image as I 'm doing to you 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.880
 see more or less and that's what I'm 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.830
 making with the curls stay so looks 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.790
 very loose 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.190
 3 Care a beautiful hair he has is 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.050
 well treated, let's combine 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.790
 in fact I think that the hair too 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.790
 Sometimes you do not need anything, it's beautiful. 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.190
 but I need you, I'm laughing 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.390
 lazy then what do I do when I 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.910
 I will take care of my hair do 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 hydration and reconstruction I usually 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.230
 use the mark on the shower 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.989
 it's very practical 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.580
 There were a few minutes and you did not lose. 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.620
 because here in Japan it is very 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.750
 That's why I'm running. 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 making more appointments in the bath and more 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.959
 a thing that leaves the hair well 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.360
 doses are the cuts we I always 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.530
 I make small cuts of six to eight 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.420
 months 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.400
 times I've left a year without 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.420
 cut but it's because I felt that my 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.280
 hair was good touches healthy tips 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.890
 4 wash 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.859
 I think the avaÃ­ is superimportant because 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.570
 time to clean hair but at this time 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.210
 I like to use at least the most shampoo 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.970
 Possible nature is here in Japan. 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.000
 again failed to find shocked 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.030
 so it is better for those who do not have the 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.300
 fact that does not contain parabens is not 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.310
 Whenever the meeting is, but I'm looking for 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.260
 then most imported products to in 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.130
 shops of imported something else is 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.530
 doing before washing the root with shampoo 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.220
 first of all I put the controller 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.590
 our hair straightening all over 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.410
 because it will become more malleable in the 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.539
 When I go there I go there with shampoo and 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.849
 It will get easier for hair 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.680
 unlock know and avoid falling more 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.650
 some time ago I had a little bit because 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.419
 It is a teacher who fell a little more then 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.550
 I'm doing this for my hair, not 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.340
 also mop up after I 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.010
 I did it all I always get singing teaser 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.090
 and I brush hair and yes I down 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.729
 underwater 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.470
 to finish and left the threads that always 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.930
 they come out naturally from curly hair 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.080
 Curly is all the hair in a fall 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.669
 normal only curly curly hair 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.860
 what happens when he leaves 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.930
 naturally from the scalp it gets 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.990
 in here he will not run alone 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.539
 like straight hair is then 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.220
 This I do this, my hair usually 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.330
 very knot is a very difficult hair of 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:49.490
 then this helps me a lot 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.830
 washing 5 free and last I want 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.860
 talking about taxes is something that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.750
 people worry about everything and try 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.750
 to avoid but the cold is a natural thing 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.020
 our hair and particularly mine. 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.599
 The secret is that I do not call sincerely. 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.699
 I'm very happy with frizz 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.590
 My relationship is very good today. 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.280
 Hair is cold over here. 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.039
