00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.292
"Proof"

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.542
Well well well, you weren't planning
on eating the whole jar, or were you?

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.750
You better put it back where you found it,
or I'll tell Mom and Dad what you did!

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.292
And I'll tell them we didn't do it.

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:30.333
You can't prove anything

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.458
To... Dad

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.125
Yummy tummy!

00:00:58.126 --> 00:01:02.500
So good!

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.707
Gimme some!

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:09.400
How's this? Here's your proof!
They're going to be so

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:13.732
disappointed in you! Dad'll be
looking at his copy any minute!

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:17.249
Come back here! Liza! Give me that picture!!

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.000
Please Liza! We would never do this to you!

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.708
Kids, why are you still up? It's really late.
Come on now, get to bed.

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.333
Goodnight Dad! Have a good sleep!

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:29.708
Get going you two.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:43.583
Liza!

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.250
Hey Liza! That was great! You got us good!

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.223
Yeah you did. And it was
so cool you didn't tell

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:52.982
Dad. You had us really
scared there for a minute!

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.250
It was really smart of you to show
us the picture. We both bought it!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.792
Well of course we believed her.
She's always been clever. Right?

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:07.083
Oh yeah, the smartest in the family!
Since she was a baby!

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.625
Yeah and one of the prettiest ones too!

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.039
Here, go see that new movie
with Brad Pitt Bull. I was

00:02:13.064 --> 00:02:16.249
gonna go with my friends
but, (react) you go instead!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.912
Look! You can wear this new top
to the movie. I just bought

00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:23.146
it, but you should have it.
You'll look beautiful!!!

00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:26.250
We can trust her with anything now.
She's one of us!

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:33.542
Wait here! I need to brush my teeth!

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:41.542
Well hello there!

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:47.167
Oh yeah hey Dad. Have you... I
mean, did you find something Oh!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.292
No, what is it that you're looking for?

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.708
Uh, it's a, never mind!

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:59.708
This might be much harder than I
originally thought it would be.

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:04.249
Hey Dad! It's breakfast time!
Better go to the kitchen!

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.457
Thank you Liza but I already ate.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:07.458
Oh...

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.417
Hi again, don't mind me, just sweeping
up a bit, you just sit right there!

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:19.208
Liza, I appreciate your help, but
I'm trying to do some work. OK?

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:23.125
Yeah sure.

00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:39.942
She was a clever girl. The
smartest girl in the entire world.

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.541
Sure no one appreciated, but
that's all about to be changing!

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:46.082
It's all about to be changing!!

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.792
Liza!! Liza!

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.250
Liza! Your teeth must be clean by now!

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:52.875
Look! What's this??

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:56.792
Well well... "To Dad."

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:00.833
Liza what are you doing, hmm?
You're being kinda weird.

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:04.889
Maybe there's something you want
to tell me, maybe about someone

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:08.399
eating all the jelly?? Do you
know who that was by any chance?

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:14.708
Maybe. And maybe not. But I can't say!
Who knows!...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.333
Oh Liza! Here you are!

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.708
Hi Dad! We found this for you.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.833
Oh yeah? What is it?

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.208
Well this solves that mystery!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
What?!

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:32.792
Um... I

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:35.458
Freeze!!!

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:36.617
Come back here!!
