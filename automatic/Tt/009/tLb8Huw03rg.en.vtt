00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.049
 hello to everyone in the past video showed 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.360
 oil positional timings on the map 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.800
 dust2 they were not many but now I 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.840
 show you more variations 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 and developments on the mirage map so 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.430
 let's start and perhaps start with 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 confrontation of all times and peoples 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.780
 pet as you see with respect 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.580
 blizhniki spawn of both teams and the protection 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 has a slight advantage over its 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:40.170
 opponents to press carpets on 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.790
 defense requires 10 attack code to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.750
 know this position is required on that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.750
 second less time 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.750
 and now the next development 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.240
 events to and from and it happened 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 pins and requires about 12 seconds and 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.810
 protection to control this point with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.290
 positions on heads need three seconds 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.290
 less 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.810
 although from connector to mid or just 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.130
 looking through the point of defense is worth being 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.899
 careful since the attack will 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.460
 take control of a connection much earlier 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:23.200
 how to make a player defense to attack 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.909
 get out of the tunnel at near executing 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
 all he needs to be careful since 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.390
 protection player even with long-term risk 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.219
 occupies the connector and will control the output 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:42.939
 tonal 5 seconds earlier than done 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:44.530
 a terrorist saying zigzags then there is a clear 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.239
 losing side of timing defense 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.220
 since terrorist even with distant 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.259
 a sheet will control this point at 4 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.189
 seconds earlier than defense player 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.189
 with near and evil 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 if we talk about carpets on b will give light 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.750
 we are equally in time not further 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.179
 grow events leaving you something with you 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
 had a scallop channel and blown off subscribe 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.970
 put likes to all good luck and see you soon 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970
 meeting
