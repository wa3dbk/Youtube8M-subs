gain access so I don't know at what
point<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.570> actually<00:00:52.050> happens<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
point that actually happens because I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
point that actually happens because I
just<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> discovered<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.870> by

just kind of like discovered this by by
accident<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> more<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> by<00:00:57.809> air

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
accident it's kind of more of a by air

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
accident it's kind of more of a by air
type<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> happens<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.370> just<00:01:02.370> keep

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you where you raised fib headquarters

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.929 
you where you raised fib headquarters
you<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:10.939> unparalleled

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you kind of just have like unparalleled

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.590 
you kind of just have like unparalleled
access<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.170> fine<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:15.479> any

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
access to it and that's fine so in any

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.590 
access to it and that's fine so in any
case<00:01:16.430> what<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> gain<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.119> you're<00:01:18.299> then

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
case what you gain that then you're then

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.179 
case what you gain that then you're then
you're<00:01:18.720> good<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.409> roll<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I think about it is that then you can

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.280 
I think about it is that then you can
actually<00:01:24.119> buy<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> helipad<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.950> downtown<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290

actually buy the helipad in downtown and
for<00:01:28.290> both<00:01:28.439> Michael<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> course

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
for both Michael and then of course

for both Michael and then of course
Franklin<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.060> Trevor<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.509> course<00:01:30.689> has

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Franklin and then Trevor of course has

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
kind of works the same way as a fighter

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.000 
kind of works the same way as a fighter

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.040 
ever wondering how to shoot you push
your<00:04:12.860> on<00:04:13.220> 360<00:04:13.970> put<00:04:14.239> your<00:04:14.360> X<00:04:14.480> button<00:04:14.720> recycle

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
your on 360 put your X button recycle

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.270 
your on 360 put your X button recycle
your<00:04:15.110> weapon<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.530> have<00:04:15.650> Rockets<00:04:15.950> machine

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
your weapon so you have Rockets machine

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.030 
your weapon so you have Rockets machine
gun<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.239> then<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.510> push<00:04:17.810> your<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.530> button<00:04:18.799> to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
gun and then you push your a button to

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.409 
gun and then you push your a button to
shoot<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.790> should<00:04:19.910> be<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.090> same<00:04:20.209> thing

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
shoot and it should be the same thing

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.030 
shoot and it should be the same thing
for<00:04:20.450> PlayStation<00:04:21.049> 3<00:04:21.079> for<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.620> layout

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
for PlayStation 3 for that layout

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.610 
for PlayStation 3 for that layout
which<00:04:22.669> would<00:04:22.820> be<00:04:22.910> what<00:04:23.120> Square<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.990> think<00:04:24.350> for

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
which would be what Square I think for

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.950 
which would be what Square I think for
your<00:04:24.770> rockets<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.639> machine<00:04:25.700> gun<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:26.870> it

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
your rockets and machine gun and then it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.310 
your rockets and machine gun and then it
would<00:04:27.050> be<00:04:27.169> your<00:04:27.260> X<00:04:27.470> button<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.240> shoot<00:04:29.320> now

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
would be your X button to shoot now

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.990 
would be your X button to shoot now
again<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.710> push<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.310> too<00:04:31.490> like<00:04:31.610> button

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
again you can push that too like button

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.310 
again you can push that too like button
to<00:04:32.240> change<00:04:32.780> your<00:04:33.020> views<00:04:33.290> however<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:33.950> want<00:04:34.160> to
