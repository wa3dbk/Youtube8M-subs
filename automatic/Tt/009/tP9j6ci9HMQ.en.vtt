rice and i chose to use the brown rice
instant<00:00:37.020> I've<00:00:37.700> got<00:00:38.700> dumb<00:00:39.180> let's<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.860> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
instant I've got dumb let's say that can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.920 
instant I've got dumb let's say that can
of<00:00:41.340> diced<00:00:41.550> tomatoes<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:43.070> can<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.090> fat<00:00:45.629> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of diced tomatoes a can of the fat this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
of diced tomatoes a can of the fat this
is<00:00:46.079> ninety-eight<00:00:46.620> percent<00:00:46.800> fat<00:00:47.250> free<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is ninety-eight percent fat free and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
is ninety-eight percent fat free and
forty<00:00:48.180> five<00:00:48.390> percent<00:00:48.420> less<00:00:49.260> sodium<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
forty five percent less sodium so I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
forty five percent less sodium so I
think<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> sodium<00:00:51.059> value<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:52.489> let's<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:54.260> 460

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
think the sodium value is let's see 460

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
think the sodium value is let's see 460
I<00:00:55.500> believe<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> fat-free<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.629> was

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I believe on the fat-free can it was

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
I believe on the fat-free can it was
close<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> 800<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> can't<00:00:59.730> even

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
close to 800 and I don't I can't even

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
close to 800 and I don't I can't even
tell<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> regular<00:01:01.440> can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
tell you what it was on the regular can

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
tell you what it was on the regular can
a<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.910> corn<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> peppers<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
a can of corn with the peppers and I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.280 
a can of corn with the peppers and I
think<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.610> has<00:01:05.790> peppers<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.540> we've

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
think it just has peppers in there we've

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
think it just has peppers in there we've
got<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.740> 2%<00:01:08.610> cheese<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.360> low-fat<00:01:09.750> cheese

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
got some 2% cheese the low-fat cheese

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.350 
got some 2% cheese the low-fat cheese

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
going to even though they're not low-fat

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to even though they're not low-fat
we're<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> whole<00:01:14.820> lot<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you see in here that we're going for the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
you see in here that we're going for the
less<00:01:21.420> sodium<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.560> prawn<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.220> the

this in

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.580 
this in
that's<00:01:44.870> good<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:48.800> we've<00:01:48.950> got<00:01:49.159> our<00:01:49.190> baking<00:01:49.790> dish

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
that's good so we've got our baking dish

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
that's good so we've got our baking dish
just<00:01:51.590> spray<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.220> bit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.440 

I<00:02:04.340> believe<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.490> dump<00:02:05.880> everything<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
I believe we just dump everything in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
I believe we just dump everything in
here<00:02:06.660> at<00:02:07.500> least<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.039> did<00:02:08.220> before

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
here at least that's what I did before

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
here at least that's what I did before
okay<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.119> we're<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.539> our<00:02:09.630> two<00:02:09.929> cups

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.770 

if<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> scale<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.640> would<00:03:25.030> work<00:03:25.210> to<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
if you have a scale that would work to a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:37.520

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
this is a pretty good easy recipe I

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.270 
this is a pretty good easy recipe I
think<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.319> real<00:03:48.560> hearty<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:50.980> think<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.099> could

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
think it's real hearty I think you could

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.369 
think it's real hearty I think you could
get<00:03:52.430> by<00:03:52.640> with<00:03:52.670> not<00:03:53.209> really<00:03:53.659> believing<00:03:54.049> that

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
get by with not really believing that

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.280 
get by with not really believing that
this<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:55.790> know<00:03:55.909> if<00:03:56.330> you're<00:03:56.540> kind<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.019> like

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
this is you know if you're kind of like

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.539 
this is you know if you're kind of like
oh<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:58.239> got<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.330> have<00:03:59.480> really<00:03:59.750> crappy<00:04:00.019> food<00:04:00.440> I

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.270 

think<00:04:04.549> this<00:04:04.700> would<00:04:04.970> be<00:04:05.180> one<00:04:05.450> where<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:07.160> know

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
think this would be one where you know

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.910 
think this would be one where you know
there's<00:04:07.549> there's<00:04:07.849> a<00:04:07.970> lot<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.299> chicken<00:04:08.920> nacho

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
there's there's a lot of chicken nacho

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.479 
there's there's a lot of chicken nacho
chicken<00:04:10.250> casseroles<00:04:10.849> out<00:04:11.060> there<00:04:15.190> and<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.310> think

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
chicken casseroles out there and I think

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.120 
chicken casseroles out there and I think
this<00:04:16.639> is<00:04:16.789> all<00:04:17.030> too<00:04:17.359> about<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.350> watching<00:04:19.100> what

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130
