00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 good to install it we 're going to go to 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.149
 town lapse because you are going to leave 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.039
 at home and good once and where we 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.800
 let's go 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.539
 down to where it says do not jailbreak this 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.880
 it means that we do not need 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.220
 jailbreak to have this emulator that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 it's something pretty good and good 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.720
 how can you see the procedure is via 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.130
 ota what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.880
 tap and it will ask us if we want to install it 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.880
 emulator in this case let's give it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.080
 install and it will appear to us here is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.960
 installing an this an application that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.450
 be in this case is the emulator as 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.640
 you can see and good friends once and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.670
 the installation process is finished 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.880
 this is your good icon let's go into 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.210
 him to see a bit of the interface like 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.160
 can see this is the interface like 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.270
 can see I have two games installed 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.280
 which is mario kart ds and he is super 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.709
 mario bros and then you are going to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 ask how they are going to install games or 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.080
 roms one is very simple for that we 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.390
 let's go to this plus icon or symbol 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.040

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.230
 the most downloaded games the 25 most 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.129

 is and volume really to install 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.750

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.930

 will appear here a tab that is 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.980
 downloading the game but good once 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.310
 since they downloaded the game if they 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.849
 we give that we will leave the options 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.970
