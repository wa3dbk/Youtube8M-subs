00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.760
 but left the second goal are finding 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.790
 here in this bagasse and today you have 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.190
 speed of that screen being made to the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 talk about my friend dm 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'm going to leave his channel on the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.010
 description for you to know 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.020
 the field of who comes from the hour 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720
 so this is personal do not forget the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.789
 life and spread this bag 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.500
 because the channel needs subscribers to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 get partnership with youtube 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.560
 took time to watch the video until the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 I'll be answering some 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.059
 questions that arose did not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.059
 is it worth then talked so much that just 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 i 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.970
 i 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.700
 Gift I'm going to answer some 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.890
 questions were to realize that teaching 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.510
 At the most ask of them I was 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.400
 selling these screens 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.210
 so I'm just selling for now 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.560
 for bh here count of mines and 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.110
 the following is what I have in mind 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.960
 ahead of the channel is 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.890
 painting these screens is bypassing the 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.530
 enrolled 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.959
 the second question was which try z 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.300
 in this first screen on the second screen I used this 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.850
 ink that is an ink for 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.440
 acrilex just for now my fifth best 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.020
 that she has better and harder protection 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 more time on the screen is the color of it lasts 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.620
 but this is the one who calls the ink 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.450
 acrylic here also the third 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.190
 question was on which marker that 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.380
 I used to do the details 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.750
 I used this from here east too 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.810
 It seems that I'm doing advertising for 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.090
 they but I'm not I do not know how 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.250
 is that you will understand this bag more 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.400
 is the following I used this marker here 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.440
 and there are probably better ones 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.600
 The fourth question was about what I used 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.360
 to brighten and protect the screen I 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.580
 I used a normal varnish says black does not have 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.060
 very mysterious that this is not special 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.739
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.519
 today you saw this screen that being 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.710
 done 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.990
 so this is personal do not forget life 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.090
 Favorite I said and do not forget too 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.650
 to advertise and delete your channel needs 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.320
 of subscribers was achieved the partnership 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.320
