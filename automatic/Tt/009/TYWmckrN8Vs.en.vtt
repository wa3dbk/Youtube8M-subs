 just a link and when I finish 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.910
 like this one that is a compressed file 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.740
 with the name we rex 1.2 points 51 ticia 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 for all of you who asked to be 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.570
 will use a new version of minecraft and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.310
 why we have not done it and we have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.550
 gone to the last official version of 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.380
 minecraft that is 1.2 point 5 so 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.240
 apart from enjoying the mods that we are going to 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.860
 install can also have the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.750
 benefits offered by the version of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.020
 minecraft 1.2 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 now this file we are going to open it or what 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 you can give in extract here with you 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.520
 wish and you will find these folders and a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.050
 exe file can drag it to your 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.380
 desk that is what I have done and 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.270
 here I have them the first folder has 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 as name install the willy rex 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 obviously this is the program that we are going 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.440
 to execute to install the mods or 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 select the and the second folder 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.410
 has the name to empty in roaming this 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 We will open the folder and you will find 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.430
 a point minecraft is about 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.399
 minecraft what they are going to do is go to their 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.810
 roaming folder on your computer and if 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.670
 you have a point folder 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 Previous minecraft will eliminate it by 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 complete once you have removed 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.820
 they will copy what is inside the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 folder is going to be roaming which is this 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.789
 folder drag it to roaming and ready 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 This is a clean installation of 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.350
 minecraft will you have a version 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960
 intact and is necessary to be able 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 install the mods package 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.310
 many wonder that as they put 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 wrong to enter clean from where they discharge 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.170
 etcetera so I have better decided 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 add it and it's a compatible version with 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.360
 this install so use this folder 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.239
 that is inside empty in roaming and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.610
 move it and they will have a clean version 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.590
 of Minecraft 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.510
 and the third file that is inside the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.790
 compressed is this launcher for 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.980
 run minecraft this is for those who 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.110
 they do not have a premium account and if you have 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.540
 a premium account so ignore 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 of the third file because then you can 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860
 use the original file that you can 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.960
 download from the website but this what 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.550
 I do for non-premium users for 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.540
 users not awarded can run 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.000
 this launcher and they will be able to start minecraft 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.800
 now once they have made the step of 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.740
 copy the minecraft point folder in 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.230
 roaming let's open the install folder 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.750
 willy rex and let's run the file 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 java that is this that has as its name 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.330
 installer this is another good news 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.100
 for the users who asked to be 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.590
 could select in the launcher the 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.080
 mods that they wanted to put so too 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.330
 will work for mac then simply 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.100
 read the instructions that are here 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.990
 which are the ones that I just summarized 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.030
 and give in next 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.980
 once they have next will appear the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.660
 list of modes that we can install 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.000
 and you can here in the box 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.820
 select those who want to install the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 first box are the bases or what 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.990
 it is needed for the other mods 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.510
 work as the module to see the forge 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.040
 the audio mod etcetera then the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.900
 first box does not need to be 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450
 mark nothing will happen because the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.040
 install by default where you should 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.470
 to install the ones in the second box 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.210
 down so they can put the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.520
 Mods who want 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.890
 willy rex will be using all the 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.590
 mods so if you want you'll have the same 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.020
 to the willis rex you can put the list 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.840
 you enter in the ideation tab 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.330
 full and install everyone once 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.690
 you have selected the mods in next 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.200
 and we wait for him to install those modes that 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.200
 we select 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.919
 ok when I finish this bar it will fill up and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.919
 will appear finalized in the window 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.969
 very good and I finish as you see 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.740
 finished and we click on the button where 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.300
 then the install will be planted but 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.119
 because we already have all the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.860
 modes within minecraft now let's 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:01.400
 run minecraft so we can see 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.380
 the menu 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.050
 and let's see that we enter without any 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.360
 problem gambling has not redeemed 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.030
 no type of error we also need 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.539
 something important for all of you to have 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.550
 java in version 7 because if you have the 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.110
 version 6 may have some problems 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.169
 then it is recommended that you have the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.430
 version 7 of java then here we are 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.490
 inside the minecraft menu in the 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.320
 version 1.2 point 5 and as you see there is no 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.900
 no problem to enter we are already 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.780
 in the menu and we have all the mods 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.940
 installed so this is very simple if 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.400
 you still have some doubt or some 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.740
 problem you can let me know by 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.570
 twitter we try to answer all 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.760
 those who send us questions on twitter 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.470
 although sometimes it's something complicated like that 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.500
 I ask for patience for all 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.940
 that maybe he does not answer them but it's very 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.650
 simple here are the instructions 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.440
 follow what it is and I will not have any 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.300
 problem then I hope you have them 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.880
