00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 and we started this week with a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 presentation that is important for 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.759
 we present today to di wild 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.690
 his full name is ed and wild 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.690
 pascual israfil filos 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.930
 he is a footballer who although he is born in 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.390
 roquetas del mar have nationality of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.480
 Azerbaijan and is international by the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 selection of azerbaijan as you know in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160
 As for its characteristics, this is the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.559
 player who plays in midfield 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.519
 physically strong with arrival with golf 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.769
 and good for football fans you know that 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.900
 last year he played with the grenade and makes 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.160
 two years had a very prominent role in 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.280
 that murcia that finished third in the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 classification 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.370
 at a technical level, because power stands out 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.379
 physical that he has his size the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.649
 stride that is a player with a lot 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.920
 travel and that also drives well the 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.280
 ball 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.770
 therefore it is a further reinforcement for 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.159
 we the third one we give you the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.009
 welcome to eibar say that makes us 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.220
 very excited that he is here today and that 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.700
 you know that is coming from real murcia 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.590
 in the contract has a year 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.100
 and an option at the end at the end of said 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.100
 contract 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.440
 fought enough for that possibility 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.990
 from there we 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.200
 I would highlight the interest you have shown 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.290
 to come here effectively as I said 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.520
 france and how good has there been some other 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.950
 first division team that also 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080
 has shown interest in him not and that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.780
 I came to the eibar, I think it's something 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.970
 you have to start highlighting the year 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 past we saw the difficulties that 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.670
 we had to sign to be our 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.090
 first year in the first division 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.220
 and good the three additions that already 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 we have done for this season because 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.980
 we see a little that are the first 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.480
 options that we shuffled and this 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.580
 it's a major change from what 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.410
 what 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.660
 It was happening last year because 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.060
 many times the first options are 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.120
 they escaped us because they decided to go to others 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.120
 teams 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 we have to be satisfied 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.870
 until the signature is done because it is not 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 can not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.489
 much 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.610
 I believe that 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.780
 very good for me both sportingly 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.090
 as 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.720
 the city I have already arrived poorly welcomed 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.730
 well frank has made a very effort 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.290
 great for bringing me I have not done 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.480
 an effort last year yes this year 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.190
 not so much because I decided 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.970
 of the first days you want to come 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.440
 here so it's been easy not so fast 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.480
 how I liked it I wanted to come 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 the first day but good has been been 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.560
 easy the truth 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.810
 and try to make a good season to 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.700
 everything and then individually if it comes out 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 good season together 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.440
 I think the individual names then 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.750
 it will be better for everyone 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.820
 yes frank knows that my first choice 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.050
 it was here 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.379
 and the truth was very clear 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.460
 because they are decisions that I make and I think 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.800
 that here I can succeed I think here 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.039
 can we make a good year the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.039
 true 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.220
 to a club that already had the season 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.120
 after the first round he made 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.760
 I like his way of what I saw I liked it 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.370
 the way he played so I think that 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.160
 would fit very well in that way of 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.410
 play in the environment that is here and of 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 a decision that I have made and that I know 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.550
 perfectly what to do maybe 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.220
 of course of course I need the club 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.220
 you also need to stay at first 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.150
 division without suffering like last year 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.640
 Okay, yes 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.580
 No history of whether one goes down or up 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.420
 they but keep themselves by merit 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.790
 own and I need it I need it 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.510
 I need to have minutes and I think it's going 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.510
 to be very good year 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.820
 very well the truth to a person who 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.180
 close by what he could see 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.180
 the training approach 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.180
 spectacular 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.560
 different to what we have had something that 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.940
 we already wanted at the time 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.610
 and if he gives us that 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.500
 his tactical matrices of a guy with 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.450
 arrival with stride with deployment 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.020
 with the contribution of the user with 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.020
 physical presence 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.919
 and if already last year 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.110
 because it gives us that alternative to the rest 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.250
 of the pivots 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.420
 clear and to carry the truth well 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.520
 I think that 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.289
 now it will be a very nice match here in 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.190
 brno 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.690
 to see 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.690
 and that everything goes well that the fruit 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.460
 very well very very very rodent everything is not 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.819
 so big we already know the dimensions 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.949
 they have our fields but for a 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:51.069
 You're not going to look at the player either 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.889
 be watching the grandstand and the people 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.960
 note people notice when they scream and 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.220
 that's what's important for matches 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.920
 from home 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.510
 and that tomorrow is the meeting as you know 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.340
 of the Spanish federation in which 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.410
 traditionally the draw of the 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.260
 the calendar is a very week 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.249
 important for several reasons this is 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.779
 a fundamental one although there 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.149
 and we maintain the confidence that we have 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.729
 had until now and also because 

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:23.679
 within 75 years of history of 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.679
 this club we play the game 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.680
 the stellar moment throughout the year 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.170
 there are a series of acts that we have come 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.330
 developing for a long time and the 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.010
 match against celtic of glasgow that 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.500
 is a team that has been champion of 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.210
 europe good as you see this week is going to 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.560
 show the club the flag of is cooked 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.360
 beside 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.289
 on the right next to the club's flag 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.200
 little in homage 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:52.240
 has a maximum representation of 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.210
 from glasgow we want Saturday to be 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.210
 party with a lot of acts 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.210
 commemorative 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.560
 much excitement besides seeing among others 

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.810
 to the new footballers who are 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.000
 arriving 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:11.140
 it's a week in which they are giving 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.140
 there are many coincidences
