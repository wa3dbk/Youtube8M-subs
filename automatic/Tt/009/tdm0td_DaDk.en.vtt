00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.740
 the third fourth time he tries to shoot 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 this video but then I decided to shoot it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 without ladder because I wanted to do this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 dear blog open to talking about then 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 speaking all those who want 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.550
 listen to me without making me any problems 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 sorry if there are so many reasons 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.439
 I feel I have to do so what happened 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 yesterday wild lucarelli and francesco 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.690
 porters have sponsored the new one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.790
 francesco sole book 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 if we want to call it that, let's call it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.090
 so let's call it book is have 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 simply told of the bullshit 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.969
 apocalyptic because because with one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.309
 time they tried to get him through 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.820
 as a character not created a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.780
 coffee table a real real thing 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 which instead is not this is a project 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 fact is created to be born on youtube e 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 be successful because we are there 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.760
 become so excited because we are 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.770
 I managed to end up tweeting I think 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 call it on twitter 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 we are not envious of francesco 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860
 sun that in the secular April ducts but it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 we all know 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 we are simply opposed to this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.909
 youtube standardization to this 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 Mass TV's bullying entry 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.960
 media is contrary to the way it is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 they are carrying on 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.479
 I am against the fact that they take us 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 for the ass if you make the video that makes me 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.579
 crap i can comment on telling you 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 this video sucks because it is there 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.329
 this is because there may be because it is there 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 this is a revolution is the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.640
 youtube revolution is the only reason 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.729
 so the TV is different from youtube 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 because I can criticize a product but 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.930
 I can also appreciate writing this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.000
 I like this product for this reason 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.170
 and this is why putting me like it 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.900
 share it with all friends 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.350
 those that sponsor these projects 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.170
 they know it well and for this years head 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.300
 let francesco pass as much sun as he could 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.459
 be any other person they have 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.330
 interest in passing it as a 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.270
 spontaneous project because on youtube 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.810
 if I say that the project is a table 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.470
 functional less always any social media 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.150
 network on the web to be transparent 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.330
 first thing and we simply ask 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 this is a professional project of 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.450
 don't let it pass for a project 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.560
 amateur because it is not it is not if 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.769
 everyone notices 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.400
 in short, if the project is the project 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.430
 built to table 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.350
 tell us don't take the piss because 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.989
 this and take the piss out of us and 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 take it for a ride and public and this 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.150
 is a modus operandi of the TV that goes 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.180
 been going for twenty years for 40 years forever 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.049
 but on youtube it doesn't have to be this way 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.570
 the public must understand and must 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.060
 understand that we are going forward e 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.160
 now we need more audiences 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.790
 responsible who knows what's up 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.500
 watching who knows how to behave e 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.650
 how to use the tools that 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.510
 they were given because I 'm sure 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.970
 that if this marketing campaign 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.609
 had been made honestly in 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.040
 clearly in a transparent manner 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.220
 all these haters wouldn't be there 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.709
 there would certainly have been states 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.220
 because every public figure to gods 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.459
 template and let's call you and the tractors 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440
 with the Italian name detractors haters is 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.420
 a useless thing that I don't like for 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.829
 nothing the right word the detractors of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.970
 our project 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.799
 ok well of the detractors that are there 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.329
 always for any non-character 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.040
 they would have been much less 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.400
 I'm sure there is some 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.980
 person who used the state 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.840
 wild not twenty 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.340
 just because he wants to be 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.099
 on the other side of the camera 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.500
 he would like to be with wild lucarelli 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.659
 with francesco sole would like to be one 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.209
 some francesco sole I'm sure of 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.379
 this someone is there but most 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.410
 of the people they used 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.870
 that city ​​only exists 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.239
 respect and I am also convinced that i 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.760
 video of francesco sole as they are 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.280
 then the ideas mounted I don't know some 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.490
 they are obviously copied but oh well 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.100
 let alone the videos are done well 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.020
 It is obvious that a similar character if 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.400
 had done in the videos and cazzola had 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.050
 sponsored Franciscan si francesca 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.090
 francesco porters and savage 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.310
 lucarelli frank matano I also remember 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.050
 the buses would not have succeeded if 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.169
 he had made villas and dick not 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.820
 would have been successful obviously is not 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.250
 only for what he had 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.830
 success has also been successful for the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.020
 sponsorships for the recommendation 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.120
 who got behind this hashtag is 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.490
 born only from lack of respect 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.200
 towards content creators and the public 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.520
 because we are both clauses of 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.710
 content that the public 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.780
 we are all the same and if we don't learn to 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.389
 use the medium of youtube in a manner 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.700
 honest in a clear manner 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.800
 transparent and responsible 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.410
 these things will happen again not 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.720
 come there then to complain if between two three 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.599
 years you won't even be able to publish 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.400
 plus a spit on youtube without being 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.370
 dominated by these characters 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.800
 because if you don't complain now 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.039
 don't point out the problem now in 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.990
 this moment will be 34 years of francesco 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.910
 francesco project sun where there is 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.389
 they will be dozens 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.000
 if this audience does not make a wall and does not 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.910
 seeing this thing to us is not good 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.490
 we want real characters we want 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.220
 clear characters and if there are gods 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.830
 projects we want to know how they work 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.960
 they will come 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.290
 the others and there will be a warning 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.660
 total content and then everyone there 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.120
 cry because i like it don't work 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.070
 because the shares on facebook if 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.320
 don't pay they don't work and that's if there is 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.350
 of professionalism on youtube if there 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.320
 they are professional characters well 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.900
 come help the community grow 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.870
 more and more and to believe in this medium 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.390
 which at the moment is not very credible 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.640
 we are implicitly writing rule 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.370
 of the web and the rules of the web is strange that 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.030
 there must be for each project for 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.670
 every idea for everything on youtube 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.910
 honest and transparency will succeed 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.160
 same but at least will not have deceived the 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.310
 users who watch that product 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.250
 because if we do n't decide if we do n't put 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.050
 rules set now between 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.650
 some years we will meet again on youtube 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.910
 with the bartender with a film schedule the 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.680
 TV 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.680
 now the greeting bye
