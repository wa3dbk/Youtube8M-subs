to<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.000> most<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.049> pretty

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to make it most of them are pretty

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.770 
to make it most of them are pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.270> need<00:01:18.479> step

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
self-explanatory but if you do need step

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.499 
self-explanatory but if you do need step
by<00:01:18.810> step<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.240> side

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
by step the right here now on this side

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.969 
by step the right here now on this side
is<00:01:21.659> different<00:01:22.020> languages<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.650> don't<00:01:22.799> think

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
is different languages so don't think

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.010 
is different languages so don't think
that<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> takes<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.840> make

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that it takes you all that time to make

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.999
