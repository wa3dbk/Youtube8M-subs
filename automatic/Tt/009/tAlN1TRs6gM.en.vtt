00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
converted it goes straight in and it

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.069 
converted it goes straight in and it
starts<00:03:50.819> producing<00:03:51.000> they<00:03:51.510> know<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.870> you're

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
looking for so you got it's like a slow

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.509 
looking for so you got it's like a slow
delay<00:03:55.169> that's<00:03:55.500> why<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.680> got<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.829> take<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.069> 60<00:03:56.430> to

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
delay that's why you got to take a 60 to

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.949 
delay that's why you got to take a 60 to
90<00:03:56.760> minutes<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.180> one's<00:03:57.419> pretty<00:03:57.449> quick

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
90 minutes and this one's pretty quick

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.159 
90 minutes and this one's pretty quick
only<00:03:58.859> downside<00:03:59.430> on<00:03:59.459> this<00:03:59.940> one<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.269> me<00:04:00.449> is<00:04:00.480> they

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
only downside on this one to me is they

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.349 
only downside on this one to me is they
want<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.590> take<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.949> every<00:04:02.160> day<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.849> you

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
want you to take it every day it's you

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.750 
want you to take it every day it's you
know<00:04:03.449> one<00:04:03.660> capsule<00:04:04.079> per<00:04:04.139> day<00:04:04.290> with<00:04:04.709> food<00:04:04.949> so<00:04:05.609> if

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
know one capsule per day with food so if

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.220 
know one capsule per day with food so if
you<00:04:05.879> don't<00:04:06.030> want<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.870> don't<00:04:07.049> think

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
you don't want to do that I don't think

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.050 
you don't want to do that I don't think
you<00:04:07.440> should<00:04:07.470> but<00:04:08.370> you'll<00:04:08.669> probably<00:04:08.760> get<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
you should but you'll probably get a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.689 
you should but you'll probably get a
better<00:04:09.180> effect<00:04:09.599> if<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.900> do<00:04:10.079> take<00:04:10.379> it<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.280> as

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
better effect if you do take it on it as

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.629 
better effect if you do take it on it as
