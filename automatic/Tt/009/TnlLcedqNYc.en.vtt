00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello so here's how to achieve 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.000
 itself a rossoblu spreader so for 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.540
 start I'm going to use a pink base 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 I chose the brand maybelline a rose 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.400
 well flashy then i'm going to use a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.580
 blue glitter of the brand clean color 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 then little stickers in the shape of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 blue heart this so to start I 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.059
 am going to apply my rose base so 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.320
 this one is well covering so a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.320
 layer will suffice 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.670
 you wait about 30 seconds 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 to apply the blue 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.790
 so I chose to put my blue 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.130
 only on the tip of the nail as 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.130
 these as if I was performing a demo 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.250
 had a french manicure so this one 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.520
 is very light so I would apply 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.060
 two layers for the result to be 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.060
 intense 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.070
 I let it dry for a few moments 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 and I apply the second layer of blue 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.569
 always only on the end of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.200
 the nail I try to spread the best 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 small glitter 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.410
 here is the result of the second step 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 and to finish I will apply but 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.150
 little blue heart so for those I 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 take a little stick and I catch the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:47.190
 little chorus on the corner and I drop it 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.190
 on the top of the nail in the corner 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.890
 like this 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.460
 on the other nails in the other corner 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:34.530
 here is the result 1 and blue roses cards 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.530
 of colors that go very well together 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.549
 thank you
