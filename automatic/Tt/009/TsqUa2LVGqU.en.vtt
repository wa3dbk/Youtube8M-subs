00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so we'll make a nice little hole here on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
so we'll make a nice little hole here on
the<00:01:06.900> top<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.030> get

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the top of this one so that we can get

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.010 
the top of this one so that we can get
our<00:01:09.299> ladder<00:01:09.540> through<00:01:09.840> later<00:01:10.110> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.810 

we<00:01:17.020> want<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.320> cut<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:17.619> a<00:01:17.649> doorway<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.399> some

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
we want to cut in a doorway and some

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.359 
we want to cut in a doorway and some
windows<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:20.049> I'll<00:01:20.170> do<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.409> make<00:01:21.159> an

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
windows so what I'll do is make an

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.859 
windows so what I'll do is make an
incision<00:01:21.399> here<00:01:22.299> and<00:01:22.479> here<00:01:22.899> for<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.200> door<00:01:24.869> lift

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
incision here and here for a door lift

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:34.249 
incision here and here for a door lift
that<00:01:26.140> out<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.969> another<00:01:28.869> one<00:01:29.049> for<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.320> window

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.389 

and<00:01:35.259> now<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:35.470> don't<00:01:35.619> want<00:01:35.829> to<00:01:35.860> throw<00:01:36.039> these<00:01:36.159> away

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
and now I don't want to throw these away

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.950 
and now I don't want to throw these away
because<00:01:36.850> obviously<00:01:37.060> we're<00:01:37.479> going<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.659> have<00:01:37.810> to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
because obviously we're going to have to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.139 
because obviously we're going to have to
have<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.319> door<00:01:39.990> flatten<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.049> out<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:42.149> usually

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
have a door flatten it out and usually

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.620 
have a door flatten it out and usually
those<00:01:43.329> are<00:01:43.479> made<00:01:43.659> by<00:01:43.689> boards<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:44.619> we'll<00:01:44.860> put<00:01:45.100> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
those are made by boards so we'll put a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.809 
those are made by boards so we'll put a
line<00:01:46.630> down<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.110> center<00:01:47.349> another<00:01:48.159> line<00:01:48.520> down

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
line down the center another line down

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.889 
line down the center another line down
the<00:01:49.030> center<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:50.020> that'll<00:01:50.979> look<00:01:51.069> like<00:01:51.130> boards

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the center and that'll look like boards

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.240 
the center and that'll look like boards
maybe<00:01:52.899> give<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.259> little<00:01:53.289> indentation<00:01:53.709> at

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
maybe give it a little indentation at

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.529 
maybe give it a little indentation at
the<00:01:54.340> bottom<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:54.939> they<00:01:55.060> look<00:01:55.240> like<00:01:55.270> they're

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
the bottom so they look like they're

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.039 
the bottom so they look like they're
separated<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.950> creates<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.459> nice<00:01:57.610> door<00:01:58.049> let's

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
separated that creates a nice door let's

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.249 
separated that creates a nice door let's
do<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.289> same<00:01:59.500> thing<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.069> window

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
do the same thing with the window

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.059 
do the same thing with the window
flatten<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.349> out<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:05.259> we'll<00:02:05.560> make<00:02:05.679> it<00:02:05.739> like

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
flatten it out and we'll make it like

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.839 
flatten it out and we'll make it like
shutters<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.649> scribe<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.369> little<00:02:09.489> bit

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.449 

what<00:02:12.849> we<00:02:12.940> want<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.209> do<00:02:13.329> is<00:02:13.510> scribe<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:15.160> front

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
what we want to do is scribe the front

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.890 
what we want to do is scribe the front
of<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.610> building<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.239> that<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.510> looks<00:02:16.720> like

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
of the building so that it looks like

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.509 
of the building so that it looks like
the<00:02:17.049> Adobe<00:02:17.290> where<00:02:17.709> it's<00:02:17.829> all<00:02:17.950> stacked<00:02:18.310> on<00:02:18.489> top

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
the Adobe where it's all stacked on top

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.930 
the Adobe where it's all stacked on top
of<00:02:18.730> each<00:02:18.970> other<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:24.400> you've<00:02:24.519> ever<00:02:24.730> looked

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
of each other and if you've ever looked

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.599 
of each other and if you've ever looked
at<00:02:25.120> Adobe<00:02:25.569> houses<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.950> top<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.489> go

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
at Adobe houses on the top and they go

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.759 
at Adobe houses on the top and they go
to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> roof<00:02:28.269> we've<00:02:28.600> got<00:02:28.870> big<00:02:29.109> beams<00:02:29.470> going

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
to do the roof we've got big beams going

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.190 
to do the roof we've got big beams going
across<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:31.120> support<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.660> roof<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.019> we're

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
across to support the roof so we're

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.229 
across to support the roof so we're
going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.440> put<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.280> little<00:02:33.910> indentation

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
going to put in a little indentation

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.940 
going to put in a little indentation
where<00:02:35.049> we<00:02:35.170> want<00:02:35.380> those<00:02:35.560> beams<00:02:35.889> to<00:02:36.130> be<00:02:36.340> later<00:02:37.180> on

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.280 

now<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.010> last<00:02:42.250> thing<00:02:42.400> we<00:02:42.549> have<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.910> do<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.359> over

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
now the last thing we have to do is over

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.500 
now the last thing we have to do is over
the<00:02:44.410> threshold<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.220> over<00:02:45.459> each<00:02:45.579> window<00:02:46.060> we

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the threshold and over each window we

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.720 
the threshold and over each window we
have<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.780> supply<00:02:47.079> support<00:02:47.590> for<00:02:47.829> that<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.609> what

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
have to supply support for that so what

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.849 
have to supply support for that so what
you<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.239> find<00:02:49.600> yourself<00:02:49.780> some<00:02:50.200> twigs<00:02:50.500> you

want<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.459> get<00:02:51.579> them<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.880> slightly<00:02:51.970> longer

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
want to get them just slightly longer

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.840 
want to get them just slightly longer
than<00:02:53.200> what<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> window<00:02:53.859> in<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.220> doorway<00:02:54.609> is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
and embed it right above it and create

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.849 
and embed it right above it and create
your<00:03:00.150> support<00:03:01.150> for<00:03:01.299> your<00:03:01.450> window<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.680> can

we're going to do is take a little bit
of<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.350> project<00:04:36.830> loo<00:04:36.980> and<00:04:37.280> add<00:04:37.730> that<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.389> your

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
of the project loo and add that to your

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.830 
of the project loo and add that to your
wall<00:04:38.750> edge<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.970> just<00:04:40.970> push<00:04:41.150> these<00:04:41.360> two<00:04:41.630> pieces

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
wall edge and just push these two pieces

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.580 
wall edge and just push these two pieces
together<00:04:42.280> where<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.400> cement<00:04:43.730> is<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:45.020> then

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
together where the cement is and then

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.670 
together where the cement is and then
we're<00:04:45.710> ready<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.980> go<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.160> with<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.550> next<00:04:46.580> piece

building their first homes on Mesa tops

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.810 
building their first homes on Mesa tops
and<00:04:54.890> what<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.430> now<00:04:55.640> Mesa<00:04:56.060> Verde<00:04:56.630> Colorado

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.840 

starting<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.880> really<00:05:02.000> look<00:05:02.210> good<00:05:02.419> isn't<00:05:02.630> it

now<00:05:04.850> you're<00:05:05.030> ready<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.270> go<00:05:05.480> with<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.780> roofs<00:05:06.020> as

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
now you're ready to go with the roofs as

now you're ready to go with the roofs as
well<00:05:07.720> just<00:05:08.720> take<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> little<00:05:09.169> bit<00:05:09.350> more<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
well just take a little bit more of the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.909 
well just take a little bit more of the
project<00:05:11.120> glue<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.600> put<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.050> in<00:05:12.200> position<00:05:12.410> and

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
project glue and put it in position and

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:22.020 
project glue and put it in position and
we'll<00:05:15.919> go<00:05:16.040> on<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.460> next<00:05:16.669> one<00:05:16.910> over<00:05:17.600> here

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.580 

and<00:05:23.030> wipe<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.630> little<00:05:23.660> bit<00:05:23.990> along<00:05:24.229> this<00:05:24.380> edge

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
and wipe a little bit along this edge

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.870 
and wipe a little bit along this edge
because<00:05:24.770> that's<00:05:25.010> where<00:05:25.190> it's<00:05:25.280> going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.520> join

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
because that's where it's going to join

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.930 
because that's where it's going to join
with<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.660> other<00:05:26.690> roof<00:05:27.020> line<00:05:27.260> here

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.340

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
now that you've got them into position

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.150 
now that you've got them into position
or<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.130> got<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.430> do<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.639> let<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:37.970> dry<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.449> a<00:05:38.479> while

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
or I got to do is let it dry for a while

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.210 
or I got to do is let it dry for a while
okay<00:05:40.160> now<00:05:40.280> as<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:40.520> can<00:05:40.639> see<00:05:40.699> it's<00:05:41.060> dried<00:05:41.419> I<00:05:42.220> did

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
okay now as you can see it's dried I did

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.860 
okay now as you can see it's dried I did
add<00:05:43.400> a<00:05:43.430> few<00:05:43.699> little<00:05:43.820> pieces<00:05:44.120> on<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.509> back<00:05:44.660> to

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
add a few little pieces on the back to

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.290 
add a few little pieces on the back to
support<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.350> roof<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:46.430> remember<00:05:46.820> we<00:05:46.940> did<00:05:47.120> cut

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
support the roof and remember we did cut

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.879 
support the roof and remember we did cut
some<00:05:47.479> holes<00:05:47.630> in<00:05:47.900> here<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.350> people<00:05:48.740> could

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
some holes in here so that people could

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.439 
some holes in here so that people could
climb<00:05:49.100> out<00:05:49.280> and<00:05:49.430> get<00:05:49.580> up<00:05:49.669> on<00:05:49.820> their<00:05:49.970> roof<00:05:50.180> now

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
climb out and get up on their roof now

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.210 
climb out and get up on their roof now
in<00:05:50.780> order<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.110> do<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.650> course<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.070> would

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
in order to do that of course you would

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.640 
in order to do that of course you would
need<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.430> ladder<00:05:52.699> so<00:05:53.229> taking<00:05:54.229> some<00:05:54.440> of<00:05:54.470> your

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
need a ladder so taking some of your

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.980 
need a ladder so taking some of your
sticks<00:05:54.949> like<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.280> did<00:05:55.460> earlier<00:05:55.580> just<00:05:56.120> cement

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
sticks like you did earlier just cement

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.990 
sticks like you did earlier just cement
a<00:05:57.080> few<00:05:57.259> pieces<00:05:57.440> together<00:05:57.800> crudely<00:05:58.370> like<00:05:58.699> this

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
a few pieces together crudely like this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.760 
a few pieces together crudely like this
so<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.389> it<00:05:59.509> forms<00:05:59.750> a<00:05:59.930> ladder<00:06:00.139> and<00:06:00.470> you<00:06:00.530> can

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
so that it forms a ladder and you can

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.480 
so that it forms a ladder and you can
put<00:06:00.979> your<00:06:01.190> ladder<00:06:01.400> in<00:06:02.199> to<00:06:03.199> your<00:06:03.289> roof<00:06:03.530> so<00:06:04.340> that

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
put your ladder in to your roof so that

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.550 
put your ladder in to your roof so that
the<00:06:04.610> people<00:06:04.789> can<00:06:05.120> get<00:06:05.270> out<00:06:05.419> what<00:06:06.259> about<00:06:06.440> if<00:06:06.530> you

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
the people can get out what about if you

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.460 
the people can get out what about if you
did<00:06:06.770> multiple<00:06:07.250> layers<00:06:07.940> on<00:06:08.240> it<00:06:08.389> just<00:06:09.080> happen<00:06:09.380> to

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
did multiple layers on it just happen to

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.080 
did multiple layers on it just happen to
have<00:06:09.590> another<00:06:09.620> section<00:06:10.160> that<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.490> did<00:06:10.789> and<00:06:10.970> that

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
have another section that I did and that

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.110 
have another section that I did and that
could<00:06:11.270> go<00:06:11.389> up<00:06:11.419> on<00:06:11.750> top<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.530> of<00:06:13.520> course<00:06:13.789> you<00:06:13.970> got

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
could go up on top and of course you got

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.850 
could go up on top and of course you got
to<00:06:14.240> get<00:06:14.330> out<00:06:14.360> of<00:06:14.479> that<00:06:14.720> roof<00:06:15.020> so<00:06:15.289> you<00:06:15.590> make<00:06:15.830> a

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
to get out of that roof so you make a

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.760 
to get out of that roof so you make a
little<00:06:16.099> little<00:06:16.610> bit<00:06:16.699> longer<00:06:17.000> ladder<00:06:17.570> and<00:06:17.870> now

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
little little bit longer ladder and now

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.040 
little little bit longer ladder and now
they<00:06:18.979> have<00:06:19.250> a<00:06:19.550> way<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:20.240> get<00:06:20.419> out<00:06:20.539> of<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.810> one

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
they have a way to get out of that one

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.529 
they have a way to get out of that one
so<00:06:21.639> there's<00:06:22.639> no<00:06:22.759> end<00:06:22.940> of<00:06:23.060> what<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:23.300> can<00:06:23.419> do

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
so there's no end of what you can do

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:30.210 
so there's no end of what you can do
here<00:06:23.780> so<00:06:23.960> let's<00:06:24.139> cement<00:06:24.470> that<00:06:24.620> piece<00:06:24.860> in<00:06:25.070> place

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.310 

let<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:31.370> dry<00:06:31.729> and<00:06:32.539> then<00:06:32.660> we<00:06:32.750> can<00:06:32.900> come<00:06:33.110> back

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
let that dry and then we can come back

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.770 
let that dry and then we can come back
and<00:06:33.380> paint<00:06:34.160> the<00:06:34.340> whole<00:06:34.370> thing<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:35.479> that<00:06:35.659> it

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
and paint the whole thing so that it

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.760 
and paint the whole thing so that it
looks<00:06:35.960> more<00:06:36.169> realistic

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
looks more realistic

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.920 
looks more realistic
okay<00:06:37.159> now<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.460> it's<00:06:37.699> dry<00:06:37.880> we're<00:06:38.599> ready<00:06:38.780> to

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
okay now that it's dry we're ready to

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.290 
okay now that it's dry we're ready to
paint<00:06:39.169> we've<00:06:40.070> got<00:06:40.280> our<00:06:40.400> paints<00:06:40.729> that<00:06:40.789> came<00:06:41.090> in

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
paint we've got our paints that came in

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.860 
paint we've got our paints that came in
the<00:06:41.449> sculpting<00:06:42.110> kit<00:06:42.349> and<00:06:43.300> I'm<00:06:44.300> going<00:06:44.539> to<00:06:44.630> take

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
the sculpting kit and I'm going to take

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.520 
the sculpting kit and I'm going to take
the<00:06:45.490> light<00:06:46.490> tan<00:06:46.880> and<00:06:47.240> paint<00:06:47.510> that<00:06:47.720> all<00:06:48.020> over

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
the light tan and paint that all over

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.000 
the light tan and paint that all over
all<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.159> earth<00:06:49.639> earth<00:06:50.000> portions<00:06:53.620> now<00:06:54.620> I<00:06:54.680> took

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
all the earth earth portions now I took

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.399 
all the earth earth portions now I took
the<00:06:55.099> paint<00:06:55.370> ahead<00:06:56.180> of<00:06:56.300> time<00:06:56.539> and<00:06:56.780> dilute<00:06:57.260> it

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
the paint ahead of time and dilute it

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.279 
the paint ahead of time and dilute it
down<00:06:57.740> to<00:06:58.099> where<00:06:58.250> it's<00:06:58.400> about<00:06:58.610> a<00:06:58.669> 50%<00:06:59.289> mixture

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
down to where it's about a 50% mixture

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.020 
down to where it's about a 50% mixture
so<00:07:00.500> it's<00:07:00.650> more<00:07:00.830> like<00:07:01.009> a<00:07:01.039> stain<00:07:01.430> rather<00:07:01.759> than<00:07:02.000> a

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
so it's more like a stain rather than a

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.450 
so it's more like a stain rather than a
paint<00:07:02.389> that<00:07:03.289> way<00:07:03.530> it'll<00:07:03.770> get<00:07:03.919> into<00:07:04.190> all<00:07:04.310> the

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
paint that way it'll get into all the

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.760 
paint that way it'll get into all the
little<00:07:04.490> cracks<00:07:04.940> and<00:07:05.150> crevices<00:07:05.680> giving<00:07:06.680> it

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
little cracks and crevices giving it

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.790 
little cracks and crevices giving it
more<00:07:06.979> depth<00:07:07.280> coming<00:07:07.580> through<00:07:07.880> it<00:07:08.680> next<00:07:09.680> thing

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
more depth coming through it next thing

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.379 
more depth coming through it next thing
we<00:07:09.860> want<00:07:10.039> to<00:07:10.099> do<00:07:10.250> is<00:07:10.400> rinse<00:07:10.580> our<00:07:10.729> brush<00:07:10.940> out<00:07:11.180> and

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
the graining and separating the board so

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.839 
the graining and separating the board so
that<00:07:39.080> you<00:07:39.259> can<00:07:39.379> really<00:07:39.560> see<00:07:39.889> them<00:07:40.009> I<00:07:40.219> mean<00:07:40.759> it

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849 
that you can really see them I mean it

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.459 
that you can really see them I mean it
just<00:07:40.969> brings<00:07:41.330> out<00:07:41.509> all<00:07:41.719> the<00:07:41.870> texture<00:07:42.349> and

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:42.469 
just brings out all the texture and

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.339 
just brings out all the texture and
really<00:07:42.650> makes<00:07:42.830> it<00:07:42.949> look<00:07:43.009> like<00:07:43.129> Goodwood

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349 
really makes it look like Goodwood

happen<00:07:47.810> to<00:07:47.840> have<00:07:47.930> a<00:07:48.020> diorama<00:07:48.469> here<00:07:48.770> that<00:07:48.919> this

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 
happen to have a diorama here that this

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.070 
happen to have a diorama here that this
would<00:07:49.219> probably<00:07:49.370> fit<00:07:49.699> into<00:07:49.909> pretty<00:07:50.120> good<00:07:50.389> so

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
would probably fit into pretty good so

let's take a look and we'll slide it

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.429 
let's take a look and we'll slide it
into<00:07:54.409> place<00:07:54.650> a<00:07:54.770> little<00:07:55.099> bit<00:07:55.280> here<00:07:56.289> well<00:07:57.289> let's

00:07:57.429 --> 00:07:57.439 
into place a little bit here well let's

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.610 
into place a little bit here well let's
not<00:07:57.500> forget<00:07:57.620> our<00:07:57.979> ladders<00:07:58.759> what<00:07:59.659> learn<00:08:00.319> how<00:08:00.560> to
