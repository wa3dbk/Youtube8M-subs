to<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.360> front<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.750> spider<00:01:53.080> we're<00:01:53.740> going

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
to the front of the spider we're going

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.850 
to the front of the spider we're going
to<00:01:54.360> try<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.420> find<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.810> injector<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.500> here<00:01:56.740> it's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
to try to find the injector up here it's

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.040 
to try to find the injector up here it's
actually<00:01:57.340> very<00:01:57.369> difficult<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.000> see<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.899> we'll

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
actually very difficult to see so we'll

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.990 
actually very difficult to see so we'll
have<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.259> camera<00:01:59.590> zoom<00:01:59.800> on<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.520> we're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
have the camera zoom on in and we're

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760 
have the camera zoom on in and we're
going<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.149> look<00:02:01.300> for<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:01.690> in<00:02:02.350> between<00:02:02.649> these

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
going to look for this in between these

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.600 
going to look for this in between these
wires

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
wires

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.820 
wires
there's<00:02:05.210> going<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.450> be<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.780> injector<00:02:06.710> harness

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
there's going to be a injector harness

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.350 
there's going to be a injector harness
it<00:02:07.100> has<00:02:07.190> some<00:02:07.340> green<00:02:07.610> tape<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.180> right<00:02:08.479> there

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it has some green tape on it right there

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.230 
it has some green tape on it right there
okay<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:15.170> we're<00:02:15.320> going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.470> use<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:16.240> long

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
okay now we're going to use a long

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.840 
okay now we're going to use a long
screwdriver<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:18.500> reach<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.220> press

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the wire clip so that disconnects the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.990 
the wire clip so that disconnects the
connector<00:02:24.290> image<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.070> can-am<00:02:25.520> spyder<00:02:25.880> is

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
connector image on the can-am spyder is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
we're going to reach in here and see if

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.050 
we're going to reach in here and see if
we<00:02:33.950> can<00:02:34.100> locate<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.670> get<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:34.940> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
we can locate it and get it to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.300 
we can locate it and get it to
disconnect<00:02:35.620> I've<00:02:36.620> got<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.040> I'm<00:02:37.130> going<00:02:37.280> to

this around in this direction and right

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.390 
this around in this direction and right
up<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.110> here<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.920> connector<00:03:28.280> we're

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
up in here is the connector we're

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.680 
up in here is the connector we're
looking<00:03:28.640> for<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.269> same<00:03:29.420> as<00:03:29.600> this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
looking for and it's the same as this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.940 
looking for and it's the same as this
one<00:03:29.840> as<00:03:29.989> well<00:03:30.080> just<00:03:30.290> like<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.590> other<00:03:30.709> side

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
one as well just like on the other side

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.530 
one as well just like on the other side
so<00:03:31.519> there's<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.730> wire<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.120> you're<00:03:32.360> going<00:03:32.480> to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
so there's a wire that you're going to
