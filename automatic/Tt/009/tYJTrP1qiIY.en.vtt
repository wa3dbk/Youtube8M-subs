gimbal that we're able to bring to you I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
gimbal that we're able to bring to you I
went<00:00:17.610> ahead<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.480> box<00:00:18.690> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
went ahead and got it out of the box and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.450 
went ahead and got it out of the box and
let<00:00:19.020> me<00:00:19.110> hold<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.530> and<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:20.070> over<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
let me hold it up and go over the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.090 
let me hold it up and go over the
skimble<00:00:20.790> with<00:00:20.940> you<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> base<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
skimble with you so it's a base for a

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.730 
skimble with you so it's a base for a
GoPro<00:00:23.760> 3<00:00:24.030> style<00:00:24.480> action<00:00:25.020> cam<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.500> definitely

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
GoPro 3 style action cam it's definitely

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040 
GoPro 3 style action cam it's definitely
engineered<00:00:26.670> specifically<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> GoPro

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
engineered specifically for the GoPro

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.510 
engineered specifically for the GoPro
but<00:00:28.200> there<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.620> other<00:00:28.770> action<00:00:29.130> cams<00:00:29.310> are

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
but there are some other action cams are

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.250 
but there are some other action cams are
on<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.700> same<00:00:29.910> form<00:00:30.180> factor<00:00:30.360> they'll<00:00:31.050> work

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on the same form factor they'll work

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170 
on the same form factor they'll work
with<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> gimbal<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> standard<00:00:32.730> Kimbo

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
with this gimbal so a standard Kimbo

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
with this gimbal so a standard Kimbo
gives<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.570> basically<00:00:34.199> a<00:00:34.350> pitch<00:00:34.859> and<00:00:35.160> roll

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
gives you basically a pitch and roll

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.239 
gives you basically a pitch and roll
with<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.269> and<00:00:36.929> your<00:00:37.499> yaw<00:00:37.649> has<00:00:37.890> always<00:00:38.039> been

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
with it and your yaw has always been

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.840 
with it and your yaw has always been
left<00:00:38.519> up<00:00:38.699> to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.999> multi<00:00:39.300> rotor<00:00:39.449> itself<00:00:39.719> now

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
left up to the multi rotor itself now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
left up to the multi rotor itself now
some<00:00:41.850> people<00:00:42.149> depending<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.780> smooth<00:00:43.079> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
some people depending on how smooth they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
some people depending on how smooth they
are<00:00:43.289> on<00:00:43.559> their<00:00:43.679> stick<00:00:43.949> see<00:00:44.159> get<00:00:44.429> a<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.699> bit

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
are on their stick see get a little bit

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
are on their stick see get a little bit
of<00:00:44.909> a<00:00:44.999> robot<00:00:45.449> move<00:00:45.719> you're<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.289> smooth

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
of a robot move you're nice and smooth

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.919 
of a robot move you're nice and smooth
this<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.399> flying<00:00:47.730> around<00:00:47.999> but<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.659> yaw

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
this way flying around but when you yaw

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.079 
this way flying around but when you yaw
is<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.379> locked<00:00:50.069> in<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.789> stops

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
is very locked in and it just stops

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.869 
is very locked in and it just stops
unless<00:00:51.390> you're<00:00:51.569> really<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.319> sticks

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
unless you're really good on the sticks

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
unless you're really good on the sticks
thus<00:00:53.879> comes<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> three<00:00:54.600> axis<00:00:54.960> gimbal<00:00:55.140> now

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
thus comes the three axis gimbal now

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.910 
thus comes the three axis gimbal now
this<00:00:56.550> 3<00:00:56.760> axis<00:00:57.089> gimbal<00:00:57.300> comes<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.319> an<00:00:58.499> Alexa

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this 3 axis gimbal comes with an Alexa

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.369 
this 3 axis gimbal comes with an Alexa
mousse<00:00:59.069> or<00:00:59.339> base<00:00:59.699> camp<00:01:00.059> controller<00:01:00.839> on<00:01:01.019> it<00:01:01.050> so

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
mousse or base camp controller on it so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
mousse or base camp controller on it so
it<00:01:01.530> allows<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> plug<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.639> change<00:01:02.969> a

it allows you to plug in and change a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.380 
it allows you to plug in and change a
range<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.110> settings<00:01:04.549> for<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.759> three<00:01:06.030> axis

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
range of settings for your three axis

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
range of settings for your three axis
set<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.869> couple<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.350> different<00:01:07.680> modes<00:01:08.430> where

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
set up a couple of different modes where

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.249 
set up a couple of different modes where
it's<00:01:08.969> either<00:01:09.119> locked<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> forward

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
it's either locked in in the forward

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.959 
it's either locked in in the forward
position<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.710> regardless<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.399> your<00:01:11.460> yacht<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
position and regardless of your yacht it

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.899 
position and regardless of your yacht it
will<00:01:12.060> stay<00:01:12.270> forward<00:01:12.890> for<00:01:13.890> multirotors<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
will stay forward for multirotors the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.149 
will stay forward for multirotors the
the<00:01:15.240> best<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.079> following<00:01:16.710> mode<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the best is the following mode and you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.069 
the best is the following mode and you
can<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> tolerance<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
can set up the tolerance on that and

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.160 
can set up the tolerance on that and
what<00:01:19.289> happens<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:21.210> multi<00:01:21.600> rotor<00:01:21.810> yaws

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
what happens is as your multi rotor yaws

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.850 
what happens is as your multi rotor yaws
this<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.219> allow<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.149> certain<00:01:24.360> degree<00:01:24.860> which

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
this will allow a certain degree which

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.529 
this will allow a certain degree which
is<00:01:25.890> Centreville<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.360> start

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
is Centreville and then this will start

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.510 
is Centreville and then this will start
pitch<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> following<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.219> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
pitch and following it so it's kind of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.480 
pitch and following it so it's kind of
like<00:01:29.780> delay<00:01:30.780> behind<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> smooths<00:01:32.280> out

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
like delay behind it but it smooths out

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.459 
like delay behind it but it smooths out
that<00:01:32.700> motion<00:01:32.969> so<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:33.810> nice<00:01:34.079> fluid

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
that motion so you get that nice fluid

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.249 
that motion so you get that nice fluid
yaw<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> down<00:01:36.060> motion<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:37.049> course

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
yaw and up and down motion and of course

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
yaw and up and down motion and of course
it<00:01:37.409> has<00:01:37.530> inputs<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.180> for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it has inputs on the on the the back for

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.080 
it has inputs on the on the the back for
yaw<00:01:39.689> pitch<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.740> roll<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.789> able<00:01:41.939> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
yaw pitch and roll so you're able to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
yaw pitch and roll so you're able to
control<00:01:42.450> those<00:01:42.600> manually<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.229> well<00:01:43.259> what's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
control those manually as well what's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
control those manually as well what's
really<00:01:44.189> nice<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.670> style<00:01:44.969> gimbals<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
really nice with these style gimbals is

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.330 
really nice with these style gimbals is
you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.020> almost<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.649> person<00:01:46.859> flying

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you can almost have one person flying

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
you can almost have one person flying
the<00:01:47.520> multi<00:01:47.820> rotor<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.299> another<00:01:48.600> person<00:01:48.960> with

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the multi rotor and another person with

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.959 
the multi rotor and another person with
the<00:01:49.170> transmitter<00:01:49.619> plugged<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.250> flying

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
the transmitter plugged into this flying

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.639 
the transmitter plugged into this flying
the<00:01:51.149> camera<00:01:51.539> and<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.719> can<00:01:51.899> y'all<00:01:52.140> around<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the camera and they can y'all around and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
the camera and they can y'all around and
take<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.729> scene<00:01:53.969> so<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.539> can

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
take a look at the the scene so you can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.419 
take a look at the the scene so you can
actually<00:01:55.259> focus<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:55.920> different<00:01:56.070> things

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
actually focus on two different things

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.029 
actually focus on two different things
anyway<00:01:57.149> guys<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> 3<00:01:58.079> axis<00:01:58.409> gimbal<00:01:58.439> has

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
anyway guys this is a 3 axis gimbal has

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.190 
anyway guys this is a 3 axis gimbal has
the<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.640> base<00:01:59.820> game<00:02:00.030> electronics<00:02:00.719> mini

there so you're going to want to fly
this<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> little<00:02:20.680> bit<00:02:20.770> larger<00:02:21.310> quad<00:02:21.550> maybe

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
this on a little bit larger quad maybe

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.670

give<00:02:22.150> 450<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.750> probably<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.140> able<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.380> pick<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
give 450 you probably be able to pick it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.020 
give 450 you probably be able to pick it
up<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> be<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> little<00:02:24.580> heavy<00:02:24.820> a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
up but it's going to be a little heavy a
