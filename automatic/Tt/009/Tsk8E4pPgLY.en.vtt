the withering and damage that we haven't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.280 
the withering and damage that we haven't
restored<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.720> gives<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> good

Canada little test patch that we've done
using<00:01:40.860> our<00:01:41.159> restoration<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.150> anti<00:01:42.390> polish

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
using our restoration and an anti polish

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.249 
using our restoration and an anti polish
we<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.979> these<00:01:44.360> quite<00:01:45.360> successfully<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we can do these quite successfully and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
we can do these quite successfully and
the<00:01:46.649> nano<00:01:46.829> polish<00:01:47.220> gives<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.810> long-term

the nano polish gives you long-term

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
the nano polish gives you long-term
protection<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.579> the
