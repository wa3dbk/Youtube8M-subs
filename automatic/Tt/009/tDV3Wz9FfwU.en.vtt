00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
the Earth revolves around the Sun but on

days of July we reach our furthest point
from<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:30.800> Sun<00:00:31.039> so<00:00:31.880> why<00:00:32.089> is<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.269> so<00:00:32.540> hot<00:00:32.750> in<00:00:33.080> fact

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530
