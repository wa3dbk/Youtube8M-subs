00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.670
 lentine squid is a fungus that 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.099
 absorbs dead wood from nutrients 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.259
 necessary for its development 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.390
 and this can occur in trees of 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.109
 different species and in different 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.150
 weather conditions in brazil 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.850
 a good alternative found by 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.160
 producers was the use of eucalyptus by 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.170
 be a way to affordable and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.589
 easy to find in almost every 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.210
 regions of the country 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.549
 we remember that there are several species of 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.949
 eucalyptus, some of which are 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.250
 shiitake farming what you need 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.440
 to know then is how to choose this wood 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.350
 after all, this is the most expensive 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.839
 shiitake production will prefer 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.720
 trees with a more solid texture but not 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.390
 renews that have developed in soils 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.229
 firm and rich in nutrients 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.260
 educated 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.990
 the most densely populated trees 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.270
 are the most indicated because they have the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.290
 trunk with few jobs or 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.540
 we aromatic species such as eucalyptus 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 citriodora time should be avoided because 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.520
 changes the flavor of Congo - the best 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.470
 season for cutting the trees will be 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.900
 one in which the stories by their greater 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.270
 possible amount of carbohydrates and 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.480
 organic acids and the bark does not 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.520
 trees should be easily 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.770
 first cut sprout things 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.940
 generally present more certain what they 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.760
 not desired 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.070
 during the cut we will take care to 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.350
 trunk does not peel and the bark does not 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.300
 avoiding damage if the input 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.120
 contaminants 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.110
 internally the wood subdivides itself into 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.370
 very characteristic regions such as bark 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.790
 the exchange 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.700
 the wood and finally the most 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.130
 call center right 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.200
 the bark is a physical barrier to entry 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.050
 contaminants and it is in this 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
 concentrate more than 50% of the nutrients 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.740
 wood 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.260
 prefer the logs that have the bark 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.000
 thick they resisted better to the 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.760
 variations in relative humidity 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.240
 environment and handling that can lead to 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.630
 mismatch between logs of the same 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.340
 diameter we will choose the heaviest 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.680
 provided the cern is not very 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.890
 developed like this wood 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.820
 it is recommended that it be less than 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.130
 30% of the diameter of the torah the size 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.890
 of traditional logs varies from 80 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.530
 inches to one meter and twenty more 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.780
 some producers are already farming in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.390
 from two meters to two meters and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.489
 twenty in function of even the cut 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.489
 standard for body transport
