00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.289
 hello are welcome to is that is factor 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.180
 comic today I bring you the review of batman 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:09.010
 year one this comic has extracted us 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.500
 by television editorial with a cost of 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.520
 99 pesos in the best format 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.620
 of sep 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.779
 this this format that is one of the most 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.699
 easy to operate the TV by 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.710
 part of your unit that but it is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.839
 pretty good and quite economical 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.150
 besides that its content is worth it 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.630
 this this would be the best of that number 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.060
 6 this one came out number 5 in the month of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.950
 December 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.879
 pretty good the titles that we have 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.710
 brought by part of the best of that to 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.840
 exception of the last one that was number 5 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.030
 that brought us double family that the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.440
 it's true that it was one of the worst comics 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.059
 by batman and still not what 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.350
 they brought more than anything for marketing but 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.180
 well anyway that's another subject 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.739
 they have had enough stories for us 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.390
 see you in bat I would like us to 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.699
 They bring other kinds of stories but good 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.289
 in order that you can do this 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.030
 have brought the first one that fault 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.289
 came out just a year ago also in 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.719
 February that was the dark knight ford 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.840
 taunus then last month's 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.970
 December forgiveness in the month of December 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.060
 that brought us from the family and now 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.680
 they bring us batman year one the truth I do not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.140
 I complain because they are stories 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.789
 classic that any batman fan will 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.350
 I would like to have but then also 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.050
 like to have other types of stories 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.270
 this comic written by frank miller and 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.979
 the strokes are by david mazuchelli or 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 more you do not know how to pronounce it very 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.650
 all right 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's not the formats or it's not the comic 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.440
 fattest he has had on the part of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.970
 best of bs 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.670
 I would say that together with this one and the one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.320
 double family are the thinnest but 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 good makes up for it with its large amount 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 of extras this already in its moment what 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 published lives so if you have the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 weak this one would only suit you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.220
 your extras if you're a fan of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.930
 bat you will have to have it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
 in your collection but if you're not that fan 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.049
 and you were just interested in the story not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.060
 have something else that can offer you more 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 than the extras and well if you are not interested 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.470
 so much does not have much case that what 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.640
 buy obviously if you already have it if you do not 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 you have it if you are a fan of the bat 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.670
 Well, it's really a good one 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.259
 opportunity if you do not like the bat 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 also give it a try because it's 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.009
 one of his classic stories is a 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.200
 reinterpretation of the origin then 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.900
 well worth this comic 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.780
 is it if inspired good extracted to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 us of the deluxe format that is 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.300
 already manages in the USA for this type of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.190
 stories 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.959
 obviously there is in the USA it is handled with a 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.090
 best quality with hardcover and with a 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.290
 covers dust but obviously then 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.420
 here already televisa is not going to reach 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.459
 for so much for so much and if it does not bring it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.780
 It would be a very expensive price and also 99 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.000
 pesos is a very affordable price 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.090
 for all content 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.550
 the truth is well worth it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.710
 they contain the four numbers that 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.140
 they left in their moment more 40 pages of 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.000
 pure extras is pretty good the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.430
 History tells us about the origin of 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
 the bat not so bruce wayne to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.020
 his inspiration but tells us the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.970
 origin of batman this along with the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.460
 origin of james gordon and his arrival at the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.740
 Gothic city too 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.570
 sometimes they show us various characters 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.760
 that in the future will be important 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.650
 within the title show us in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.410
 parallel the history of Gordon along with 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.360
 the story of bruce wayne how it goes 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.010
 searching 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.300
 um 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.420
 a kind of 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.680
 from something that can help you do 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.570
 that they fear it because they already have 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.760
 technique and methods but still you 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.190
 missing that something I do so that the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.250
 theme villains and to recognize 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.110
 who is the east also on the part of 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.840
 james gordon does not show it like never 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.340
 they had not shown him as a father of 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.330
 family that is about to bring a 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.030
 baby to one of the most 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.380
 dangerous in the world and try to clean 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 this city although obviously it's not going to 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.120
 be simple and on the part of different 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.530
 characters because it shows us what it is 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.070
 what they are doing at the point where 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.480
 batman was born is pretty good 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.650
 in the first numbers are concentrated 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.260
 more in the history of Gordon than of 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.780
 batman but then already advancing the comic 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.810
 they go 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.540
 this is interlacing the stories 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.100
 pretty good I liked it here has one 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 of the most impressive dialogues that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970
 have come out in the good comics of the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.290
 more memorable dialogues I'll leave it 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.910
 for you to read it and when 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.610
 read, I suppose they realize 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.320
 what is this is the true origin and 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.269
 only batman is not scaled that 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.609
 they are taking away with zero years that in 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.169
 true is a good comic a short comic 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.850
 that shows you what you have to 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.440
 show teaches you what is necessary to 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.510
 understand the story and it does not challenge you every 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.610
 unnecessary stories just to show 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.530
 the origin of batman this is a good 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.030
 origin this is a good story and for 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.700
 part of the drawing that can be said is 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.060
 I love it, it's pretty 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.419
 simple without so many strokes in dark 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.010
 but it looks very good to the series is 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.780
 a story that is very much worth it if 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.250
 you're a bat fan or do not be a fan of 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.840
 the bat may you like it because 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.340
 these are from your classic stories that 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.470
 was what formed the bat as it is 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.210
 today then it is very worthwhile that 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.680
 read it and as I say, it brings the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.650
 extras that are pretty enough 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.479
 good are 40 pages of extra cigars 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.650
 contains the epilogue by the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.810
 Cartoonist of the artist 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.270
 david mazuchelli and contains a 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.039
 introduction by o'neil denny 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.330
 quite interesting then well 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.430
 very much worth it if you're a fan of 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.229
 bat and you do not have this story or 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.639
 if you have it but you want to get everything 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.380
 I will give you this great number of extras 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.229
 a little taste for more or less to see 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.020
 what is it that contains betrayals 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.520
 the first strokes is very very well 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.789
 made this edition as I say it is 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.410
 based on the deluxe edition of usa that 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.330
 Well, as I say , it's much better 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.729
 hard paste quality and with covers by 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.240
 you but good in order for example here 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.599
 are the scripts that I told them 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.130
 very good edition here the strokes the 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.800
 sketches could rather get to 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.180
 say very very good comic and well then 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.259
 this is all for my part I hope that you 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.729
 I liked it, I hope you have served 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.680
 that has convinced you is not going to buy 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.270
 this comic leaves in the comments if you 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.580
 and what you read if you have not read or 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.050
 you want to buy it I recommend that you 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.430
 buy it is worth it more than 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.199
 nothing for the extras if you do not have 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.060
 the story is also worth a lot 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.919
 it's really a great comic that the 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.509
 I really enjoyed it a lot is a comic 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.729
 fairly simple to read is not heavy 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.710
 I just read it today and I bought it today 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.990
 same then then it's nothing heavy and 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.819
 because the truth is worth quite quite the 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.970
 pity that's all on my part until 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.970
 then
