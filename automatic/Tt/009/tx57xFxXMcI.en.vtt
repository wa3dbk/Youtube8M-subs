00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.930
 "The Heart of Heart: Turmeric and Sports" 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.370
 Endothelial cells constitute the inner structure of our blood vessels 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.650
 Connect a person's endothelial cells end to end 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.840
 Its length can be more than four times around the earth 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
 And it is not an inert layer because it has high metabolic activity 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.100
 I have already mentioned our endothelial cells. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.250
 How sensitive is it to oxidation and inflammation 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.980
 If we don't care for it, endothelial dysfunction may be 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 Cause heart attack or stroke 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.600
 Are we ready to be alert to the early warning signs of the endothelium? 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.010
 If it is all about oxidation and inflammation 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 Then fruits and vegetables should help, and it is true. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.660
 Every fruit or vegetable every day 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.989
 Both are associated with an improvement in endothelial function of 6%. 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.170
 Current research on improving endothelial function related to fruits and vegetables 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.399
 And several conclusions are that vitamin C tablets are not beneficial to endothelial function 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.530
 Formed a sharp contrast 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.490
 The conclusion that can be drawn is the effect of fruits and vegetables in the study. 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.340
 Should be produced not only by the action of any nutrients in fruits and vegetables 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
 Instead of looking for a magical micronutrient 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 A more practical approach would be to consider the food itself. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.049
 Therefore, under the synergistic effect of all excellent substances in plants 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200
 Increase the intake of fruits and vegetables 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.049
 Very likely to have a lot of beneficial effects 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.520
 Exercise is also helpful, but what type of exercise is most helpful? 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.659
 Patients were randomly assigned to four groups: 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.579
 Aerobics (one hour a day by bike), 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.740
 Resistance training (using load and elastic bands), all or none 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.939
 Both the aerobic group and the resistance group showed an effect 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.340
 Of course, compared to the group of people who are sitting alone 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.329
 The group that is both aerobic and anaerobic is of course very good. 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.149
 But please note that as long as you do have physical exercise 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.640
 And it’s done regularly, then your endothelial cells 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.650
 I don’t care if you are going to ride a bike or go to the iron. 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.349
 But if you stop exercising, your endothelial function will drop. 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.849
 Antioxidant tablets will not work, what about anti-inflammatory tablets? 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.579
 Pharmaceutical companies will not give up easily. 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.250
 After all, the food that can be served in the place where the salad is sold is just a little bit 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.860
 For those who prefer to eat more than taking medicine 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.980
 One of the most anti-inflammatory foods is spice turmeric 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.019
 Japanese researchers recently compared exercise and curcumin 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.129
 That is, the yellow pigment in turmeric and curry powder has an effect on endothelial function. 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.189
 Eat about one teaspoon of turmeric a day for eight weeks. 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.629
 Compared with aerobic exercise 30 to 60 minutes a day 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.969
 Which group can improve endothelial function? 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.310
 No significant physical changes were observed in either group 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.310
 But the sports group saw a significant increase in their endothelial function. 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.400
 The same is true for the curcumin group 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.269
 The degree of improvement in curcumin treatment 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.989
 Almost as much as obtained through exercise 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.379
 Therefore, regular intake of curcumin 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.709
 May be for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.109
 a preventive measure 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.959
 In addition, their results also indicate that curcumin may be 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.329
 Potential alternative therapy for patients who are unable to exercise 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.109
 But ideally, we should use both methods. 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.010
 In this study, they studied central arterial hemodynamics. 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.999
 Generally, if our endothelium is damaged, our arteries will be stiff. 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.159
 Making our heart more difficult to pump blood 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.269
 But compared to placebo, through curcumin or exercise 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.590
 We can let the blood pressure drop 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.680
 And if you combine the two, then you are really invincible. 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.249
 They concluded that these findings indicate 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.989
 Regular endurance exercise combined with daily intake of curcumin 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.359
 More than one method 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.079
 May reduce the pressure on the heart to a greater extent 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.000
 So for our endothelial health, eat and combine it.
