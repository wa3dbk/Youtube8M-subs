00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
 Hello friends 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 puri I will bring to light a very interesting subject 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.870
 or better known as kinect for xbox 360 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.959
 let's start with a good point 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.000
 is a project that works for the xbox 360 this project consists of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.340
 an apparatus capable of taking movement super sensitive and fast thanks to 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.619
 its teachers 7 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.150
 in both the movement of the legs and arms and will adapt the return of the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.619
 virtual player 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.369
 The best thing about this team is that 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.300
 maybe he bought 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.780
 kinect is a simple copy of the wii 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 although this fabulous devices 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.260
 new developments such as tasting and audio and you arrests and things like that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.830
 but this is still a 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.760
 the study and pathetic copy 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.400
 if we start thinking it will only bring something we will have to buy games 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.720
 family children 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.000
 because we were born and waiting is different 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.249
 little or 2 4 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.800
 another some game of sudden movements 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.970
 I think this is a job 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.960
 now let's continue with the ps3 to its control no longer better known as moby 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.560
 so the cinema was a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230
 this mess 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.650
 since the controls are the same in any point of view 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 in addition the game odds are totally equal Arabic if we look with 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.720
 detail the young 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.390
 we ask for a clear copy of the mail 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.840
 to fuck this one I do not have to say it's a complete block and it sucks 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.960
 so let's leave it until late 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480
 now in summary 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.930
 Why is this happening 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.450
 everyone wants to win everyone wants their console to be seventh generation 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 they know that nintendo wins them by a lot is not a little bit is not a little bit 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.869
 a lot of smoke and as you know it's a lot they try to match it up to beat them 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.729
 then they start being stupid 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.460
 to fuck that to xente in the defeat or that at least know to be original 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.270
 although the kinect has much to be desired and not much to say as it is 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.180
 a shit like the tan for me the original will always be useless and 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.280
 his wii motion before we used to be very original goodbye and live nintendo xd
