00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Did you know that the  Nokia Lumia 1020 camera

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:06.041
is considered one of the best smartphone cameras ?

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.390
The 41 mega pixel gives you the ability to 
 capture the smallest details in the picture

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:14.458
Do you want to learn how to use the camera to take professional images

00:00:14.558 --> 00:00:18.558
watch this new Tips &amp;amp; Tricks episode

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:21.755
 in which you will learn the ideal way 

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:25.637
to take professional images using the Nokia Lumia 1020 camera

00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:27.017
presented to you by axiom

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
let's start by taking a picture from above this bridge

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:36.109
we are tying to achieve

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.509
is the light streaks effect

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:42.507
while at the same time, ensuring the accuracy of the image

00:00:42.507 --> 00:00:44.913
we are opening the Nokia Pro Cam application

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:48.913
Then we zoom in a little so that 
 the bridge doesn't appear in the frame

00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:01.025
we now change the value of the exposure

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:05.024
the exposure is the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:07.024
let's leave it zero for now

00:01:10.827 --> 00:01:12.827
now let's change the shutter speed

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:15.107
which is the speed of the opening and closing of the lens

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.815
to get the light streaks effect

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:20.815
the shutter speed should be very slow

00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:24.228
therefore, we are choosing 3.2 seconds

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.277
now we choose the ISO value

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:31.277
this is an acronym of International Standards Organization

00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.709
and it's the third factor with the shutter speed and apreture

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.109
in determining the exposure of the image

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.901
the lower the ISO, the lower the amount of light reaching the sensor

00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.900
and the image will be sharp

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.602
and the higher the ISO, the greater the light will reach the sensor

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:46.434
and the image becomes noisy

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:49.130
therefore we choose the ISO 100

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:52.320
now let's adjust the position of the camera

00:01:57.802 --> 00:02:00.800
Please be aware in case of slow shutter speed

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it is imperative that the camera is held still

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.050
otherwise the image will be blurred

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.660
now we will do some changes

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
we are increasing the value of the exposure to 1.7

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.800
and make the shutter speed 2 instead of 3.2 seconds

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.200
the reason for this is that 3.2 seconds is 
 a long time to close the lens

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.670
this is the final image

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:42.820
let's now take a picture of the skyscraper scenery

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.067
since the lighting is low

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:49.170
we will increase the exposure to 1.30

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:50.000
change the shutter speed to 2 seconds

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
change the shutter speed to 2 seconds

00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:07.050
and finally make the ISO 400 to allow 
 sufficient amout of light to the sensor

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.050
and finally make the ISO 400 to allow 
 sufficient amout of light to the sensor

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.270
this is the final image

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
here are some images that were taken by the Nokia Lumia 1020 camera

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.200
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Tips &amp;amp; Tricks
