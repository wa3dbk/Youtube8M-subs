00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
and a pancake lens some purists actually

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.340 
and a pancake lens some purists actually
say<00:01:09.910> that<00:01:10.210> they're<00:01:10.330> not<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> pancake<00:01:11.140> lens

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
say that they're not a pancake lens

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.690 
say that they're not a pancake lens
because<00:01:11.800> there<00:01:11.950> are<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.040> couple<00:01:12.130> hairs<00:01:12.460> too

actually<00:01:28.180> be<00:01:28.660> 75<00:01:29.410> millimetres<00:01:29.950> because<00:01:30.220> of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
actually be 75 millimetres because of

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.950 
actually be 75 millimetres because of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
all the work for you is easy but your

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.850 
all the work for you is easy but your
images<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:55.899> video<00:01:56.140> will<00:01:56.350> come<00:01:56.530> out<00:01:56.560> much

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
better if you set all the settings

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.560 
better if you set all the settings
yourself<00:01:59.110> and<00:01:59.670> customize<00:02:00.670> them<00:02:00.940> for<00:02:01.119> each

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
yourself and customize them for each

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.990 
yourself and customize them for each
lighting<00:02:01.960> situation<00:02:02.679> that<00:02:03.399> being<00:02:03.610> said<00:02:03.850> these

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
lighting situation that being said these

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.029 
lighting situation that being said these
lenses<00:02:04.390> may<00:02:04.630> look<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.990> same<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:05.679> let's<00:02:05.890> do

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
lenses may look the same but let's do

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.680 
lenses may look the same but let's do
some<00:02:06.220> tests<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.640> see<00:02:06.729> what<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.149> images<00:02:07.539> say

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
some tests and see what the images say

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.600 
some tests and see what the images say

all of these clips were done with

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.790 
all of these clips were done with
aperture<00:02:09.910> set<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.360> 2.8<00:02:10.840> which<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> star

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
working properly this nikkor that I

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.270 
working properly this nikkor that I
picked<00:04:39.870> up<00:04:39.990> has<00:04:40.230> some<00:04:40.440> wear<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.680> tear<00:04:40.950> on<00:04:41.250> the
