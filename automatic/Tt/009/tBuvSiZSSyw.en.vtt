terminals that your connect the wire to
you<00:00:59.620> can<00:00:59.800> think<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.159> one<00:01:00.399> terminal<00:01:00.670> ascends

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
you can think of one terminal ascends

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.540 
you can think of one terminal ascends
one<00:01:01.780> terminal<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.319> receive<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.339> fence

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
one terminal is receive and the fence

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.330 
one terminal is receive and the fence
has<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.940> form<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.300> loop<00:01:04.540> from<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.680> Center<00:01:06.130> one

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
has to form a loop from the Center one

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.249 
has to form a loop from the Center one
or<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.880> received<00:01:07.270> terminal<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.930> the

transmitter a more built that picture as

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.260 
transmitter a more built that picture as
we<00:01:11.229> go<00:01:11.409> first<00:01:12.310> thing<00:01:12.490> we've<00:01:12.640> done<00:01:12.850> here<00:01:13.119> is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
we go first thing we've done here is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.440 
we go first thing we've done here is
connected<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.960> twisted<00:01:14.530> pair<00:01:14.920> wire<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
connected the twisted pair wire to the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780 
connected the twisted pair wire to the
transmitter<00:01:16.899> terminals<00:01:17.579> twisted<00:01:18.579> pair<00:01:18.759> wires

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
transmitter terminals twisted pair wires

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.060 
transmitter terminals twisted pair wires
its<00:01:19.329> name<00:01:19.509> suggests<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.259> pair<00:01:20.680> of<00:01:20.710> wires

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
its name suggests is a pair of wires

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.679 
its name suggests is a pair of wires
that<00:01:21.219> are<00:01:21.460> twisted<00:01:21.579> together<00:01:22.299> they're

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
that are twisted together they're

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.300 
that are twisted together they're
separately<00:01:23.079> insulated<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.860> twisted

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
separately insulated and twisted

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.940 
separately insulated and twisted
together<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.600> effect<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:26.079> this<00:01:26.259> is<00:01:26.590> that<00:01:26.649> they

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
together the effect of this is that they

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.029 
together the effect of this is that they
carry<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.640> signal<00:01:28.030> from<00:01:28.240> A<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.540> B<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.829> this

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
carry the signal from A to B in this

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.760 
carry the signal from A to B in this
case<00:01:30.310> from<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.729> transmitter<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.960> signal

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
case from the transmitter to the signal

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.639 
case from the transmitter to the signal
boundary<00:01:33.369> but<00:01:34.240> they<00:01:34.360> do<00:01:34.420> not<00:01:34.899> transmit<00:01:35.350> that

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
boundary but they do not transmit that

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.550 
boundary but they do not transmit that
signal<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:36.369> your<00:01:36.700> dog's<00:01:37.060> collar<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:38.289> means

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
signal to your dog's collar this means

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.039 
signal to your dog's collar this means
that<00:01:39.159> your<00:01:39.310> dog<00:01:39.579> can<00:01:39.610> cross<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.539> blue<00:01:40.810> line

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
that your dog can cross that blue line

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.649 
that your dog can cross that blue line
so<00:01:41.289> twisted<00:01:41.649> pair<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:41.979> very<00:01:42.250> useful<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:43.390> carry

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
so twisted pair is very useful to carry

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.840 
so twisted pair is very useful to carry
the<00:01:43.840> fence<00:01:44.079> signal<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:44.680> not<00:01:44.979> broadcast<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
the fence signal but not broadcast it to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.569 
the fence signal but not broadcast it to
your<00:01:45.969> dog's<00:01:46.210> color<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> end<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
your dog's color at the end of the

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.279 
your dog's color at the end of the
twisted<00:01:48.969> pair<00:01:49.119> wire<00:01:49.359> we've<00:01:49.570> connected<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> pair

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
twisted pair wire we've connected a pair

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.889 
twisted pair wire we've connected a pair

devices and the horizontal parts of the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.330 
devices and the horizontal parts of the
tee<00:01:55.060> you'll<00:01:55.630> connect<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.109> wire<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.890> vertical
