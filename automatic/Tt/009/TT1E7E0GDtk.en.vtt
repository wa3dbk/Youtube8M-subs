and a new icon and it was also quite a
rebellious<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.280> sort<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.610> punk<00:00:30.450> and<00:00:30.750> archaic

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
rebellious and sort of punk and archaic

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.670 
rebellious and sort of punk and archaic
sort<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.890> act<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.940> first<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:33.510> there<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sort of act when we first got there it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
sort of act when we first got there it
was<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.370> tamper<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> logo<00:00:36.690> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
was like don't tamper with the logo it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
was like don't tamper with the logo it's
an<00:00:37.770> icon<00:00:38.370> don't<00:00:38.880> tamper<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.720> it<00:00:40.130> so<00:00:41.130> I<00:00:41.460> looked

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
an icon don't tamper with it so I looked

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
an icon don't tamper with it so I looked
at<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.239> monogram<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.649> thought<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.190> Stephen

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
at the monogram and I thought of Stephen

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.210 
at the monogram and I thought of Stephen
I<00:00:45.030> loved<00:00:45.540> his<00:00:45.750> hand<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> his<00:00:46.470> graffiti<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.130> I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
I loved his hand and his graffiti and I

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.370 
I loved his hand and his graffiti and I
thought<00:00:47.430> I'll<00:00:47.670> ask<00:00:48.090> him<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.660> write<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.079> over

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
thought I'll ask him to write all over

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.530 
thought I'll ask him to write all over
the<00:00:49.739> monogram<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.970> would<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.450> of

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
the monogram so it would be kind of

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.600 
the monogram so it would be kind of
defacing<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.220> making<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
defacing it but actually making it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.930 
defacing it but actually making it
really<00:00:53.970> loud<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.210> young<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:55.520> think<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> came<00:00:56.760> as

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
really loud and young I think it came as

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.750 
really loud and young I think it came as
a<00:00:56.969> surprise<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.140> people<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.730> know
