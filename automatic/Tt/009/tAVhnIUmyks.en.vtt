the slowest foot and it's travelling up
his<00:02:18.210> car<00:02:18.420> could<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.110> please<00:02:19.350> move<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
his car could you please move that in a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.620 
his car could you please move that in a
different<00:02:20.220> directions<00:02:20.730> nobody<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.300> do<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
different directions nobody can do is

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.030 
different directions nobody can do is
you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.810> actually<00:02:21.990> use<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.290> force<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.920> your

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
you can actually use that force to your

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
you can actually use that force to your
advantage<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.180> doesn't<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.690> be

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
advantage so it doesn't just have to be

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330 
advantage so it doesn't just have to be
absorbed<00:02:25.320> by<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.710> around<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.040> store<00:02:26.250> they

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
absorbed by going around the store they

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.590 
absorbed by going around the store they
can<00:02:26.460> actually<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.000> back<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.210> make<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
can actually go out the back and make it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.720 
can actually go out the back and make it
go<00:02:27.690> faster<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.970> need<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> pair<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> those

is in the design of the studs on the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.470 
is in the design of the studs on the
boot<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.680> we<00:02:41.769> can<00:02:41.950> do<00:02:42.129> is<00:02:42.480> manipulate

boot and what we can do is manipulate
these<00:02:43.989> studs<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> thicker<00:02:45.640> the

by<00:03:03.700> zooming<00:03:04.150> into<00:03:04.299> one<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> studs<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.620> can

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
by zooming into one of the studs you can

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.039 
by zooming into one of the studs you can
see<00:03:05.890> those<00:03:06.040> stud<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:07.239> even<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.690> studies

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
see those stud here but even the studies

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.630 
see those stud here but even the studies
thought<00:03:08.260> has<00:03:08.440> thousands<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.010> points<00:03:09.190> where<00:03:09.610> a

of<00:04:07.950> putting<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.580> mean<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.360> think<00:04:09.570> about

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
of putting it I mean if you think about

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.590 
of putting it I mean if you think about
yeah<00:04:09.930> you're<00:04:10.350> growing<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.920> part<00:04:11.360> inside<00:04:12.360> all

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
yeah you're growing a part inside all

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.500 
yeah you're growing a part inside all
this<00:04:12.750> powder<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:14.280> powder<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.910> outside

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
this powder the powder on the outside

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
this powder the powder on the outside
acts<00:04:15.840> as<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.110> support<00:04:16.380> structure<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.459> also

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
acts as a support structure and also

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.990 
acts as a support structure and also
slows<00:04:18.600> down<00:04:18.900> cooling<00:04:19.500> avoiding<00:04:20.340> distortions

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
slows down cooling avoiding distortions

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.370 
slows down cooling avoiding distortions
