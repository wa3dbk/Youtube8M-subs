paid for I've been telling my wife this
for<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.700> size<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.210> matter

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
for your size doesn't matter

for your size doesn't matter
and<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and and I really think that when it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
and and I really think that when it
comes<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.560> Reba<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.369> heart

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
comes to Reba I just think it's heart

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
comes to Reba I just think it's heart
heart<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> effort<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> guy's<00:01:34.829> got

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
heart and effort and I think a guy's got

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.350 
heart and effort and I think a guy's got
to<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.850> play

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to just go out there and play

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
to just go out there and play
I<00:01:36.590> think<00:01:37.590> Todd<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I think Todd when I got to get to the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
I think Todd when I got to get to the
point<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.630> every<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.409> don't<00:01:40.590> do

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
point is that every time they don't do

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
point is that every time they don't do
something<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.400> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.180> practice

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
something what we want to do in practice

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
something what we want to do in practice
we<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.259> put<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> treadmill<00:01:43.920> or

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
we just put them on the treadmill or

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
we just put them on the treadmill or
push-ups<00:01:45.060> we've<00:01:45.240> done<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.930> bit

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
push-ups we've done that a little bit

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.780 
push-ups we've done that a little bit
but<00:01:46.500> we'll<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.130> consistent<00:01:47.520> with

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
but we'll just be more consistent with

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.609 
but we'll just be more consistent with
it<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.509> when<00:01:48.810> you've<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> young<00:01:49.350> team

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it to me when you've got a young team

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
it to me when you've got a young team
it's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.520> house<00:01:50.729> training<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.240> puppy

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's a lot like house training a puppy

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.530 
it's a lot like house training a puppy
dog<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.649> when<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> dog<00:01:53.540> does

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.219
