00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
equipment in fact it's really easy to

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.269 
equipment in fact it's really easy to
overload<00:00:31.079> it<00:00:31.140> quite<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> lot<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.919> like<00:00:32.070> I've

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
overload it quite a lot but like I've

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.810 
overload it quite a lot but like I've
done<00:00:32.460> here

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
done here

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
done here
but<00:00:33.150> I<00:00:33.180> thought<00:00:33.390> sure<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> different

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
but I thought sure all the different

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.160 
but I thought sure all the different
bits<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.310> guess<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.720> bag<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.900> could

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
bits I guess is a sort of bag you could

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
bits I guess is a sort of bag you could
take<00:00:37.350> hiking<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> basically<00:00:38.520> fit<00:00:38.700> most<00:00:38.970> if

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
outside of the bag and then to get the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.920 
outside of the bag and then to get the
unusual<00:02:04.550> thing<00:02:04.730> about<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.000> flip<00:02:05.180> side<00:02:05.420> is<00:02:05.720> if

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
unusual thing about the flip side is if

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.810 
unusual thing about the flip side is if
you<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.650> imagine<00:02:06.740> you're<00:02:07.010> wearing<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.430> like

that with you sort of the bodies on this
side<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:11.060> actually<00:02:11.300> get<00:02:11.510> at<00:02:11.690> everything<00:02:12.170> your

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
side to actually get at everything your

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
side to actually get at everything your
main<00:02:12.980> camera<00:02:13.370> compartments<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:14.990> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
main camera compartments you have to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.490 
main camera compartments you have to
take<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.220> off<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.870> then<00:02:17.870> you've<00:02:17.990> got<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.230> open

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
take it off and then you've got to open

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.900 
take it off and then you've got to open
up<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.780> side<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> advantage<00:02:22.610> of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
up from this side now the advantage of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.310 
up from this side now the advantage of
this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.270> that<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.540> keeps<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:23.990> your<00:02:24.140> main
