00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.330 

this<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> an<00:03:28.870> ancillary<00:03:29.470> we<00:03:29.799> have<00:03:29.950> three<00:03:30.250> of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
this is an ancillary we have three of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
these a frog the earthworm in the human

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:44.300 
these a frog the earthworm in the human
body<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.129> if<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.310> minimize<00:03:33.519> this<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.560> hit<00:03:35.560> play

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310

but<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.520> file<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.300> linked<00:03:46.810> directly<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.680> my

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
but that file is linked directly to my

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.420 
but that file is linked directly to my
PowerPoint<00:03:48.520> from<00:03:49.480> that<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> escaped<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.500> so

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
PowerPoint from that I escaped and so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.040 
PowerPoint from that I escaped and so
now<00:03:51.610> I've<00:03:51.910> got<00:03:52.090> three<00:03:52.330> different<00:03:52.420> ways<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.900> do

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
now I've got three different ways to do
