the criteria as a dt nano a gun but it's

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.810 
the criteria as a dt nano a gun but it's

now for a got to come in it depends

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.800 
now for a got to come in it depends
entirely<00:01:58.730> with<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.210> middle<00:01:59.450> linebacker

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
entirely with that middle linebacker

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.170 
entirely with that middle linebacker
does<00:02:03.160> sit<00:02:04.160> at<00:02:04.280> middle<00:02:04.490> linebacker<00:02:04.520> when<00:02:05.060> she

baseline he moves around and stuff and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.400 
baseline he moves around and stuff and
I'm<00:02:09.440> his<00:02:09.710> position<00:02:10.130> kind<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.670> fixed<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:12.260> it's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'm his position kind of fixed but it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.640 
I'm his position kind of fixed but it's
going<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> egg<00:02:13.460> up<00:02:13.610> or<00:02:13.760> big<00:02:13.940> up<00:02:14.500> not<00:02:15.500> like
