00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.500
 games not like mario's sow and also 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.469

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.230
 comes for the wii u but this one would be in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.200
 2015 and there would also be two 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 nintendo titles that are not yet in 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 Paraguayan to Siqueiros Mr. Shigeru 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 miyamoto ok so you know it's coming 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 new star fox but we will have to wait 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.100
 until 2015 not and the truth is very 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.280
 cool I saw a bit of the trailer but what 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.159
 I see today just today 11 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 and this came out on the 10th and it was very, very 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.229
 very good the truth I 'm not so 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.909
 star fox fan but if you played him 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.659
 a couple of times and if I liked it but 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.580
 I eat as someone who is rarely 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.680
 judge starfox has distinguished walking 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.810
 cool this if I 'm going to give you everything 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.670
 same thing that happened with mario kart 8 not be 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.220
 I was not so much to play Mario either 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 kart but in the end as they see me I'm 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.180
 is playing it with everything not what it is 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240
 normal is fine is fine or is this 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.920
 It is addictive and apart what I like the most 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.570
 that the community is , the people who 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.830
 has grown with nintendo because almost 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.420
 all of us who are big have 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.890
 grown with nintendo the moments very 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.450
 happy with the conference but not good 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.090
 it's a theme that the area part so not 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.819
 know new star fox comes with everything 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.880
 thanks higuero and the most important thing 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:57.560
 also the legend of zelda for the wii 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.539
 nintendo at his convention already showed the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.819
 new zelda that the truth is very good 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's a mix of the wind waker with something 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.920
 more super arch 13 is great 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.520
 zelda yes 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.459
 open world cell inclusive 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.500
 the creator of being the one who is called age and 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.050
 forgiveness of the nintendo jiji producer 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.489
 still uma spoke a little about the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.880
 soldier saying he wants to make a world 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.190
 super open and will have the same what 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.330
 same puzzle and other than your thing 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.950
 it's going to be the same whether it's the 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.209
 always the classic is the story goes to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.720
 be whale the puzzles to be 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.980
 good the difficulty or they are not going to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.260
 alter almost nothing the only thing that they are going to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.330
 to do is that this new zelda also 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.250
 be adaptable for new players or 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.959
 be new hardcore players so 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.300
 say it if this is a person who 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.150
 he finished the cell in the time of the super 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.100
 nintendo and nintendo 64 with that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.440
 difficulty will do the same in this 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.660
 new zelda but with him suddenly they are going to 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 burn of difficulty is not normal easy 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.410
 the classic is not the most likely 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.230
 put the classic for the people that is 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.269
 super is not known now the game and you 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.500
 like to break your head or suddenly 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.470
 picture 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.319
 newby is not a novice which would be for 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.910
 new people and the puzzles would be a 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.730
 little bit easier for them that's what 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.300
 that a little bit of him 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.350
 there he still did not play 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.240
 even numa ok it's going to be going to have what 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.950
 classic as always and also going to have 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.410
 an action for the new ones is us 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.750
 perfect sea is fine so people 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.310
