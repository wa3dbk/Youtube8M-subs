00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.109 
and white one and the yellow one that I
should<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> earlier<00:01:17.310> can't<00:01:17.580> came<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> bunch<00:01:18.060> of

should you earlier can't came a bunch of
different<00:01:18.210> colors<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
different colors so that's just what the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.800 
different colors so that's just what the
top<00:01:20.850> looks<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.970> then<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> bottoms

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.039 

which<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.170> came<00:01:29.100> apart<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.900> could<00:01:30.900> have

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
which it just came apart so could have

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
which it just came apart so could have
tighten<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.530> anyway<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.360> bottoms<00:01:33.630> do

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
tighten those anyway so the bottoms do

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.340 
tighten those anyway so the bottoms do
come<00:01:34.110> apart<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.350> fix

come apart so I'm going to have to fix
those<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.130> can't<00:01:38.400> come<00:01:38.640> apart<00:01:38.970> but

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
those so then they can't come apart but

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
those so then they can't come apart but
there's<00:01:40.049> white<00:01:40.350> bottoms<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
there's white bottoms and then they have
