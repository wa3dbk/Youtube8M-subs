actually<00:00:10.050> ask<00:00:10.620> if<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.430> can<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.760> done<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.720> is

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
actually ask if this can be done this is

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.320 
actually ask if this can be done this is
a<00:00:13.110> cultural<00:00:13.680> marble<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.460> cracking<00:00:15.090> and

a cultural marble and is cracking and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.679 
a cultural marble and is cracking and
what<00:00:15.930> it<00:00:16.049> does<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:17.010> actually<00:00:17.369> sinking<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
what it does is just actually sinking so

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.230 
what it does is just actually sinking so
it<00:00:18.900> needs<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.259> be<00:00:19.409> brought<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.669> needs<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.089> be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it needs to be brought up it needs to be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.870 
it needs to be brought up it needs to be
reinforced<00:00:21.929> and<00:00:22.499> it<00:00:22.650> needs<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.099> be<00:00:23.220> repaired

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
thinking about replacing this button

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.419 
thinking about replacing this button
because<00:00:38.120> as<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.359> can<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.500> developed<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
because as you can see it developed a

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.950 
because as you can see it developed a
crack<00:00:42.269> a<00:00:43.010> fine<00:00:44.010> crack<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.570> around

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
crack a fine crack all the way around

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.630 
crack a fine crack all the way around
here<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:48.350> well<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.100> very<00:00:50.309> first

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
here and well you know the very first

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
here and well you know the very first
thing<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:50.910> thinks<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.829> replace<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
thing he thinks is I will replace the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.959 
thing he thinks is I will replace the
top<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.749> the<00:00:55.190> people<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> give<00:00:56.699> them<00:00:56.850> an

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
top but now the people that give them an

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.290 
top but now the people that give them an
estimate<00:00:57.480> says<00:00:57.749> no<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.300> remove

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
estimate says no you also have to remove

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.989 
estimate says no you also have to remove
the<00:01:00.510> shower<00:01:00.749> sole<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> whole

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
the shower sole and really do the whole

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.080 
the shower sole and really do the whole
thing<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.500> estimate<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.489> over<00:01:05.730> six

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
thing so the estimate was for over six

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
thing so the estimate was for over six
thousand<00:01:06.540> dollars<00:01:07.100> well<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.370> lot<00:01:08.550> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
thousand dollars well that's a lot of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.850 
thousand dollars well that's a lot of

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
do then we're going to bring force under

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.050 
do then we're going to bring force under
the<00:01:14.820> bathtub<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:16.460> we're<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.730> have

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

the bathtub and we're going to have
access<00:01:18.480> through<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> top<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> top<00:01:19.620> we're

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
access through the top of the top we're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.250 
access through the top of the top we're
going<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.310> some<00:01:20.550> holes<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.120> put<00:01:22.050> some

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
going to make some holes and put some

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.430 
going to make some holes and put some
very<00:01:22.440> strong<00:01:22.920> stuff<00:01:23.310> that'll<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.840> feeling

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
very strong stuff that'll the feeling

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.370 
very strong stuff that'll the feeling
the<00:01:25.590> gap<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> top<00:01:27.300> can<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:28.080> stay

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the gap so the top can actually stay

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
the gap so the top can actually stay
where<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> without<00:01:29.040> moving<00:01:29.580> any<00:01:29.730> more<00:01:29.900> and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
where it is without moving any more and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
where it is without moving any more and
we're<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.440> repair<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.820> hairline

we're going to repair all those hairline
cracks<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.220> reopen<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.180> then

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
cracks so they don't reopen and then

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.750 
cracks so they don't reopen and then
we're<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> refinish<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:37.980> tub<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
similar color of what it is so it blends

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.960 
similar color of what it is so it blends
with<00:01:41.580> everything<00:01:41.970> else<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:43.550> once<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:44.760> have<00:01:44.940> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the refinish of this butter let me show

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.390 
the refinish of this butter let me show
you<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:57.330> here<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.470> did<00:01:58.620> we<00:01:58.890> refinished
