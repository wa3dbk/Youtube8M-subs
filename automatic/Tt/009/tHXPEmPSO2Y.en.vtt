00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.330 
trophy system and I found some
interesting<00:00:10.830> things<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:13.340> haven't

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
interesting things about it I haven't

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
interesting things about it I haven't
been<00:00:14.460> using<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.940> haven't<00:00:15.420> I've<00:00:15.839> never<00:00:16.020> used

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
been using the I haven't I've never used

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.200 
been using the I haven't I've never used
the<00:00:16.500> trophy<00:00:17.100> system<00:00:17.369> until<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> did<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:17.970> game

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the trophy system until it did one game

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.200 
the trophy system until it did one game
but<00:00:18.930> then<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.340> questioning<00:00:20.760> can

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
but then get really like questioning can

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.370 
but then get really like questioning can
I<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.420> more<00:00:21.600> than<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.050> can

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
I do more than what it actually can

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.870 
I do more than what it actually can
because<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.010> don't<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.340> well<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because if you don't know well what the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
because if you don't know well what the
trophy<00:00:24.119> system<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.680> this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
trophy system is it's a it's like this

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.120 
trophy system is it's a it's like this
little<00:00:26.449> thing<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.900> down<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
little thing you put down and what it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
little thing you put down and what it
does<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:30.000> enemy<00:00:30.119> talks<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> flashbang

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
does is an enemy talks like a flashbang

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.680 
does is an enemy talks like a flashbang
grenade<00:00:31.619> near<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.369> area<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.300> that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
grenade near your area that little that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
grenade near your area that little that
little<00:00:33.750> system<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:35.130> blow<00:00:35.309> up

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
little system you put down will blow up

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.670 
little system you put down will blow up
the<00:00:35.520> stuff<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> midair<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.750> uh<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the stuff in midair but uh I think it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
the stuff in midair but uh I think it
can<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.610> only<00:00:38.730> destroy<00:00:39.030> three

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
can I think it can only destroy three

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
can I think it can only destroy three
but<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> can't<00:00:40.260> destroyed<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.680> than

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but if it can't destroyed more than

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
but if it can't destroyed more than
three<00:00:41.040> after<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.329> blows<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
three after three it like blows up and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.049 
three after three it like blows up and
all<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:46.079> experimenting<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.219> split

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
all so I was experimenting in a split

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
all so I was experimenting in a split
screen<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:48.870> i<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.200> able<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.469> open

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
screen which think i was able to open

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.360 
screen which think i was able to open
the<00:00:49.920> door<00:00:50.610> yeah<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> custom<00:00:51.960> games<00:00:52.370> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the door yeah and the custom games I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
the door yeah and the custom games I
just<00:00:53.879> few<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.180> had<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.870> second<00:00:55.230> controller

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just few much had the second controller

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
just few much had the second controller
just<00:00:55.649> killed<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> first<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.489> several<00:00:57.059> times

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just killed the first one several times

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.580

we're in modern warfare 3 how the trophy
system<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.130> um<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.880> could<00:01:12.090> destroy<00:01:12.270> um

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
system was like um it could destroy um

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.880 
system was like um it could destroy um
oh<00:01:14.810> my<00:01:15.810> god<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.140> could<00:01:16.259> destroy<00:01:16.380> predator

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
oh my god they could destroy predator

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
oh my god they could destroy predator
missiles<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:18.090> were<00:01:18.180> destroyed<00:01:18.540> like

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
missiles if they were destroyed like

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
missiles if they were destroyed like
Reapers<00:01:19.200> don't<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.680> Reapers<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Reapers don't like Reapers all like that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630 
Reapers don't like Reapers all like that
stuff<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.810> missiles<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> tried<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
stuff like missiles at all so I tried it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.230 
stuff like missiles at all so I tried it
out<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.920> seeing<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.220> could<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.700> here

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
out here seeing what it could do so here

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.310 
out here seeing what it could do so here
it<00:01:27.299> first<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.470> hunter<00:01:29.009> killer<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it first off is the hunter killer it can

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
it first off is the hunter killer it can
destroy<00:01:34.530> hunter<00:01:35.100> killers<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.939> from

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
destroy hunter killers and I got it from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.330 
destroy hunter killers and I got it from
another<00:01:36.180> view<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:39.540> pretty<00:01:39.630> cool

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
another view right here it's pretty cool

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.179 
another view right here it's pretty cool
and<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.860> author

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and all right here I think is the author

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.580 
and all right here I think is the author
of<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.720> hellstorm<00:01:46.200> missile<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.140> just

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
of the hellstorm missile so this is just

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
of the hellstorm missile so this is just
like<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:50.189> pressing<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.909> chair<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.390> right

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
like not pressing the chair of the right

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
like not pressing the chair of the right
trigger<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:52.979> leaving<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
trigger this is like just leaving it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.069 
trigger this is like just leaving it
there<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> regular<00:01:54.240> predator<00:01:54.570> missile<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there as a regular predator missile and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
there as a regular predator missile and
now<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.799> right<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.600> kind

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
now you'll see right here this is kind

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.990 
now you'll see right here this is kind
of<00:01:57.899> funny

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.510 

certain<00:02:05.000> Isis<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.570> then<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.750> go<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.040> maybe<00:02:07.040> what

missiles with the hell storm and then

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.110 
missiles with the hell storm and then
the<00:02:15.320> result<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.860> right<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.430> doesn't<00:02:16.880> stop

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
the result is right here it doesn't stop

person that's doing the hellstorm
missile<00:02:29.330> duh<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.500> leaving<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.830> normally

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
missile duh is just leaving it normally

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.400 
missile duh is just leaving it normally
like<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.580> regular<00:02:31.820> predator<00:02:32.360> missile<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
like a regular predator missile then you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.690 
like a regular predator missile then you
can<00:02:33.530> pull<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.830> trophy<00:02:33.980> system<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.520> saved

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
can pull up the trophy system and saved

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.020 
can pull up the trophy system and saved
your<00:02:34.820> own<00:02:34.850> life<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.840> um<00:02:36.550> that's<00:02:37.550> probably

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
your own life but um that's probably

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.450 
your own life but um that's probably
like<00:02:38.210> hard<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.110> even<00:02:39.290> try<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> that's<00:02:40.130> even

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
like hard to even try to that's even

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.220 
like hard to even try to that's even
that's<00:02:40.610> probably<00:02:40.970> hardly<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.570> lot<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.140> people

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
that's probably hardly a lot of people

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.840 
that's probably hardly a lot of people
don't<00:02:43.010> even<00:02:43.070> do<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.430> should<00:02:43.460> always<00:02:43.820> use

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
don't even do it they should always use

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't even do it they should always use
that<00:02:44.000> multi<00:02:44.600> missile<00:02:44.870> thing<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.680> one

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
that multi missile thing and I have one

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.420 
that multi missile thing and I have one
here<00:02:46.370> um<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:47.060> was<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.900> what<00:02:48.380> about<00:02:48.410> swarm<00:02:48.980> you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
here um I was like what about swarm you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550 
here um I was like what about swarm you
know<00:02:49.520> that<00:02:49.670> last<00:02:49.940> kill<00:02:50.840> streak<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.230> all<00:02:51.320> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
know that last kill streak and all it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.680 
know that last kill streak and all it
can<00:02:52.310> destroy<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.270> problem<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
can destroy it but the problem is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.300 
can destroy it but the problem is
there's<00:02:54.110> always<00:02:54.500> two<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.920> comment<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.190> at

you'll<00:02:56.600> see<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.990> put<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.470> down<00:02:57.500> doesn't<00:02:58.430> get

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
you'll see I put you down doesn't get

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.620 
you'll see I put you down doesn't get
that<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:59.200> doesn't<00:03:00.200> get<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.530> one<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:02.210> for<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
that one doesn't get that one so for the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.540 
that one doesn't get that one so for the
swarms<00:03:03.020> like<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.440> may<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.620> lucky<00:03:03.920> if<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.430> have

swarms like you may be lucky if you have

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.870 
swarms like you may be lucky if you have
like<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.820> bunch<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.570> friends<00:03:05.840> together<00:03:06.050> and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.220 
like you just put like a crapload of
trophy<00:03:11.120> systems<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.540> maybe<00:03:11.750> like<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.989> good

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
of trophy systems so I hope the hope

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.280 
of trophy systems so I hope the hope
that<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:41.060> guys<00:03:41.390> learned<00:03:41.720> at<00:03:41.930> least<00:03:42.140> something
