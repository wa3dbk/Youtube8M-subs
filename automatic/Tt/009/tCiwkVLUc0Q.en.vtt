00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
anything doesn't matter anything which

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.620 
anything doesn't matter anything which
is<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:38.079> really<00:03:38.200> cool<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.700> that's<00:03:40.329> the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
is really really cool so that's the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
than just collars but I think color is

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.170 
than just collars but I think color is
probably<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> biggest<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.609> biggest<00:03:45.970> thing

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
probably the biggest the biggest thing

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180 
probably the biggest the biggest thing
