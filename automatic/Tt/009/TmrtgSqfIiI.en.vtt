and slowly move it out and look around
get<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> feel<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.719> any<00:00:48.719> trigger<00:00:49.140> points<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get a feel for any trigger points that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.639 
get a feel for any trigger points that
you<00:00:49.739> may<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> roll<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you may have so I'm going to roll it

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.319 

and<00:00:59.370> then<00:01:00.370> I'm<00:01:00.670> going<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.820> roll<00:01:01.059> back<00:01:01.300> down

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
and then I'm going to roll back down

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.540 
and then I'm going to roll back down
quickly<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.530> start<00:01:02.920> at<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> top<00:01:03.309> of<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
quickly and start at the top of the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.710 
quickly and start at the top of the
pelvis<00:01:04.320> top<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.560> glute<00:01:05.770> muscle<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pelvis top of the glute muscle and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.109 
pelvis top of the glute muscle and
notice<00:01:07.720> how<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.900> begin<00:01:08.350> by<00:01:08.590> leaning<00:01:09.580> back<00:01:09.820> so

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
notice how I begin by leaning back so

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.359 
notice how I begin by leaning back so
I'm<00:01:10.210> lying<00:01:10.570> back<00:01:10.869> so<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.320> lot<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.619> pressure<00:01:12.009> is

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
I'm lying back so a lot of pressure is

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.330 
I'm lying back so a lot of pressure is
now<00:01:13.150> on<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.810> upper<00:01:14.140> glute<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.560> as<00:01:15.190> I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
now on the upper glute and as I'm

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.310 
now on the upper glute and as I'm
rolling<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.850> ball<00:01:16.000> down<00:01:16.390> toward<00:01:16.869> down<00:01:17.170> my

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
rolling the ball down toward down my

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.920 
rolling the ball down toward down my
glute<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.800> begin<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.850> sit<00:01:19.330> up<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.540> bit<00:01:19.570> more<00:01:19.869> and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
glute I begin to sit up a bit more and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.680 
glute I begin to sit up a bit more and
that<00:01:20.140> just<00:01:20.350> creates<00:01:20.710> even<00:01:21.070> more<00:01:21.330> pressure<00:01:22.330> in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
that just creates even more pressure in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.840 
that just creates even more pressure in
that<00:01:22.750> target<00:01:23.380> area<00:01:23.500> more<00:01:23.890> weight<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.430> going

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
that target area more weight is going

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.999 
that target area more weight is going
down<00:01:25.270> onto<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.720> ball<00:01:25.930> so<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.500> want<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.920> make

down onto the ball so you want to make

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.740 
down onto the ball so you want to make
sure<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.250> you're<00:01:27.369> not<00:01:27.550> resisting<00:01:28.479> this

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
sure that you're not resisting this

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.420
