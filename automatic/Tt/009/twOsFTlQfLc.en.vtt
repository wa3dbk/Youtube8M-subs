00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
if you have a memory system and that's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.310 
if you have a memory system and that's
absolutely<00:00:40.770> fine<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.320> demonstration

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
absolutely fine but for demonstration

storage<00:00:46.530> unit<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.890> had<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> tree<00:00:47.310> farm

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
storage unit if you had a tree farm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
storage unit if you had a tree farm
using<00:00:47.790> MFR<00:00:48.270> you'd<00:00:48.480> probably<00:00:48.660> pump<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
using MFR you'd probably pump into this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.310 
using MFR you'd probably pump into this
and<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:49.980> full<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.400> wood<00:00:51.140> what<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.200> then

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and have it full of wood what you then

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
and have it full of wood what you then
do<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.370> item<00:00:53.970> conduits<00:00:54.270> or<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
do is you use item conduits or you can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
do is you use item conduits or you can
use<00:00:55.230> transfer<00:00:56.190> nodes<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.820> actually

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

is powering the molecular assemble below

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
is powering the molecular assemble below
it<00:01:03.690> same<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.829> this<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.549> powering

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it same on this one and it's powering

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.230 
it same on this one and it's powering
the<00:01:06.540> formation<00:01:07.049> plane<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> what

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the formation plane down here so what

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.639 
the formation plane down here so what
this<00:01:09.329> is<00:01:09.479> doing<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.020> pulling<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
this is doing is it's pulling out the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.410 
this is doing is it's pulling out the
oak<00:01:10.799> wood<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> crafting<00:01:11.909> patent<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
oak wood we have a crafting patent in

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
oak wood we have a crafting patent in
there<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:13.320> makes<00:01:13.560> four<00:01:13.860> planks<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.520> one

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there which makes four planks out of one

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.429 
there which makes four planks out of one
would<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.179> then<00:01:15.389> pulls<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:16.139> into

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
would that then pulls out there into

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.480 
would that then pulls out there into
this<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.799> molecular<00:01:17.100> assembler<00:01:17.990> which<00:01:18.990> has

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
this other molecular assembler which has

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.069 
this other molecular assembler which has
one<00:01:20.490> crafting<00:01:20.880> table<00:01:21.179> for<00:01:21.359> four<00:01:21.569> at<00:01:21.689> planks<00:01:22.049> so

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
one crafting table for four at planks so

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.559 
one crafting table for four at planks so
it's<00:01:22.259> coming<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:22.770> log<00:01:23.340> two<00:01:23.819> planks<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
it's coming from log two planks the

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's coming from log two planks the
crafting<00:01:25.020> table<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.829> deep<00:01:26.039> storage<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
crafting table two deep storage so and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.429 
crafting table two deep storage so and
then<00:01:27.209> the<00:01:27.359> deep<00:01:27.539> storage<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.959> then<00:01:28.109> linked<00:01:28.350> up

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
then the deep storage is then linked up

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
then the deep storage is then linked up
to<00:01:28.619> an<00:01:28.740> ami<00:01:28.950> interface<00:01:29.579> which<00:01:30.479> has<00:01:31.939> loads<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to an ami interface which has loads and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.459 
to an ami interface which has loads and
loads<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.270> crafting<00:01:33.630> tables<00:01:33.929> in<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
loads of crafting tables in it if you

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.199 
loads of crafting tables in it if you
look<00:01:34.709> up<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.459> that<00:01:35.609> links<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.179> a

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
look up and then that links up to a

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.910 
look up and then that links up to a
formation<00:01:36.689> plane<00:01:37.109> which<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
formation plane which I have the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
formation plane which I have the
priority<00:01:38.189> set<00:01:38.609> to<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.789> thousand<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.389> it's<00:01:39.450> got

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
priority set to a thousand so it's got

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
priority set to a thousand so it's got
the<00:01:39.689> highest<00:01:40.020> priority<00:01:40.469> over<00:01:40.709> the<00:01:40.740> network

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the highest priority over the network

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.389 
the highest priority over the network
and<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.840> sit<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.189> want

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and you just sit in here what you want

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
and you just sit in here what you want
to<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.639> in<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:44.999> we<00:01:45.179> want<00:01:45.450> crafting<00:01:45.810> tables<00:01:46.109> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to go in so we want crafting tables in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
to go in so we want crafting tables in
there<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.459> you<00:01:47.639> want<00:01:47.789> some<00:01:47.939> graph<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there just and you want some graph and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.319 
there just and you want some graph and
there<00:01:48.389> wasn't<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:49.880> there<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.029> and<00:01:51.209> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
there wasn't there there you go and then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.580 
there wasn't there there you go and then
that<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.600> pump<00:01:51.779> out<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:52.439> just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that will pump out and that will just

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.539 
that will pump out and that will just
keep<00:01:52.709> going<00:01:52.859> and<00:01:53.069> going<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.279> going

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
keep going and going and going

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.309 
keep going and going and going
you<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.789> your<00:01:53.909> hungry<00:01:54.179> node<00:01:54.389> encased<00:01:54.929> in<00:01:55.109> here

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
you got your hungry node encased in here

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.899 
you got your hungry node encased in here
you're<00:01:55.439> gonna<00:01:55.529> have<00:01:55.619> obsidian<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> top<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you're gonna have obsidian on the top of

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.339 
you're gonna have obsidian on the top of
course<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.359> only<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.929> it's<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.139> eat

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
course so the only way it's gonna eat

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.789 
course so the only way it's gonna eat
think<00:01:58.619> anything<00:01:59.069> is<00:01:59.249> from<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.639> bottom<00:02:00.799> which

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
think anything is from the bottom which

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.190 
think anything is from the bottom which
is<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.520> cool<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.029> you<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.569> I'll

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
is really cool so if you go in here I'll

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.169 
is really cool so if you go in here I'll
show<00:02:04.529> you<00:02:04.560> pretend<00:02:05.279> this<00:02:05.459> is<00:02:05.639> the<00:02:05.670> hungry<00:02:06.029> node

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
show you pretend this is the hungry node

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.909 
show you pretend this is the hungry node
I<00:02:06.209> couldn't<00:02:06.599> get<00:02:06.779> one<00:02:06.959> it<00:02:07.259> was<00:02:07.349> taken<00:02:07.590> far<00:02:07.770> too

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:07.919 
I couldn't get one it was taken far too

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:09.830 
I couldn't get one it was taken far too
long<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.270> soon<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.660> green

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
long but they go as soon as I'm green

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
long but they go as soon as I'm green
node<00:02:09.990> eats<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:10.470> gonna<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.649> replaced<00:02:11.160> back

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
node eats it it's gonna be replaced back

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400 
node eats it it's gonna be replaced back
so<00:02:12.180> you've<00:02:12.300> got<00:02:12.450> quite<00:02:12.750> an<00:02:12.870> efficient<00:02:13.200> tree

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so you've got quite an efficient tree

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.050 
so you've got quite an efficient tree
farm<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.890> will<00:02:14.069> definitely<00:02:14.550> keep<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.940> with

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
farm this will definitely keep up with

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750 
farm this will definitely keep up with
it<00:02:15.209> very<00:02:15.240> very<00:02:15.720> easily<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.520> shouldn't

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it very very easily and you shouldn't

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.880 
it very very easily and you shouldn't
have<00:02:17.819> any<00:02:18.060> problems<00:02:18.420> whatsoever<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.769> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
have any problems whatsoever but that is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.080 
have any problems whatsoever but that is
the<00:02:20.040> best<00:02:20.159> way<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.370> found<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.760> feed<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:20.970> hungry

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the best way I found a feed a hungry

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
the best way I found a feed a hungry
node<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.689> leave<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.079> somewhere<00:02:22.560> else<00:02:22.739> off

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
node you can leave it somewhere else off

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.100 
node you can leave it somewhere else off
in<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.250> distance<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.819> just

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
in the distance and just

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.390 
in the distance and just
but<00:02:24.260> running<00:02:24.410> with<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> chunk<00:02:24.890> load<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
but running with a chunk load on it I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.010 
but running with a chunk load on it I
left<00:02:25.550> mine<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:25.910> about<00:02:26.000> 3-4<00:02:26.540> days<00:02:26.690> come<00:02:26.990> back

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
left mine for about 3-4 days come back

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.610 
left mine for about 3-4 days come back
and<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.950> was<00:02:28.070> absolutely<00:02:28.490> fantastic<00:02:29.470> but<00:02:30.470> that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and it was absolutely fantastic but that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.960 
and it was absolutely fantastic but that
is<00:02:30.800> probably<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.160> best<00:02:31.310> way<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.490> feed<00:02:31.790> your

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
is probably the best way to feed your

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.130 
is probably the best way to feed your
hungry<00:02:32.180> node<00:02:32.860> using<00:02:34.570> applying<00:02:35.570> logistics

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
hungry node using applying logistics

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.160 
hungry node using applying logistics
very<00:02:36.680> very<00:02:37.070> simple<00:02:37.490> man<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.790> set<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.870> I'll

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
very very simple man all set and I'll

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.990 
very very simple man all set and I'll
cover<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.590> second<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.400> best<00:02:40.670> way<00:02:40.940> to

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
cover in a second the best way to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.470 
cover in a second the best way to
stabilize<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.960> as<00:02:42.080> well<00:02:43.090> okay<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.150> we've<00:02:44.450> shown

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
stabilize it as well okay so we've shown

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.130 
stabilize it as well okay so we've shown
you<00:02:44.810> how<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.940> feed<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:46.970> node<00:02:47.330> using<00:02:47.750> apply

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
you how to feed your node using apply

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.390 
you how to feed your node using apply
liner<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:48.920> now<00:02:49.100> we're<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
liner just like so now we're going to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.100 
liner just like so now we're going to
show<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.640> how<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:49.940> stabilize<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.750> using<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
show you how to stabilize it using the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.620 
show you how to stabilize it using the
exact<00:02:51.410> same<00:02:51.530> process<00:02:52.190> with<00:02:53.000> apply<00:02:53.450> they're

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
exact same process with apply they're

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.650 
exact same process with apply they're
just<00:02:53.810> expressing<00:02:55.209> formation<00:02:56.209> planes<00:02:56.390> again

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
just expressing formation planes again

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.420 
just expressing formation planes again
one<00:02:57.230> on<00:02:57.350> top<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.650> one<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> bottom<00:02:58.310> I've

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
one on top and one on the bottom I've

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
one on top and one on the bottom I've
also<00:02:58.610> got<00:02:58.850> destabilized<00:02:59.660> redstone<00:03:00.110> because

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
also got destabilized redstone because

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.090 
also got destabilized redstone because
nodes<00:03:01.550> can't<00:03:02.030> suck<00:03:02.570> up<00:03:02.840> liquids<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.680> far<00:03:03.890> as<00:03:04.010> I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
nodes can't suck up liquids as far as I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.560 
nodes can't suck up liquids as far as I
know<00:03:04.160> I've<00:03:04.520> never<00:03:04.550> had<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.120> suck<00:03:05.330> up<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
know I've never had it suck up the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.840 
know I've never had it suck up the
liquids<00:03:05.870> for<00:03:06.050> me<00:03:06.200> but<00:03:06.500> destabilize<00:03:07.430> redstone

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
liquids for me but destabilize redstone

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.160 
liquids for me but destabilize redstone
is<00:03:08.030> probably<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.390> best<00:03:08.540> way<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.080> that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
is probably the best way to go for that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.920 
is probably the best way to go for that
one<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.850> what<00:03:11.000> we<00:03:11.090> did<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:11.510> place<00:03:11.900> that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
one so what we did is we place that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.720 
one so what we did is we place that
around<00:03:12.350> but<00:03:12.560> let's<00:03:12.770> pretend<00:03:13.100> our<00:03:13.250> hungry<00:03:13.580> node

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
around but let's pretend our hungry node

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.449 
around but let's pretend our hungry node
is<00:03:13.850> in<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.000> middle<00:03:14.239> again<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.570> haven't<00:03:14.930> got<00:03:15.110> one

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
is in the middle again I haven't got one

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.310 
is in the middle again I haven't got one
but<00:03:16.459> we've<00:03:16.640> got<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.120> dense<00:03:17.390> energy<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.200> only

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
but we've got a dense energy so you only

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.990 
but we've got a dense energy so you only
have<00:03:18.500> any<00:03:18.650> one<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.010> density<00:03:19.640> cells<00:03:19.880> to

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
have any one of these density cells to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.540 
have any one of these density cells to
do<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.270> I've<00:03:20.480> never<00:03:20.510> used<00:03:20.959> more<00:03:21.500> than<00:03:21.860> I've

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
do this I've never used more than I've

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.550 
do this I've never used more than I've

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
that's or anything so we've got no

bottom with the node stabilizer cool so

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.470 
bottom with the node stabilizer cool so
we've<00:03:38.540> got<00:03:39.280> any<00:03:40.280> interface<00:03:40.730> on<00:03:40.970> here<00:03:41.299> and

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
we've got any interface on here and

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.150 
we've got any interface on here and
we've<00:03:41.570> got<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.780> stack<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.170> transducers<00:03:42.980> and

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
we've got a stack of transducers and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.310 
we've got a stack of transducers and
stabilizers<00:03:43.820> in<00:03:44.030> there<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:45.080> is<00:03:45.200> gonna

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
stabilizers in there and this is gonna

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.810 
stabilizers in there and this is gonna
help<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.680> process<00:03:45.830> so<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.670> the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
help with the process so with the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.580 
help with the process so with the

with<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.830> liquidized<00:03:49.340> it's<00:03:49.970> gonna<00:03:50.120> keep<00:03:50.360> this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
with it liquidized it's gonna keep this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.180 
with it liquidized it's gonna keep this
thing<00:03:50.690> active<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.200> time<00:03:51.290> levers<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.070> you

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
thing active all the time levers if you

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.430 
thing active all the time levers if you
pop<00:03:52.400> them<00:03:52.580> onto<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.930> block<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.320> you're

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
pop them onto the block that you're

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.479 
pop them onto the block that you're
trying<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.680> place<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:55.010> I'm<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.160> gonna<00:03:55.310> keep

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
trying to place it I'm just gonna keep

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.520 
trying to place it I'm just gonna keep
popping<00:03:55.850> off<00:03:55.970> every<00:03:56.420> time<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.989> block<00:03:57.200> at<00:03:57.410> this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
popping off every time the block at this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.140 
popping off every time the block at this
replace<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.100> put<00:03:58.310> block<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> redstone<00:03:59.120> there

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
replace you put block a redstone there

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.840 
replace you put block a redstone there
but<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> thing<00:03:59.810> might<00:04:00.140> eat<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:00.950> it's<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.700> lot

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
but the thing might eat it so it's a lot

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.250 
but the thing might eat it so it's a lot
better<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.360> use<00:04:02.480> a<00:04:02.510> liquid<00:04:02.900> but<00:04:03.019> if<00:04:03.140> you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
better just to use a liquid but if you

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.479 
better just to use a liquid but if you
see<00:04:03.440> here<00:04:03.620> we're<00:04:03.769> gonna<00:04:03.860> pop<00:04:04.070> that<00:04:04.100> one<00:04:04.370> off

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
see here we're gonna pop that one off

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.640 
see here we're gonna pop that one off
and<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:04.820> gonna<00:04:04.940> drop<00:04:05.150> down<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.660> transducer

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and it's gonna drop down and transducer

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.020 
and it's gonna drop down and transducer
every<00:04:06.920> time<00:04:07.100> we<00:04:07.190> take<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.400> off<00:04:07.549> it's<00:04:07.730> gonna<00:04:07.850> pop

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
every time we take it off it's gonna pop

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.539 
every time we take it off it's gonna pop
down<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.269> new<00:04:08.480> transducer<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:10.130> gonna<00:04:10.250> be<00:04:10.400> the

down a new transducer it's gonna be the

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.910 
down a new transducer it's gonna be the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
whole stack on this I'd probably used

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.900 
whole stack on this I'd probably used
about<00:04:20.810> most<00:04:21.560> was<00:04:21.950> fifteen<00:04:22.520> trying<00:04:22.850> to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
about most was fifteen trying to

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.100 
about most was fifteen trying to
stabilize<00:04:23.060> one<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.479> these<00:04:23.600> things<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.820> yeah

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
stabilize one of these things and yeah

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.150 
stabilize one of these things and yeah
you<00:04:27.110> ain't<00:04:27.229> used<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.620> many<00:04:27.830> I'd<00:04:28.010> probably

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
you ain't used that many I'd probably

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.190 
you ain't used that many I'd probably
say<00:04:28.460> at<00:04:28.729> least<00:04:29.000> have<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:29.390> half<00:04:29.630> a<00:04:29.780> stack<00:04:30.020> in

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
say at least have like half a stack in

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.360 
say at least have like half a stack in
there<00:04:30.350> just<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.590> be<00:04:30.680> on<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.770> very<00:04:30.950> safe<00:04:31.160> side

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
there just to be on the very safe side

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.920 
there just to be on the very safe side
but<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.669> is<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> best<00:04:32.060> way<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.210> stabilize

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
but that is the best way to stabilize

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.040 
but that is the best way to stabilize
your<00:04:33.229> angry<00:04:34.130> node

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
your angry node

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.869 
your angry node
and<00:04:35.169> once<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.620> stabilized<00:04:36.159> and<00:04:36.430> everything's

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
and once it stabilized and everything's

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.339 
and once it stabilized and everything's
in<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.240> can<00:04:37.389> remove<00:04:37.659> everything<00:04:38.050> just

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
in there you can remove everything just

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.430 
in there you can remove everything just
make<00:04:38.590> sure<00:04:39.030> when<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.449> do<00:04:40.720> remove<00:04:41.020> all<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.319> this

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
make sure when you do remove all of this

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.219 
make sure when you do remove all of this
that<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.460> have<00:04:42.490> some<00:04:43.060> sort<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.360> power<00:04:43.659> on<00:04:43.990> this

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
that you have some sort of power on this

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.320 
that you have some sort of power on this
block<00:04:44.500> here<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:44.949> if<00:04:45.009> you<00:04:45.099> wanna<00:04:45.250> take<00:04:45.460> try<00:04:46.240> and

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
block here so if you wanna take try and

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.020 
block here so if you wanna take try and
get<00:04:46.449> rid<00:04:46.539> of<00:04:46.599> your<00:04:46.780> destabilized<00:04:47.500> redstone

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
get rid of your destabilized redstone

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.070 
get rid of your destabilized redstone
just<00:04:49.030> make<00:04:49.180> sure<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.419> put<00:04:49.629> maybe<00:04:49.780> like<00:04:49.930> a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
just make sure you put maybe like a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.809 
just make sure you put maybe like a
redstone<00:04:50.440> block<00:04:50.560> on<00:04:50.979> top<00:04:51.129> of<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.400> or<00:04:51.490> something

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
redstone block on top of it or something

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.700 
redstone block on top of it or something
before<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.599> get<00:04:52.870> rid<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.259> stuff<00:04:53.500> here

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
before you get rid of this stuff here

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.249 
before you get rid of this stuff here
like<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.569> otherwise<00:04:55.569> that<00:04:55.840> will<00:04:55.960> turn

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
like that otherwise that will turn

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.629 
like that otherwise that will turn
itself<00:04:56.590> off<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:57.129> mean<00:04:57.669> it's<00:04:57.940> not<00:04:58.090> gonna<00:04:59.639> the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
itself off I mean it's not gonna the

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.790 
itself off I mean it's not gonna the
energize<00:05:01.030> itself<00:05:01.389> straightaway<00:05:02.020> but<00:05:02.080> just<00:05:02.620> to
