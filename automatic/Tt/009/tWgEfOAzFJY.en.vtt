00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.450 
flash the connectivity option when it
comes<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> network<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> provided<00:01:31.170> by<00:01:31.290> edge<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
comes to network is provided by edge so

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
comes to network is provided by edge so
you<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.850> 3G<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.630> does<00:01:33.869> support

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you don't get 3G but it does support

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
you don't get 3G but it does support
edge<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.040> Wi-Fi<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.119> have

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
edge as well as Wi-Fi so you have

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.999 
edge as well as Wi-Fi so you have
connectivity<00:01:36.869> options<00:01:36.990> plus<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.650> supports

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
connectivity options plus it supports

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
connectivity options plus it supports
two<00:01:38.189> sims<00:01:38.549> let<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.150> quickly<00:01:39.360> remove<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> back

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
two sims let me quickly remove the back

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
two sims let me quickly remove the back
cover<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.380> show<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> sims

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
cover and show you that one of the sims

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.440 
cover and show you that one of the sims
is<00:01:42.150> hot-swappable<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.939> while<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.149> sin

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
is hot-swappable so while one sin

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
is hot-swappable so while one sin
resides<00:01:45.600> under<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> battery<00:01:46.470> which<00:01:47.280> remains

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
resides under the battery which remains

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.819 
resides under the battery which remains
active<00:01:48.060> almost<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
active almost all the time you have the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
active almost all the time you have the
option<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:50.610> sim<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> right

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
option of another sim which is right

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
option of another sim which is right
here<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.439> press<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> remove<00:01:53.220> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
here so you can just press to remove it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
here so you can just press to remove it
so<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> second<00:01:54.390> swim<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> actually<00:01:55.140> hot

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so the second swim is actually hot

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.190 
so the second swim is actually hot
swappable<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> smart<00:01:57.200> call

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
swappable and there is a smart call

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
swappable and there is a smart call
forwarding<00:01:58.619> feature<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.219> while<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> put<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
forwarding feature so while you put the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
forwarding feature so while you put the
other<00:02:00.240> SIM<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> once<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.320> talking<00:02:01.619> on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
other SIM and once you are talking on

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.980 
other SIM and once you are talking on
one<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> SIM<00:02:02.280> star<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> other<00:02:03.780> one

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
one of the SIM star all on the other one

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.139 
one of the SIM star all on the other one
is<00:02:04.140> routed<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.740> previous<00:02:05.040> sim<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.939> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
is routed to your previous sim in that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.920 
is routed to your previous sim in that
case<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> don't<00:02:06.630> miss<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> rockfalls

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
case you don't miss the rockfalls

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.840 
case you don't miss the rockfalls
is<00:02:07.990> also<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.320> memory<00:02:08.800> card<00:02:08.920> slot<00:02:09.250> over<00:02:09.399> here<00:02:09.670> so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
is also a memory card slot over here so

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.480 
is also a memory card slot over here so
you<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.119> increase<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.660> memory<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.250> add

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
you can increase the memory you can add

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.420 
you can increase the memory you can add
a<00:02:12.520> memory<00:02:13.210> card<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.510> up<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.660> 32gb<00:02:14.220> interface<00:02:15.220> is

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
a memory card of up to 32gb interface is

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.280 
a memory card of up to 32gb interface is
very<00:02:15.460> similar<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.270> what<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.570> see<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.810> Android
