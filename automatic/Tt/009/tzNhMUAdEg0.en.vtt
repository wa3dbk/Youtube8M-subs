00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.849
 we are all boys and welcome to 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.830
 this new video I'm here today for 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:24.900
 to present you that two pools a are i 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.670
 kage cvx 230 dtt modding of timber 131 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
 practically then they are practically 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 of the simple the skin 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 in short, however, I have seen that he has us 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 the loader was already worked 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.329
 frontal already reached the ICI is itself 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.479
 added other particularities arranged 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 some bombs and so on and yes today 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.860
 also presented why this here black 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.879
 it's really really nice I made a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.299
 excellent an excellent reskin then I am 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.089
 almost simply the functions we say 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:02.369
 on the outside we have the possibility of 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:06.710
 approach us frontally with the r key 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:08.540
 we practically remove the console of the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 front loader 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.200
 here it is the network that is removed 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 laterally we have the possibility of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.900
 always remove the fenders with the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 r key ok is outside we always have 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.660
 the last option which is to open 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.980
 the door from the outside 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.800
 then internally the interiors are 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.490
 quite good they are very faithful like 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.030
 ici always with enter key of a pad 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.070
 don't forget the space x any more 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.620
 they are not all the vice in practice 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.160
 do it anyway as you have seen 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.610
 left door resealable plank of 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.040
 steering wheel that rises when you go down 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.580
 from the tractor rear window above here I am 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 here and vertically re between the arms of the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.830
 front linkage 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.710
 here it is, you see that they are retracting 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:15.110
 arms then later we have 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.680
 unfortunately no indoor rear window 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.780
 sound sin anyway I saw that there 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.660
 have been various versions to the eye that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.000
 they are packs that you have to extract 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 inside you find the puma and the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.110
 front loader so you need them 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 pull out even if the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 charger is the store has redone it 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.510
 has destined a little bit anyway 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.190
 practically the same we say about graham 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.680
 it's the same as another thing 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.860
 inside we have when we activate the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.010
 flashing you see that there is that dot 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:59.810
 red and green flashing on the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.800
 computerino see the arrows working 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.490
 even the symbol is the warning light here 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.370
 in the bridge 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.420
 of good functioning spies at the level 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.040
 brightness so 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.959
 almost the same as the default ones 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 same thing to do it again here 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.360
 these are always flashing lights 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.130
 the usual strength we are a power 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.120
 adjusted well enough not to 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.760
 discreetly involves how sound is 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.930
 good even if I preferred the one from 2013 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.340
 let's see the magazine for a moment 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.200
 this one is pretty much the same as it is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.540
 equal changes practically nothing like 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.450
 loader weights 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.410
 this is also excellent, you want it to be difficult 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.670
 really get up behind though 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.360
 however the camera body is bigger 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 de maybe of the 160 that there is original 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.530
 so we are already aware of the improvement 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.530
 of the weights 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.740
 in there too it is quite set 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.740
 well the room the functioning sins 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:40.199
 also known facilitates us though 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:48.499
 definitely dead loading operations 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:48.499
 I 'll throw him out not hit by the ok 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:01.370
 excellent effect loader movements e 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:05.479
 nothing is enough this this is how much yes 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.639
 let's say as I told you only about the ski king 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.050
 however , you also appreciate it because I have 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.930
 since in any case it simply does not have 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.169
 destined but already worked on us 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.080
 put his own and in any case we keep 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.729
 eye and tongue mobbing 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.880
 because they are really good year round 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.310
 last in 2013 they really churned out 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.650
 beautiful motorcycles and then you are 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.930
 really really good at it like 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.720
 you know there is still some at the beginning and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.600
 we have to settle for that a bit 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.180
 that we are given I leave you the link 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.039
 I leave you all the decision 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.600
 always watching because there are ficks 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:47.030
 continuous essays so it is likely that they will 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.800
 an accommodation is coming soon 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.770
 so keep an eye on how 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 ster no boys I leave you greet 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.500
 now we'll see if I publish something to 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.910
 end of the year I don't know if maybe between a video 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.910
 good wishes so maybe I'll talk 22 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.950
 chatter will talk a little bit about 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.190
 how is it going etc. otherwise 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.500
 see you again in January that I already have 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.900
 agricultural ready videos and everything 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.180
 so I'll always be there 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.979
 I thank you and greet you and talk to you 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.979
 very soon in the next videos, bye bye
