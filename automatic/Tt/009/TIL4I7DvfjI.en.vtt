magazine and everybody's all excited and
so<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.220> did<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.550> drawing<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.030> Thursday<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.310> my

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
so I did the drawing on Thursday and my

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.790 
so I did the drawing on Thursday and my
loophole<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.750> guess<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.320> can<00:03:48.470> call<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.740> a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
loophole I guess we can call it a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.160 
loophole I guess we can call it a
loophole<00:03:49.010> is<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:50.240> have<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.630> watch<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
loophole is that you have to watch the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.770 
loophole is that you have to watch the
video<00:03:51.440> where<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.730> drawing<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.480> see<00:03:53.660> if

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
video where I do the drawing to see if

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.650 
video where I do the drawing to see if
you're<00:03:53.960> a<00:03:53.990> winner<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.070> miss<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.660> then

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
you're a winner and if you miss it then

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.260 
you're a winner and if you miss it then
you<00:03:57.290> missed<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.710> and<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.670> has<00:03:58.850> happened

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
you missed it and this has happened

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.880 
you missed it and this has happened
every<00:03:59.630> time<00:03:59.660> I've<00:03:59.960> done<00:03:59.990> a<00:04:00.140> drawing<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.740> I

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
every time I've done a drawing and I

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830 
every time I've done a drawing and I
pull<00:04:01.250> out<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.430> winner<00:04:01.670> about<00:04:02.330> half<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.810> time

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
pull out a winner about half the time

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.530 
pull out a winner about half the time
people<00:04:03.590> don't<00:04:03.770> claim<00:04:04.010> their<00:04:04.220> prizes<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.180> I

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
people don't claim their prizes so I

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.930 
people don't claim their prizes so I
know<00:04:05.600> they're<00:04:06.020> not<00:04:06.050> paying<00:04:06.470> attention<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:07.520> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
know they're not paying attention to the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.990 
know they're not paying attention to the
video<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.500> put<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:09.920> last<00:04:10.400> time<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.910> know
