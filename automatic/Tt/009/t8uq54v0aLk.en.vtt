it's a 24 watt full-spectrum grow light

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.400 
it's a 24 watt full-spectrum grow light
and<00:00:17.919> that's<00:00:18.919> going<00:00:19.429> off<00:00:19.580> of<00:00:19.609> this<00:00:19.880> timer<00:00:20.410> if

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
and that's going off of this timer if

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.829 
and that's going off of this timer if
you<00:00:21.560> keep<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.249> quail<00:00:22.519> at<00:00:22.730> 18<00:00:23.089> hours<00:00:23.449> they

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:23.839 
you keep the the quail at 18 hours they

of light a day they will lay an egg
every<00:00:25.999> day<00:00:26.179> and<00:00:27.140> I'm<00:00:27.230> going<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.380> have<00:00:27.560> an<00:00:27.769> arrow

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
every day and I'm going to have an arrow

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.669 
every day and I'm going to have an arrow
and<00:00:28.130> two<00:00:28.249> females<00:00:28.699> on<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.150> side<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.749> a<00:00:30.470> man

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
when two females on this side I'm going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.520 
when two females on this side I'm going
to<00:00:32.689> have<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:34.040> Texas<00:00:34.880> A&amp;M<00:00:35.060> s4<00:00:35.720> white<00:00:35.870> meat<00:00:36.110> on

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
to have the Texas A&amp;M s4 white meat on

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.960 
to have the Texas A&amp;M s4 white meat on
one<00:00:36.890> side<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:39.070> thicker<00:00:40.070> neck<00:00:40.130> for<00:00:40.790> brown

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
one side and the thicker neck for brown

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.930 
one side and the thicker neck for brown
meat<00:00:41.150> on<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.390> other<00:00:41.560> got<00:00:42.560> my<00:00:42.650> incubator<00:00:43.040> I<00:00:43.610> can

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
meat on the other got my incubator I can

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.390 
meat on the other got my incubator I can
probably<00:00:44.150> put<00:00:44.450> shoot<00:00:45.170> 50<00:00:45.830> eggs<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.160> there<00:00:46.280> at<00:00:46.340> a

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
probably put shoot 50 eggs in there at a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100 
probably put shoot 50 eggs in there at a
time<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:46.610> think<00:00:46.820> as<00:00:47.120> quail<00:00:47.360> eggs<00:00:47.540> are<00:00:47.720> so<00:00:47.870> small

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
time I think as quail eggs are so small

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.380 
time I think as quail eggs are so small
and<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.070> I'm<00:00:49.160> going<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.370> grow<00:00:49.820> them<00:00:49.970> out<00:00:50.120> over

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
and then I'm going to grow them out over

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.280 
and then I'm going to grow them out over
here<00:00:50.630> put<00:00:50.810> my<00:00:50.930> chicks<00:00:51.170> over<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:52.750> only<00:00:53.750> a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
here put my chicks over here and only a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.380 
here put my chicks over here and only a
16<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.220> 20<00:00:55.490> days<00:00:55.670> they're<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.210> incubator

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
16 to 20 days they're in the incubator

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.950 
16 to 20 days they're in the incubator
and<00:00:57.020> they<00:00:57.470> come<00:00:57.710> out<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.540> size<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.900> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
and they come out up the size of a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.230 
and they come out up the size of a
bumble<00:01:00.410> bee<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.650> large<00:01:01.070> bumble<00:01:01.460> bee<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.820> little

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
bumble bee a large bumble bee a little

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.070 
bumble bee a large bumble bee a little
little<00:01:02.960> chicks<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.970> so<00:01:04.970> we're<00:01:05.840> going<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.990> be

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
little chicks and so we're going to be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.469 
little chicks and so we're going to be
pickling<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> eggs<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.280> selling<00:01:08.030> fertilized

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
pickling the eggs and selling fertilized

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.849 
pickling the eggs and selling fertilized
eggs<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.579> raising<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:12.369> birds<00:01:13.369> for<00:01:13.640> both<00:01:13.850> as

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
eggs and raising the birds for both as

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.289 
eggs and raising the birds for both as
breeding<00:01:15.859> birds<00:01:16.070> as<00:01:16.369> well<00:01:16.399> as<00:01:16.579> for<00:01:16.939> meat<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
breeding birds as well as for meat and

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.559 
breeding birds as well as for meat and
to<00:01:17.600> release<00:01:17.899> maybe<00:01:18.740> even<00:01:19.009> release<00:01:19.249> on<00:01:19.569> other

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
to release maybe even release on other

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.679 
to release maybe even release on other
property<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.859> there<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.249> go<00:01:22.460> my<00:01:22.880> coil<00:01:23.179> cage

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
property so there you go my coil cage

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.580 
property so there you go my coil cage
one<00:01:24.619> thing<00:01:24.999> they<00:01:25.999> have<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.649> site<00:01:27.649> reflex<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
one thing they have a site reflex the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.429 
one thing they have a site reflex the
you<00:01:30.590> know<00:01:30.770> for<00:01:31.719> protection<00:01:32.719> in<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.899> wild<00:01:33.289> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
you know for protection in the wild and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.919 
you know for protection in the wild and
they'll<00:01:33.530> fly<00:01:34.100> straight<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.539> you<00:01:35.600> put

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
they'll fly straight up and so you put

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.749 
they'll fly straight up and so you put
something<00:01:36.109> soft<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:36.649> put<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:36.889> towel<00:01:37.159> on<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.460> top

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
something soft I put a towel on the top

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.789 
something soft I put a towel on the top
so<00:01:37.969> they<00:01:38.090> don't<00:01:38.240> break<00:01:39.079> their<00:01:39.319> necks<00:01:39.560> when

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
so they don't break their necks when

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.489 
so they don't break their necks when
they<00:01:39.889> fly<00:01:40.100> straight<00:01:40.399> up<00:01:40.429> but<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.289> you<00:01:42.350> go

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
they fly straight up but so there you go

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.559 
they fly straight up but so there you go
we<00:01:42.710> need<00:01:42.859> something<00:01:43.249> soft<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.939> light<00:01:44.389> on<00:01:44.539> a

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
we need something soft a light on a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.969 
we need something soft a light on a
timer<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:46.369> quail<00:01:46.700> are<00:01:47.229> more<00:01:48.229> efficient

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
timer and the quail are more efficient

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.649 
timer and the quail are more efficient
than<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.219> chicken<00:01:49.490> as<00:01:49.819> far<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:50.359> the<00:01:50.479> ratio

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
than a chicken as far as the ratio

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.959 
than a chicken as far as the ratio
between<00:01:50.899> feed<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.979> how<00:01:52.159> much<00:01:52.340> meat<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.729> eggs

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
between feed and how much meat and eggs

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.719 
between feed and how much meat and eggs
you<00:01:53.179> get<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> go<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.310> I'll<00:01:55.459> let<00:01:55.609> you

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
you get so there you go and I'll let you

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.159 
you get so there you go and I'll let you
know<00:01:55.759> how<00:01:56.439> pickled<00:01:57.439> quail<00:01:57.560> eggs<00:01:57.859> taste
