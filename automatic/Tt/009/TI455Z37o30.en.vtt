00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.500
 In 1977. 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.620
 a signal was received 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.580
 It is the only recorded incident of alien contact. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.400
 The source of the transmission has never been revealed. 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.100
 Until now. 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.180
 Ohhh !! 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.300
 Is that it? 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.560
 No, it's another spacecraft that fell from heaven, stupid 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.820
 Daddy likes it;) 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 what else is in it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.660
 There's a tractor on it, but it doesn't do anything. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.020
 Where's my phone?! I have to make a vine 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.540
 Conflict is coming. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.800
 But we need your help. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 I think it gave me a loss of memory 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.840
 Anesthesia 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.120
 Shut up dude. you are stupid. I'm out of here. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
 You expect me to train these idiots! 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.000
 Get lost. I know what I am doing. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.480
 Let's crank this baby to the hundred: D 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.820
 next one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 The repulser defensive glove produces an energy shield 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420
 Yes. I just have a quick question before we start. How exactly .... 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.020
 Ohawwgh! with other weird noises 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.040
 your new uniforms. 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.900
 They are not anti-flammable 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.040
 They are highly flammable. 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.960
 They will not slow flames. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.600
 Are you expecting to catch us on fire? 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 Oh! 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.220
 I have to go. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.780
 This alien is here within 2 days 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.540
 If we are not there to fight it, who will? 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 Are you on my side? 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.580
 Not really! 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.180
 What are you doing? 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.640
 I have a beer. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 I just walked for three miles. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.800
 Yes, like a quarter of a mile at a time. 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.520
 Woooohoo! 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 They are actually working together. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.540
 If anything comes up to you, I'll ... block it. 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.440
 Why the hell are we Lazer Team? 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.460
 Because I have a laser. 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.760
 Yes. But not the rest of us. 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.860
 Right. You are the team part. 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500
 Nobody cares about your stupid name. 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280
 The helmet increases all mental functions. 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.760
 And other visual improvements. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 Boys. 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.720
 What is your problem? 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.900
 Oh! Shut it down! Oh God! I wish I was dead!
