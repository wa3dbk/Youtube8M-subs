00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
you're doing this and then pay attention

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.130 
you're doing this and then pay attention
to<00:03:32.820> what<00:03:33.150> you're<00:03:33.300> doing<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.780> get<00:03:33.930> bit

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
to what you're doing when you get bit

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.380 
to what you're doing when you get bit
and<00:03:34.320> when<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.560> get<00:03:34.740> bit<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:36.030> know<00:03:36.180> what

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and when you get bit then you know what

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690 
and when you get bit then you know what
to<00:03:36.510> look<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.900> our<00:03:37.560> problem<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.130> most<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.490> time

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
to look for our problem is most of time

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.100 
to look for our problem is most of time
we're<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:38.880> paying<00:03:39.209> attention<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.720> get<00:03:39.870> bit

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
we're not paying attention we get bit

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.420 
we're not paying attention we get bit
and<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.410> don't<00:03:40.560> know<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.830> we<00:03:40.920> were<00:03:41.070> doing<00:03:41.220> at

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
and we don't know what we were doing at

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.400 
and we don't know what we were doing at
the<00:03:41.459> exact<00:03:41.820> same<00:03:42.030> moment<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.050> back<00:03:43.230> and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the exact same moment to go back and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.780 
the exact same moment to go back and
duplicate<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.100> then<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> got<00:03:44.520> an<00:03:44.640> issue

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
duplicate that and then you got an issue

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.510 
duplicate that and then you got an issue
but<00:03:45.780> once<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.320> do<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.920> duplicate

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
but once you can do that and duplicate

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.160 
but once you can do that and duplicate
it<00:03:47.550> then<00:03:48.000> you've<00:03:48.150> got<00:03:48.300> somewhat<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> pattern

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
it then you've got somewhat of a pattern

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.240 
it then you've got somewhat of a pattern
you<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.380> what<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.590> look<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.130> can

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
you know what to look for and you can

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.220 
you know what to look for and you can
take<00:03:50.430> off<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.760> go<00:03:50.880> with<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:52.020> lot<00:03:52.200> of

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
take off and go with it and a lot of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.230 
take off and go with it and a lot of
times<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> day<00:03:53.250> like<00:03:53.280> today<00:03:53.490> when<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.060> so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
times on a day like today when it's so

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.060 
times on a day like today when it's so
bright<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.510> clear<00:03:54.870> out<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:55.830> go

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
bright and clear out you can just go

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.830 
bright and clear out you can just go
down<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.700> run<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.910> shady<00:03:57.209> banks<00:03:57.660> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
down and just run a shady banks and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.440 
down and just run a shady banks and
catch<00:03:58.230> fish<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.670> just<00:03:59.880> got<00:04:00.000> explore<00:04:00.330> your

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
catch fish so you just got explore your

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.610 
catch fish so you just got explore your
options<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.080> then<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.590> from

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
options there and then take it from

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.020 
options there and then take it from
there<00:04:01.920> once<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.190> get<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.730> figure<00:04:02.940> out

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
there once you get bit to figure out

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.330 
there once you get bit to figure out
what<00:04:03.150> they're<00:04:03.300> doing
