letters<00:04:49.560> tetricus<00:04:51.510> survived<00:04:52.510> quite<00:04:52.810> well<00:04:53.110> at

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
letters tetricus survived quite well at

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:01.080 
letters tetricus survived quite well at
their<00:04:55.620> second<00:04:56.620> coin<00:04:57.570> was<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:59.580> Julia<00:05:00.580> maser<00:05:00.850> I

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
their second coin was a Julia maser I

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.940 
their second coin was a Julia maser I
believe<00:05:01.510> very<00:05:01.990> difficult<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.500> work<00:05:02.620> out<00:05:02.890> but

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
believe very difficult to work out but

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.890 
believe very difficult to work out but
there's<00:05:03.400> quite<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.669> pronounced<00:05:04.180> bust<00:05:04.419> on<00:05:04.660> there

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
silver Denarius possibly can see there's

days but I just shoved it in my back
pocket<00:06:30.650> it<00:06:31.339> was<00:06:31.490> getting<00:06:31.789> dark<00:06:31.999> I<00:06:32.270> thought<00:06:32.659> I

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
pocket it was getting dark I thought I

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.860 
pocket it was getting dark I thought I
was<00:06:33.259> like<00:06:33.379> a<00:06:33.409> copper<00:06:33.770> penny<00:06:34.039> but<00:06:34.629> when<00:06:35.629> I<00:06:35.659> got

him back I realized that it was a bit

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.659 
him back I realized that it was a bit
more<00:06:38.529> significant<00:06:39.529> than<00:06:39.650> that<00:06:39.889> as<00:06:40.430> you<00:06:40.550> can

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
more significant than that as you can

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.089 
more significant than that as you can
sing<00:06:40.909> it's<00:06:41.089> um<00:06:42.219> it's<00:06:43.219> a<00:06:43.339> pop<00:06:43.580> it<00:06:43.729> over<00:06:43.849> a<00:06:44.000> mani

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
type with a TR below which is not sure I

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.689 
type with a TR below which is not sure I
don't<00:06:51.139> think<00:06:51.349> that's<00:06:51.500> trigger<00:06:51.889> because<00:06:52.219> some

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699 
don't think that's trigger because some

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.350 
don't think that's trigger because some
the<00:06:53.419> sitacles<00:06:53.899> from<00:06:54.550> was<00:06:55.550> from<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:55.819> trio<00:06:56.120> min

it's a big piece and I think makes a

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:23.139 
it's a big piece and I think makes a
nice<00:07:21.770> ring<00:07:22.069> when<00:07:22.219> you<00:07:22.310> put<00:07:22.460> it<00:07:22.550> down<00:07:22.729> as<00:07:22.939> well

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:23.149 
nice ring when you put it down as well

but i'm afraid that beats the silica for
a<00:07:27.199> condition<00:07:27.710> and<00:07:27.979> possibly<00:07:28.729> rarity<00:07:31.719> thank
