00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 nature has been tamed ski slopes 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.040
 draw paved roads 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.670
 lifts installed welcome 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.170
 in the games of the excess laps of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 time was very short to build 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 to build such stations 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.590
 this one with all you need 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.630
 the infrastructure needed for 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.289
 we are two beautiful tracks for 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 Olympic Games 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.869
 these are the young and more expensive of 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.420
 the history of Olympism 37 billion 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 EUR for infrastructure 26 times 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.660
 more than the previous winter games at 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.649
 vancouver 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 because we had to start from a sheet 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.480
 white build 11 Olympic venues 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.540
 spread over 50 km between the mountain and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 the coastal zone six years of work and a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.010
 huge sense of pride 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 it's amazing I think all the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.489
 world will see like billiards because 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.270
 it's the most beautiful place in the world 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.289
 today 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.250
 of course I'm proud of it because 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.920
 figures give vertigo 367 km from 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 route 77 for an airport 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.439
 two new stations over 70 thousand 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.780
 workers were requisitioned for 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.210
 the work the ungodly because all this has 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 been created from nothing like the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.049
 rosa khutor station looks like a 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.670
 puppet theater it will be the heart 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.670
 games of alpine disciplines 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.180
 everything that is built today 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.119
 sports venues and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.939
 infrastructure but also the 24000 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.820
 hotel room all this will be operated 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.940
 the Olympic Games believe me it's a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.970
 eric sansonny difficult to oppose 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.770
 this scroll roller then rare are 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 those who dare to raise our voices we live 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 far from the games in real 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.770
 reserves will keep us from moving 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.740
 our only goal is to survive 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 during the giro after we will see 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.679
 then 6 the 6,000 athletes arrive at 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.429
 Sochi 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.440
 the games start on Friday despite 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.100
 infrastructure and preparations 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.560
 for games 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.000
 the Russian organizing committee recognizes 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.920
 than more than three hundred thousand tickets 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.569
 have not been sold yet 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.600
 the cio begin to worry about the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.920
 empty seat syndrome it's I could 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 do not fill up with spectators
