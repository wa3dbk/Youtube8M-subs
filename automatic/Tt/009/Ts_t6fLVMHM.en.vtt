00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
need okay five inches i think what they

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.580 
need okay five inches i think what they
are<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.530> they<00:02:54.040> are<00:02:54.070> tension<00:02:55.030> springs<00:02:55.590> not

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
are and they are tension springs not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.360 
are and they are tension springs not
recoil<00:02:56.950> springs<00:02:57.989> tension<00:02:58.989> springs<00:02:59.370> tensions

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
recoil springs tension springs tensions

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.060 
recoil springs tension springs tensions
vs<00:03:00.670> rico<00:03:00.910> recoil<00:03:01.570> they're<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.560> tight<00:03:02.829> and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
vs rico recoil they're really tight and

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.259 
vs rico recoil they're really tight and
you<00:03:04.000> plot<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:04.690> snap<00:03:04.930> back<00:03:05.170> these<00:03:05.769> are

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you plot and they snap back these are

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.400 
you plot and they snap back these are
spread<00:03:07.269> out<00:03:07.299> like<00:03:07.660> kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.380> pin<00:03:09.150> spring<00:03:10.410> but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
spread out like kind of a pin spring but

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.569 
spread out like kind of a pin spring but
there<00:03:12.180> may<00:03:13.180> be<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.420> may<00:03:13.450> be<00:03:14.010> dollar<00:03:15.010> piece<00:03:15.280> you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
there may be it may be dollar piece you

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.539 
there may be it may be dollar piece you

like that so but as you can see it does
not<00:04:26.500> interfere<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> functionality<00:04:28.760> of

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
not interfere with the functionality of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.300 
not interfere with the functionality of
said<00:04:30.320> weapon<00:04:30.650> okay<00:04:32.410> once<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.530> pop<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.100> screw

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
said weapon okay once you pop the screw

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.130 
said weapon okay once you pop the screw
out<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.520> here<00:04:34.790> pop<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.419> back<00:04:35.630> out<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.050> you

out of here pop this back out but you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.770 
out of here pop this back out but you
spring<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.530> put<00:04:36.650> that<00:04:36.740> piece<00:04:36.860> back<00:04:37.070> on<00:04:37.780> it

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
spring and put that piece back on it

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.770 
spring and put that piece back on it
will<00:04:39.460> fit<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.490> function<00:04:40.850> okay<00:04:41.540> so<00:04:42.230> that's<00:04:43.780> with

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
will fit a function okay so that's with

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.380 
will fit a function okay so that's with
that<00:04:44.960> laser<00:04:45.220> okay<00:04:46.220> see<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> screws

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
that laser okay see the screws

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.250 
that laser okay see the screws
everything<00:04:47.810> nice<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.080> clean<00:04:48.490> all<00:04:49.490> right<00:04:50.260> then

everything nice and clean all right then

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.940 
everything nice and clean all right then
you<00:04:51.410> got<00:04:51.620> with<00:04:52.310> laser<00:04:52.640> all<00:04:53.419> right<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:54.560> can<00:04:54.620> see

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
you got with laser all right you can see

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.870 
you got with laser all right you can see
with<00:04:55.640> laser<00:04:55.880> is<00:04:56.150> fully<00:04:56.390> functional<00:04:56.710> all<00:04:57.710> right

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
with laser is fully functional all right

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.550 
with laser is fully functional all right
this<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.910> actually<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.300> little<00:04:59.479> stiffer<00:04:59.930> than

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
this is actually a little stiffer than

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800 
this is actually a little stiffer than
the<00:05:00.620> other<00:05:00.800> one<00:05:01.180> but<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.300> can<00:05:02.419> see<00:05:02.540> it's<00:05:02.660> both
