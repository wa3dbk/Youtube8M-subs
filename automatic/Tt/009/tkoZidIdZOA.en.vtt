00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this bald pate on which is silicon and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.069

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
gone straight to the hair we glued it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
gone straight to the hair we glued it
down<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:40.170> much<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.739> part<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> onto

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
of that we've put a forehead piece which

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
of that we've put a forehead piece which
comes<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> goes<00:00:50.190> around<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
comes down to there it goes around and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
comes down to there it goes around and
that<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> pro<00:00:52.110> pondo<00:00:52.500> transfer<00:00:53.100> forehead

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
that is a pro pondo transfer forehead
piece<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.539> raise<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:54.870> eyebrows

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
piece so we just raise your eyebrows

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.819 
piece so we just raise your eyebrows
deep<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.350> defines<00:00:58.620> his

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
deep so just it just defines his

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
deep so just it just defines his
wrinkles<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> lot<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.730> actually<00:01:00.680> this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
wrinkles a lot more it's actually this

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
wrinkles a lot more it's actually this
it<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.370> very<00:01:02.699> fine<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> two

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

it it's very fine it's about one to two
mil<00:01:04.140> thick<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> blends<00:01:06.060> off<00:01:06.210> beautifully

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
mil thick and it blends off beautifully

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.320 
mil thick and it blends off beautifully
it's<00:01:07.680> such<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.010> easy<00:01:08.159> piece<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.670> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's such an easy piece to go on then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's such an easy piece to go on then
we've<00:01:09.450> done<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> old-age<00:01:09.869> stipple<00:01:10.080> around

the eyes
we<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:13.979> PP<00:01:14.760> eyes<00:01:14.909> although<00:01:15.689> stipple

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

we actually use PP eyes although stipple
in<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> case<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.759> we've<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.060> silicon

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
in this case and then we've got silicon

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.090 
in this case and then we've got silicon
transfer<00:01:19.409> eye<00:01:19.710> bags<00:01:20.100> underneath<00:01:25.100> yeah

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they're in capstone and they're really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.819

exactly<00:01:32.189> same<00:01:32.369> situation<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> pro<00:01:33.509> bondo

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
exactly same situation was the pro bondo

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.010 
exactly same situation was the pro bondo
transpires<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.090> put<00:01:36.299> those<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
transpires but you just put those on the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
transpires but you just put those on the
back<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> piece<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> put<00:01:38.549> project<00:01:38.939> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
back of a piece and you put project on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
back of a piece and you put project on
the<00:01:39.119> skin<00:01:39.590> put<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.829> gently<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.549> rotate<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the skin put it on gently just rotate a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
the skin put it on gently just rotate a
bit<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> movement<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> mold<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.520> so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bit of movement into the mold and so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.460 
bit of movement into the mold and so
then<00:01:45.180> peel<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
then peel them all the way and that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
then peel them all the way and that
leaves<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> piece<00:01:47.009> under<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> eye<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.390> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
leaves the piece under the eye and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
leaves the piece under the eye and then
we<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.720> got<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:48.990> tiny<00:01:49.409> little<00:01:49.500> crow's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we have got these tiny little crow's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
we have got these tiny little crow's
feet<00:01:50.390> pieces<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:52.079> Pro<00:01:52.259> pondo<00:01:52.649> which

feet pieces here in Pro pondo which
they're<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.130> really<00:01:53.549> subtle<00:01:53.759> very<00:01:54.299> very

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
they're really really subtle very very

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.929 
they're really really subtle very very
thin<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:55.590> thinner<00:01:55.770> than<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
thin but a much thinner than this all it

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.190 
thin but a much thinner than this all it
is<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.719> strips

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
is is just so in strips

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
is is just so in strips
a<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:59.039> attention<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> their<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.850> than

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
a bit attention to their more than

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040 
used was the silver and we just combed

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.510 
used was the silver and we just combed
that<00:07:26.220> through<00:07:26.460> with<00:07:26.640> a<00:07:26.669> mascara<00:07:27.270> brush

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
that through with a mascara brush

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.250 
that through with a mascara brush
through<00:07:29.520> his<00:07:29.640> eyebrows<00:07:30.060> just<00:07:30.360> and<00:07:30.840> we<00:07:31.050> use<00:07:31.169> the

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260 
through his eyebrows just and we use the

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.930 
through his eyebrows just and we use the
silver<00:07:31.560> as<00:07:31.860> well<00:07:32.070> because<00:07:32.370> if<00:07:32.490> you<00:07:32.550> put<00:07:32.730> white

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
silver as well because if you put white

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.570 
silver as well because if you put white
into<00:07:33.300> dark<00:07:33.510> hair<00:07:33.750> on<00:07:34.080> camera<00:07:34.620> it<00:07:35.130> really<00:07:35.340> picks

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
into dark hair on camera it really picks

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.000 
into dark hair on camera it really picks
out<00:07:35.790> as<00:07:35.940> a<00:07:35.970> blue<00:07:36.470> but<00:07:37.470> in<00:07:37.560> this<00:07:37.620> case<00:07:37.800> we<00:07:37.919> use

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.010 
out as a blue but in this case we use

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.200 
out as a blue but in this case we use
silver<00:07:38.370> because<00:07:38.550> it<00:07:38.669> does<00:07:38.790> ping<00:07:39.030> back<00:07:39.180> a

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.210 
silver because it does ping back a

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.570
