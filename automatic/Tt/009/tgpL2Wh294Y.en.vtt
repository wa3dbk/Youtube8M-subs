white thing is a cuttlebone I get it in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.380 
white thing is a cuttlebone I get it in
a<00:00:42.690> bird<00:00:43.379> section<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.550> pet<00:00:44.760> store<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> it's

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
for calcium it kind of just like

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.540 
for calcium it kind of just like

good<00:00:54.800> curious<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.699> oats<00:00:56.910> sister<00:00:57.920> but

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
good curious in the oats sister but

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
good curious in the oats sister but
that's<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> Basking<00:00:59.969> rock<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> had<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's the Basking rock that I had I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.619 
that's the Basking rock that I had I
guess<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> stinks<00:01:02.100> potlucks<00:01:02.730> don't<00:01:03.239> really

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
guess that stinks potlucks don't really

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
guess that stinks potlucks don't really
bass<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> try<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
bass that much but you do have to try to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.000 
bass that much but you do have to try to
give<00:01:06.540> them<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.869> area<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
give them the area to get out of the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
give them the area to get out of the
water<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.540> might<00:01:09.960> not

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
water but they you probably might not

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
water but they you probably might not
see<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> water<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.180> all

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
see it even get out of the water at all

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
see it even get out of the water at all
I<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.049> fir<00:01:16.320> filter<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
I just have this fir filter for the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210 
I just have this fir filter for the
little<00:01:17.280> guys<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.439> end<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.799> keeping

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
little guys but if you do end up keeping

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.469 
little guys but if you do end up keeping
them<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:21.200> good<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.439> rule<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> thumb<00:01:23.479> with

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
them a good a good rule of thumb with

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.960 
them a good a good rule of thumb with
turtles<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.820> triple<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
turtles is that you want triple the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.649 
turtles is that you want triple the
filtration<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.040> said<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.509> was

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
filtration so if it said that it was

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
filtration so if it said that it was
good<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:32.030> like<00:01:33.030> 90<00:01:33.500> gallons<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.680> water<00:01:34.920> then

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
good for like 90 gallons of water then

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.300 
good for like 90 gallons of water then
you<00:01:35.460> could<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> 30<00:01:36.329> gallon<00:01:37.009> tank<00:01:38.009> for

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you could have like a 30 gallon tank for

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.300 
you could have like a 30 gallon tank for
them<00:01:38.460> although<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> guess<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.990> um<00:01:40.310> musk

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
them although I guess them up um musk

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.899 
them although I guess them up um musk
ones<00:01:41.640> since<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.840> shallow<00:01:43.170> water<00:01:43.909> then

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
ones since they like shallow water then

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
ones since they like shallow water then
I<00:01:45.360> don't<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.130> you'd<00:01:47.310> have

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I don't know I'm really now you'd have

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
I don't know I'm really now you'd have
to<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> measure<00:01:48.390> out<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to kind of measure out if I have the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.880 
to kind of measure out if I have the
little<00:01:50.880> guy<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.390> probably<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.740> water

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
little guy I probably want the water

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880 
little guy I probably want the water
level<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
level to be like up to here and this is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.410 
level to be like up to here and this is
a<00:01:56.040> 10<00:01:56.340> gallon<00:01:56.549> tank<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.630> small

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
a 10 gallon tank so it's really small

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
a 10 gallon tank so it's really small
but<00:02:00.590> again<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:02.100> keep<00:02:02.280> getting<00:02:02.399> close<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
but again they keep getting close to

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.040 
but again they keep getting close to
make<00:02:03.290> area<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:07.160> my<00:02:08.330> water<00:02:09.330> heater<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.869> can

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
make area and my water heater you can

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.910 
make area and my water heater you can
see<00:02:10.259> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
see is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.320 
see is
that's<00:02:11.250> kind<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> water<00:02:12.000> heater

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
that's kind of what the water heater

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.400 
that's kind of what the water heater
looks<00:02:12.630> like<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.819> one<00:02:15.150> glass<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
looks like that I have this one glass I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650 
looks like that I have this one glass I
don't<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.920> what<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> difference<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.450> I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
don't know what the difference is I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.839 
don't know what the difference is I
don't<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:22.340> like<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.700> these

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
don't really know but like for these

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
because this is 30 gallon I have this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.710 
because this is 30 gallon I have this
fluval<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.950> triple<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.480> says

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
fluval it's like triple I think it says

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.220 
fluval it's like triple I think it says
like<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.430> 400<00:02:38.430> or<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:39.209> remember<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:40.050> many

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
like it's 400 or I remember how many

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.360 
like it's 400 or I remember how many
gallons<00:02:40.730> 100<00:02:41.730> gallons<00:02:42.030> i<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> filters

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
gallons 100 gallons i think it filters

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.979 
gallons 100 gallons i think it filters
so<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.940> good<00:02:45.150> triple<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.810> that's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
so then that's a good triple and that's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.330 
so then that's a good triple and that's
why<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.410> staying<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.160> clear<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:49.049> since<00:02:49.890> most

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
why it's staying so clear and since most

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.880 
why it's staying so clear and since most
turtles<00:02:50.880> don't<00:02:51.120> bass<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.440> much<00:02:52.680> they

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
turtles don't bass that much they

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.270 
turtles don't bass that much they
probably<00:02:53.100> need<00:02:53.489> super<00:02:54.120> clean<00:02:55.010> water<00:02:56.010> i'm

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
probably need super clean water i'm

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
probably need super clean water i'm
guessing<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:59.420> yeah<00:03:00.420> i<00:03:00.450> read<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:02.810> what<00:03:03.810> they

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
guessing but yeah i read for what they

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.530 
guessing but yeah i read for what they
eat<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.319> like<00:03:04.530> blood<00:03:05.010> worms<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:06.180> thing<00:03:06.390> that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
eat they like blood worms one thing that

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.460

i<00:03:06.569> read<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> i<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.709> eat<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:09.450> i<00:03:09.810> have
