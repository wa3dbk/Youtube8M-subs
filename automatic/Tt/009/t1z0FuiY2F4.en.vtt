hands through my hair and obviously
that's<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.880> weird

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.170 

but<00:02:04.500> getting<00:02:05.500> up<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:06.009> know<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.820> kind<00:02:07.030> of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
but getting up I know this is kind of

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.850 
but getting up I know this is kind of
random<00:02:07.689> because<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.229> didn't<00:02:08.530> tell<00:02:08.679> anyone

concrete so I'm glad I did what I did
and<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.550> first<00:02:27.790> part<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.180> video<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.540> was

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and the first part of this video I was

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.949 
and the first part of this video I was
kind<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.849> depressed<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.420> my<00:02:31.510> decision<00:02:32.019> but<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
kind of depressed on my decision but I

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.720 
kind of depressed on my decision but I
felt<00:02:34.959> like<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.380> was<00:02:35.500> necessary<00:02:36.100> because<00:02:36.489> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
felt like it was necessary because I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.120 
felt like it was necessary because I
want<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.060> change<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.590> hopped<00:02:38.890> on<00:02:39.100> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
want to change and I hopped on that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.660 
want to change and I hopped on that
decision<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:41.260> feel<00:02:41.680> really<00:02:42.280> really<00:02:42.430> good

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
decision and I feel really really good

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.090 
decision and I feel really really good
actually<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.360> feel<00:02:43.780> like<00:02:45.150> I'm<00:02:46.150> making<00:02:46.420> changes
