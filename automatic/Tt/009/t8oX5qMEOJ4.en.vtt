can<00:00:42.040> only<00:00:42.190> get<00:00:42.340> them<00:00:42.460> once<00:00:42.790> per<00:00:43.120> game<00:00:43.149> pack<00:00:43.570> who

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
can only get them once per game pack who

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.380 
can only get them once per game pack who
thought<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.559> was<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.039> good<00:00:45.280> idea<00:00:45.430> so

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
thought that was a good idea so

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.350 
thought that was a good idea so
basically<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.920> only<00:00:47.950> replay<00:00:48.670> value<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:49.329> have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
basically the only replay value you have

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.660 
basically the only replay value you have
was<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.260> get<00:00:50.410> some<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.710> these<00:00:50.800> special<00:00:51.070> items

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
was to get some of these special items

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.510 
was to get some of these special items
such<00:00:52.180> as<00:00:52.210> those<00:00:52.539> moves<00:00:52.840> or<00:00:53.320> those<00:00:53.770> special

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
such as those moves or those special

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.510 
such as those moves or those special
attachments<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.890> can<00:00:57.070> only<00:00:57.190> get<00:00:57.340> them

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
attachments and you can only get them

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.020 
attachments and you can only get them
once<00:00:57.730> per<00:00:57.969> game<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:59.489> what<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.579> heck<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
once per game so what the heck is the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.400 
once per game so what the heck is the
point<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.390> replaying<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.899> game<00:01:01.930> again

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
point in replaying the game again

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.040 
point in replaying the game again
secondly<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.789> online<00:01:04.089> mode<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.600> was<00:01:04.780> talking

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050

I'm<00:03:38.830> very<00:03:38.860> disappointed<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.910> game<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
I'm very disappointed with this game and

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.600 
I'm very disappointed with this game and
I<00:03:41.380> really<00:03:41.650> can't<00:03:41.860> say<00:03:42.070> anything<00:03:42.100> good<00:03:42.520> about

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
I really can't say anything good about

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.410 
I really can't say anything good about
it<00:03:42.880> except<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.080> not<00:03:44.230> broken

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it except that it's not broken

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.940 
it except that it's not broken
but<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.450> find<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.020> be<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.230> worst<00:03:47.440> one<00:03:47.740> in<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
but I find it to be the worst one in the

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.040 
but I find it to be the worst one in the
entire<00:03:48.340> series<00:03:49.210> of<00:03:49.270> where<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.600> bring<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.930> to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
entire series of where you bring it to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.480 
entire series of where you bring it to
the<00:03:50.170> home<00:03:50.470> console<00:03:51.720> yeah<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.860> personally

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
the home console yeah I I personally

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.550 
the home console yeah I I personally
think<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.790> Coliseum<00:03:55.420> was<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.690> best<00:03:55.900> one<00:03:56.200> and

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
think that Coliseum was the best one and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.980 
think that Coliseum was the best one and
this<00:03:57.220> one's<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.550> worst<00:03:57.790> because<00:03:58.690> all<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
this one's the worst because all the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.949 
this one's the worst because all the
special<00:03:59.380> features<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.830> can<00:03:59.980> only<00:04:00.190> do<00:04:00.370> once

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
special features you can only do once

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.630 
special features you can only do once
there<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.140> isn't<00:04:02.410> all<00:04:02.650> day<00:04:02.830> what<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.430> say

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
there really isn't all day what you say

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.570 
there really isn't all day what you say
about<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:04.230> that's<00:04:05.230> why<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:05.620> giving<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:06.010> a<00:04:06.190> 2

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
about it that's why I'm giving it a 2

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.270 
about it that's why I'm giving it a 2
out<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.790> 5<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.870> idea<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:08.350> there<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.040> not<00:04:09.220> a

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
out of 5 the idea was there but not a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.750 
out of 5 the idea was there but not a
lot<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.489> effort<00:04:09.760> was<00:04:10.060> put<00:04:10.120> into<00:04:10.480> it
