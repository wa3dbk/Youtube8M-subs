00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
different look for a BMW personally I

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.430 
different look for a BMW personally I
like<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.899> rid<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.229> lot<00:01:34.410> of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
like it I think it got rid of a lot of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.190 
like it I think it got rid of a lot of
the<00:01:34.680> flame<00:01:35.310> surfacing<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.240> past<00:01:36.479> which

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the flame surfacing from the past which

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350 
the flame surfacing from the past which
let's<00:01:37.530> face<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:37.830> not<00:01:38.070> many<00:01:38.220> people<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
let's face it not many people like and I

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
let's face it not many people like and I
think<00:01:39.539> this<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.810> aggressive<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.440> think<00:01:40.619> it's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
think this is aggressive I think it's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.700 
think this is aggressive I think it's
new<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:42.300> may<00:01:42.420> notice<00:01:42.630> also<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
new and you may notice also that the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
new and you may notice also that the
hood<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.820> higher<00:01:45.240> than<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.840> been

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hood is actually higher than it's been

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
hood is actually higher than it's been
in<00:01:46.049> years<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.530> there's<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> reason<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
in years and there's a reason for that

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270 
in years and there's a reason for that
European<00:01:48.420> pedestrian<00:01:49.229> safety<00:01:49.470> standards

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
European pedestrian safety standards

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
European pedestrian safety standards
require<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.119> higher<00:01:51.720> hood<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.920> run

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
require a higher hood so when you run

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.499 
require a higher hood so when you run
over<00:01:53.310> somebody<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.970> hit<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.330> hood

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
over somebody and they hit the hood

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.380 
over somebody and they hit the hood
there's<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.080> little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> space<00:01:55.829> between

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
there's a little bit of space between

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.450 
there's a little bit of space between
the<00:01:57.390> top<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> hood<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.740> engine<00:01:59.189> so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the top of the hood and the engine so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.080 
the top of the hood and the engine so
they<00:01:59.579> might<00:01:59.729> survive

what<00:04:25.470> consider<00:04:25.919> now<00:04:26.070> how<00:04:26.100> we<00:04:26.370> are<00:04:26.460> that's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
what consider now how we are that's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.700 
what consider now how we are that's
pretty<00:04:27.300> good<00:04:29.600> he<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.810> not<00:04:31.050> impressed<00:04:31.350> dude<00:04:31.530> you

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
pretty good he is not impressed dude you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.920 
pretty good he is not impressed dude you
have<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.950> get<00:04:32.130> on<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.910> track<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.210> go<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.810> up

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
have to get on the track and go like up

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.770 
have to get on the track and go like up
to<00:04:33.990> 0<00:04:34.350> to<00:04:34.530> 120<00:04:35.310> then<00:04:35.490> with<00:04:36.090> any<00:04:36.240> price<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.510> is

so<00:04:40.979> Nathan<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.639> had<00:04:41.820> this<00:04:41.940> great<00:04:42.180> idea<00:04:42.240> to

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
so Nathan and I had this great idea to

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.360 
so Nathan and I had this great idea to
do<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.110> Father's<00:04:43.470> Day<00:04:43.500> video<00:04:43.740> featuring

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
do a Father's Day video featuring

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.060 
do a Father's Day video featuring
Nathan's<00:04:44.880> little<00:04:45.150> boy<00:04:45.650> of<00:04:46.650> course

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
Nathan's little boy of course

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.029 
Nathan's little boy of course
Layton's<00:04:47.490> little<00:04:47.729> boy<00:04:47.880> Ezra<00:04:48.650> had<00:04:49.650> different

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
Layton's little boy Ezra had different

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.879 
Layton's little boy Ezra had different
plan<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:51.270> as<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.930> can<00:04:52.050> tell<00:04:52.289> we're<00:04:52.680> doing

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
plan and so as you can tell we're doing

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.629 
plan and so as you can tell we're doing
the<00:04:52.979> best<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.280> we<00:04:53.400> can

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.010 

there's<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.699> reason<00:04:56.940> why<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.300> benchmark<00:04:57.870> has

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
there's a reason why the benchmark has

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.080 
there's a reason why the benchmark has
always<00:04:58.229> been<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.650> 3<00:04:58.889> Series<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.850> always

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
always been the 3 Series it's always

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.029 
always been the 3 Series it's always
been<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.330> really<00:05:01.110> good<00:05:01.440> car<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.830> it's

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
been a really really good car and it's

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.670 
been a really really good car and it's
above<00:05:02.370> your<00:05:03.000> average<00:05:03.419> car<00:05:03.720> where<00:05:04.289> if<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.500> can

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
above your average car where if you can

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.680 
above your average car where if you can
be<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.160> maybe<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.270> Audi

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
be with it maybe the Audi

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.050 
be with it maybe the Audi
maybe<00:05:08.290> something<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.130> Lexus<00:05:09.610> builds<00:05:09.970> but

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
maybe something that Lexus builds but

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.970 
maybe something that Lexus builds but
for<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.450> most<00:05:10.600> part<00:05:10.750> really<00:05:11.470> it's<00:05:11.590> in<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:11.770> class

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
for the most part really it's in a class

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.850 
for the most part really it's in a class
of<00:05:12.160> one<00:05:12.690> ramen<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.870> both<00:05:14.110> agree<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
of one ramen and I both agree that the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.140 
of one ramen and I both agree that the
three<00:05:15.040> series<00:05:15.340> is<00:05:15.460> one<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:15.730> best<00:05:15.910> cars

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
three series is one of the best cars

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.400 
three series is one of the best cars
ever<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:17.860> one<00:05:18.190> makes<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:19.030> few<00:05:19.300> things<00:05:19.630> happen
