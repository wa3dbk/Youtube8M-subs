00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
worries about that the motherboard it's

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.740 
worries about that the motherboard it's
uh<00:00:17.150> haven't<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.300> done<00:00:18.480> anything

uh haven't really done anything

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
uh haven't really done anything
different<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.320> been<00:00:19.590> testing<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.010> out

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
different just been testing it out

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.179 
different just been testing it out
making<00:00:20.460> sure<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.820> still<00:00:21.060> works<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> does

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
making sure it still works which it does

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.200 
making sure it still works which it does
but<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.260> got<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.400> case<00:00:26.609> cases

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
but as you can see I got my case cases

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.679 
but as you can see I got my case cases
formed<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:29.240> polystyrene<00:00:30.240> high-impact

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
formed it's polystyrene high-impact

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.080 
formed it's polystyrene high-impact
polystyrene<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.830> point<00:00:32.640> 1<00:00:32.820> inches

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
polystyrene it's like point 1 inches

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.090 
polystyrene it's like point 1 inches
thick<00:00:33.329> or<00:00:33.480> something<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.649> did<00:00:34.950> these

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
thick or something I actually did these

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.060 
thick or something I actually did these
a<00:00:35.130> couple<00:00:35.340> weeks<00:00:35.670> ago<00:00:36.620> they<00:00:37.620> turned<00:00:37.680> out<00:00:38.270> fine

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
a couple weeks ago they turned out fine

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.529 
a couple weeks ago they turned out fine
as<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:43.820> here<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:45.360> relief

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
as you can see here I got some relief

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.410 
as you can see here I got some relief
cuts<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.730> for<00:00:47.730> getting<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> mold<00:00:48.270> out

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
cuts for for getting the mold out

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.900 
cuts for for getting the mold out
because<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> hard<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:50.700> then

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
because it was kind of hard and then

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.959 
because it was kind of hard and then
this<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:52.530> didn't<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:52.920> form<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this one it didn't really form all the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.500 
this one it didn't really form all the
way<00:00:54.329> down<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.140> only<00:00:55.320> cutting<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.949> about

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
way down but I'm only cutting this about

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.830 
way down but I'm only cutting this about
3/4<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:58.039> about<00:00:59.039> half<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.460> inch<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.359> more

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
3/4 or about half an inch so that's more

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990 
3/4 or about half an inch so that's more
than<00:01:01.050> enough<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:02.820> gonna<00:01:02.940> be

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
than enough this is probably gonna be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
than enough this is probably gonna be
for<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> top<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
for the top and then this is like the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
for the top and then this is like the
bottom<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.640> either<00:01:05.939> gonna<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
bottom it's either gonna be this is

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
bottom it's either gonna be this is
gonna<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.260> inch<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> gonna

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gonna be an inch and then this is gonna

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.789 
gonna be an inch and then this is gonna
be<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:10.130> half<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.310> inch<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.850> 1.5<00:01:12.720> inches<00:01:13.320> total

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
be a half an inch so 1.5 inches total

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.370 
be a half an inch so 1.5 inches total
thickness<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.360> both<00:01:15.600> three

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
thickness or I'm going to do both three

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
thickness or I'm going to do both three
quarters<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> an<00:01:16.979> inch<00:01:17.070> thickness<00:01:17.750> I'm

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
quarters of an inch thickness I'm

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.999 
quarters of an inch thickness I'm
thinking<00:01:19.110> enough<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.439> some<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.740> research

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
thinking enough to do some more research

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.899 
thinking enough to do some more research
on<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:21.530> other<00:01:22.530> than<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.400> about

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
on that but other than that that's about

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
on that but other than that that's about
it<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> cases<00:01:25.409> are<00:01:25.590> formed<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.220> fine<00:01:26.490> I'll<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it the cases are formed out fine I'll be

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.090 
it the cases are formed out fine I'll be
cutting<00:01:27.390> them<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> getting<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> correct

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
cutting them out and getting the correct

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.969 
cutting them out and getting the correct
thickness<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:30.270> about<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> week<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.590> then

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
thickness in about a week or so and then

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219 
thickness in about a week or so and then
I<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.310> start<00:01:32.579> franking<00:01:33.090> casing<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> then

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I can start franking casing and then

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.359 
I can start franking casing and then
doing<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.490> board<00:01:36.000> work<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.369> that's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
doing some more board work and that's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:38.899 
doing some more board work and that's
about<00:01:38.549> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
about it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.149 
about it
I<00:01:39.060> plan<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.689> finishing<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.380> whole<00:01:40.560> project<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I plan on finishing the whole project in

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.109 
I plan on finishing the whole project in
April<00:01:41.659> mid<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.930> late<00:01:43.200> April<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.820> after

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
April mid to late April and then after

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
April mid to late April and then after
that<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.420> start<00:01:45.659> another<00:01:45.750> game<00:01:46.259> p4<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that I'm gonna start another game p4 of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.780 
that I'm gonna start another game p4 of
a<00:01:47.159> project<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.270> stay<00:01:48.540> tuned<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
a project so stay tuned for that

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.830 
a project so stay tuned for that
probably<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.149> many<00:01:51.270> features<00:01:51.600> as

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
probably I can have as many features as

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.510 
probably I can have as many features as
it<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> slimmed<00:01:53.430> down

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it would be more of a slimmed down

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.389 
it would be more of a slimmed down
version<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.960> smaller<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.470> stay

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
version but it will be smaller so stay

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.020 
version but it will be smaller so stay
tuned<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
tuned for that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.350 
tuned for that
alright<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.170> guys
