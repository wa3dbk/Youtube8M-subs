00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
little quick tutorial and it's not too

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
little quick tutorial and it's not too
hard<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> play<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.830> you've<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.580> an

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
hard to play this one you you've got an

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
hard to play this one you you've got an
intro<00:00:15.059> verse<00:00:15.450> 1<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.900> verse<00:00:15.960> 2<00:00:16.350> basically<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
intro verse 1 and verse 2 basically that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.380 
intro verse 1 and verse 2 basically that
you<00:00:17.100> need<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.430> look<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> learn<00:00:18.000> once<00:00:18.270> you've

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you need to look to learn once you've

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.260 
you need to look to learn once you've
got<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:18.630> streetable<00:00:19.020> sequences<00:00:20.270> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
got there streetable sequences that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.140 
got there streetable sequences that
those<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.750> used<00:00:21.900> through<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> whole<00:00:22.350> song<00:00:22.590> so

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
those are used through the whole song so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.310 
those are used through the whole song so
it's<00:00:24.150> three<00:00:24.359> components<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it's three components really so the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980 
it's three components really so the
intro<00:00:25.680> starts<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> B<00:00:27.119> I'll<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.779> play<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
intro starts on a B I'll just play it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:40.869 
intro starts on a B I'll just play it
through<00:00:28.230> once

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:48.209 

okay<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:45.739> b.i.g

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
okay so it's a b.i.g

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.340 
okay so it's a b.i.g
then<00:00:48.520> if<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:49.149> plan<00:00:49.390> if<00:00:49.629> maybe<00:00:49.840> seven<00:00:50.230> because

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
then if I plan if maybe seven because

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.190 
then if I plan if maybe seven because
it's<00:00:50.559> just<00:00:50.680> easier

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.930 

and<00:00:54.470> Tony<00:00:54.739> said

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and Tony said

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.639 
and Tony said
you<00:00:57.390> can't<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> barcodes<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> if

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you can't do the barcodes for that if

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.070 
you can't do the barcodes for that if
you<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> find<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.460> easier

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.650 

but<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.400> personally<00:01:08.910> don't<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.270> sounds

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
but I personally don't think that sounds

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.380 
but I personally don't think that sounds
good<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.650> whatever<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.370> like<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
good so whatever you like so that's the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
good so whatever you like so that's the
intro<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.320> also<00:01:13.650> repeated<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.370> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
intro and that's also repeated in the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
intro and that's also repeated in the
bridge<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.170> setting<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.010> an<00:01:17.100> English
