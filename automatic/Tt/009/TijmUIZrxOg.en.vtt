it's<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.090> knife<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.629> believe<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> blade

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it's a big knife I believe the blade

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
it's a big knife I believe the blade
cutting<00:01:03.000> edge<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:04.140> three

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cutting edge is a little over three

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.210 
cutting edge is a little over three
inches<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.890> whole<00:01:05.070> blades<00:01:05.369> closer<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.060> four

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
inches the whole blades closer to four

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.469 
inches the whole blades closer to four
it<00:01:08.220> fits<00:01:08.430> real<00:01:08.640> good<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> hand<00:01:09.150> though<00:01:09.330> if

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it fits real good in the hand though if

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.660 
it fits real good in the hand though if
you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:12.049> that's<00:01:13.159> lock<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you can see that that's lock up on you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
you can see that that's lock up on you
so<00:01:14.850> pretty<00:01:15.030> early<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.270> centered<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.780> as

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so pretty early it is centered and as

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.550 
so pretty early it is centered and as
you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:22.100> fairly<00:01:23.100> smooth

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
you can see there it is fairly smooth

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
you can see there it is fairly smooth
that's<00:01:25.560> with<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.009> five<00:01:26.580> minutes<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.060> me

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that's with about five minutes of me

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.960 
that's with about five minutes of me
just<00:01:27.689> greasing<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.009> better<00:01:29.540> but

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
just greasing it a little bit better but

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.219 
just greasing it a little bit better but
for<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> fraction<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> price<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.049> real

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
for a fraction of the price of a real

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.660 
for a fraction of the price of a real
thing<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> pretty<00:01:35.159> awesome<00:01:35.540> replica
