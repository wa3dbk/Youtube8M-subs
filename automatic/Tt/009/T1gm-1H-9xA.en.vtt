00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.710 
quintessential volume I stopped moving
and<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.430> epiphany<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.090> seems<00:02:33.300> sudden<00:02:33.690> but

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and in an epiphany that seems sudden but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
and in an epiphany that seems sudden but
is<00:02:33.960> actually<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> result<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> evolution

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
is actually the result of the evolution

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
is actually the result of the evolution
of<00:02:35.790> incremental<00:02:36.540> understanding<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.770> realized

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
of incremental understanding I realized

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.380 
of incremental understanding I realized
that<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.300> there<00:02:39.930> were<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.440> manual<00:02:41.070> no<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.150> would

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
that if there were a manual no one would

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.010 
that if there were a manual no one would
read<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:43.070> because<00:02:44.070> no<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:44.820> ever<00:02:45.270> reads

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
read it because no one ever reads

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.060 
read it because no one ever reads
instructions<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.840> maybe<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.830> aren't

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
instructions because maybe we aren't

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.940 
instructions because maybe we aren't
supposed<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.820> maybe<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> hands<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:52.860> the
