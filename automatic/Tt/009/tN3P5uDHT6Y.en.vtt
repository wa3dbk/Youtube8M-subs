00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 and now it's time for you to meet 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.309
 best and closely the agency refers 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.540
 commanded by otavio days she became 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 positions as an agency 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 multidisciplinary or has projects and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.719
 active customers in different 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.719
 communication disciplines 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.540
 the desire of the beginning of the repense was to make 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 an agency and had a little more 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 in tune with what was happening 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.560
 with the world of communication that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.650
 we can hardly separate the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.480
 digital medium of the offline world and that the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.830
 communication can also do some 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.900
 thing for a better world 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.940
 Think about it, it's about rethinking the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.000
 commutation and we are here today completed 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.370
 17 years celebrating all the victories and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.020
 especially thanking everyone 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.030
 people and all customers and 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.290
 partners who believed in us and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.290
 So, until today 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 we founded the agency with three children 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.960
 The first belief was what the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.520
 people called and even today calls 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.080
 disciplinary impartiality 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.200
 our creative profile is very interesting 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.420
 It's really multifaceted, it's us. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.119
 brought is different people profiles 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.789
 different specialties and this does not 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.530
 start it causes a bit of difficulty 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.880
 until everyone understands that it has a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.190
 platform that we need 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.690
 establish but later when you 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.709
 makes everyone understand the 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.000
 subjects 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.560
 you transform the professionals and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.539
 more multidisciplinary professionals 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.729
 best first case in a way 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.759
 general is and the idea is to always 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.149
 this is not a very strong tool for 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.450
 the customer ie looking at problem of the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.700
 customer or customer product with spain 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.010
 with fairness look at him 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.630
 find out the best platform for 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 communicate his product 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.740
 the second belief was a matter of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.930
 transversality of marketing 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.370
 digital marketing relationship 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.170
 today everything is internet relationship 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.500
 we can talk about site portal 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.200
 hotsites social network is all refers to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.880
 interactivity to relationship 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.180
 to rethink 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.370
 worked shape is integrated with 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.420
 communicated with the communication 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.620
 digital and getting the results 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.830
 exceptional circumstances in some clients such as 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.980
 Hi, where have we worked? 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.650
 on these two fronts and has been 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.900
 actually very good results to 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.520
 third belief and that perhaps it is the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 The more I move is as a human being is that 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.900
 brands can also do something for the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 world for a better world is every time 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.160
 more the reputation of the brands the reputation 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.830
 corporate governance is also linked to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 dimension of how it handles the medium 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.310
 environment and society with 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.450
 people what she does for the next to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.000
 the development of the country 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.460
 this is a frequent demand to repense 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.740
 has an area and differential with expertise 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.590
 in the third sector responsibility 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.900
 social and sustainability 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.420
 communication and advertising and marketing 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.830
 relationship of the union of these two ex 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.040
 and made sure that we could 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.170
 to the market is both a 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.360
 consulting to startup the institutes and 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.910
 foundations as well as plans 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.680
 to communicate this 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.560
 with value and that this value can be 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.210
 business is one thing. 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.220
 perhaps somewhat utopian in the perception of 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.780
 a lot of people but when I see that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.570
 within the agency cases we have 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.850
 several examples of the attitude of some 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.590
 the brands we took and the ones that we 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.720
 we take to companies that are 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.459
 transformed into attitudes that at the same 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.730
 time that reinforces the brand image 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.290
 strengthens corporate reputation and makes 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.440
 also something more for the people 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.170
 society is the concrete proof that 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.730
 if this is only a utopian or 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.540
 philosophical we develop a 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.390
 work for the third sector with focus on 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.000
 especially in raising funds to 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.100
 non - governmental organizations dn people 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.820
 so that they can develop their 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.070
 environmental causes 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.900
 resources they need resources to 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.730
 develop your projects 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.310
 suddenly specialized in 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.310
 develop campaigns that seek 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.800
 donor people as an agent who can 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.990
 contribute monthly sometimes 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.990
 per annum amount of money going 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.230
 revert to these projects 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.930
 socio-environmental 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.220
 We run pre-campaigns 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.550
 international organizations and 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.280
 Brazilian organizations is stimulating the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.190
 philanthropy with Brazilians and 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.840
 works communication does not mean 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.390
 stimulating consumption and stimulating 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.340
 buy stimulate the sale stimulate the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.710
 mercantilist side of the hill is to work 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.540
 communication can also mean 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.970
 to stimulate generosity 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.370
 awareness and stimulate people to 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.350
 people to be better people and 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.850
 help Honduras a better world 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.670
 then also thinking about this dimension 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.150
 contribution to the social contribution of 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.490
 repense is we have created a project of our own 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.220
 movement of the end that is there that surrounds 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.320
 both a magazine and the portal that today 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.000
 has more than 36 mgs 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.580
 when we enable participation 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.560
 of donation of individuals directly 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.560
 to the legions bank account 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.110
 Please rethink me, it's used to 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.450
 meal opportunity for me and think 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.450
 creative agency of my residence is 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.610
 a 360 real agency a beauty 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.220
 you never regretted it really 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.040
 an agency that thinks outside the box 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.630
 the word that suddenly represents me 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.740
 it is competence and passion inspiration and 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.540
 integrity the opportunity to 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.190
 transform and make different 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.720
 we have to think that the change that 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.180
 we want to see have to be ourselves 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.990
 and from there we can make a 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.440
 better world 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:31.890
 is this the most important values today 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.890
 and the moral and made for me is heart 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.260
 I think today she thinks there she is 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.060
 mature and prepared to respond is the 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.350
 any communication challenge a bit 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.390
 the size of the brand does not matter the size 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.250
 company is normally competing 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.990
 terms of positioning with the agencies 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.850
 can not only 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.950
 but all international 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.710
 This coming to Brazil, so today, the 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.480
 idea is above the media he is very 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.720
 happy very happy to see the customers 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.000
 here divergence is recognized and 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.040
 respected is a show to celebrate the 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.490
 reason to thank the one who is 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.490
 doing today 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.550
