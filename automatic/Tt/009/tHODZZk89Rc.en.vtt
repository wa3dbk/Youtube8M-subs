00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the large filter basket to work with so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.940 
the large filter basket to work with so
we<00:02:41.470> took<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.280> 3<00:02:42.520> by<00:02:42.640> 4<00:02:42.940> unit<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.590> installed<00:02:44.590> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
we took the 3 by 4 unit and installed a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.710 
we took the 3 by 4 unit and installed a
reducer<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.070> bottom<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:49.000> reducer

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
reducer and on the bottom this reducer

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.320 
reducer and on the bottom this reducer
is<00:02:49.870> what<00:02:50.290> allows<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:51.130> your<00:02:51.550> down<00:02:51.820> pipe<00:02:52.120> to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
is what allows for your down pipe to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.990 
is what allows for your down pipe to
slip<00:02:52.570> over<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.490> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.730> sit

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
slip over this so this is going to sit

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.810 
slip over this so this is going to sit
