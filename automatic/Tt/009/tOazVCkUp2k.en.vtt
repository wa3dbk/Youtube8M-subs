turns out that was ashley is or arc i

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
turns out that was ashley is or arc i
guess<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.159> didn't<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.180> too<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.480> of<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
guess but didn't make too much of a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.000 
guess but didn't make too much of a
difference<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.230> my<00:01:22.409> hydro<00:01:22.680> pump<00:01:22.830> was

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
difference because my hydro pump was

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.950 
difference because my hydro pump was
enough<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.460> him<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.730> so<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:24.630> he's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
enough to take him out so right now he's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.930 
enough to take him out so right now he's
going<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> Sharpedo<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
going into the Sharpedo so I'm going to

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.240 
going into the Sharpedo so I'm going to
be<00:01:27.030> switching<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:28.470> Vaseline<00:01:28.979> which

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
be switching out to my my Vaseline which

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.430

is<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.460> Toxicroak<00:01:30.120> hoping<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> go<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
is my Toxicroak hoping to go for the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.469 
is my Toxicroak hoping to go for the
super<00:01:31.680> effective<00:01:31.890> fighting<00:01:32.670> type<00:01:32.940> move<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
super effective fighting type move and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.180 
super effective fighting type move and
he<00:01:33.600> sets<00:01:33.870> up<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> protect<00:01:34.440> but<00:01:34.710> didn't<00:01:35.130> do

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
he sets up the protect but didn't do

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.250 
he sets up the protect but didn't do
anything<00:01:35.370> so<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.670> switched<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:36.780> looks<00:01:37.200> like

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
anything so I switched out so looks like

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.050 
anything so I switched out so looks like
i'll<00:01:37.890> probably<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.220> gone<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.940> another

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
i'll probably be gone for another

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
i'll probably be gone for another
protect<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.690> turn<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:39.960> sure<00:01:40.290> enough<00:01:40.320> he

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
protect this turn and sure enough he

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.950

without taking any damage so let's see

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.149 
without taking any damage so let's see
if<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.500> hit<00:01:52.770> him<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> time

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
if I can actually hit him this time

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.440 
if I can actually hit him this time
around<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.790> he<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:53.970> goes<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.390> the

actually goes out into his krookodile
which<00:02:41.969> he<00:02:42.120> obviously<00:02:42.359> should<00:02:42.719> have<00:02:42.810> gone<00:02:42.930> off

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139
