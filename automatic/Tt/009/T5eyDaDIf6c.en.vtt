you

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.850 

it's<00:00:09.209> not<00:00:09.360> really<00:00:09.660> any<00:00:09.809> motivating<00:00:10.440> factor

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
it's not really any motivating factor

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.070 
it's not really any motivating factor
for<00:00:10.889> kids<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.459> come<00:00:12.150> home<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.539> grab<00:00:12.809> their

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
for kids to come home and grab their

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.749 
for kids to come home and grab their
technical<00:00:13.410> exercise<00:00:13.920> book<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.369> of<00:00:14.400> their<00:00:14.609> bag

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
technical exercise book out of their bag

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
technical exercise book out of their bag
and<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.779> think<00:00:15.990> that's<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.259> main<00:00:16.439> problem

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and I think that's the main problem

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.990 
and I think that's the main problem
there's<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.400> much<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.610> could<00:00:17.880> be

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
there's so much that could be

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.499 
there's so much that could be
accomplished<00:00:18.570> using<00:00:18.869> technical<00:00:19.619> exercises

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
accomplished using technical exercises

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.029 
accomplished using technical exercises
but<00:00:21.509> I<00:00:21.720> don't<00:00:21.930> think<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.230> being<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> comp<00:00:22.800> as

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
but I don't think it's being a comp as

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.709 
but I don't think it's being a comp as
well<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.669> we<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.210> them<00:00:24.329> at<00:00:24.419> the<00:00:24.509> start

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:24.719 
well as it could we do them at the start

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:25.850 
well as it could we do them at the start
of<00:00:24.809> the<00:00:24.840> lesson<00:00:25.169> because<00:00:25.349> you<00:00:25.529> feel<00:00:25.649> like<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
of the lesson because you feel like you

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.799 
of the lesson because you feel like you
have<00:00:26.009> to<00:00:26.040> feel<00:00:26.520> like<00:00:26.669> you<00:00:26.759> should<00:00:26.969> the<00:00:27.599> kids

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:27.809 
have to feel like you should the kids

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:30.260 
have to feel like you should the kids
comply<00:00:28.259> but<00:00:28.860> it's<00:00:29.040> really<00:00:29.309> not<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.610> great<00:00:29.939> way

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
comply but it's really not a great way

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.269 
comply but it's really not a great way

come in the door I don't let's play our
technical<00:00:34.530> exercise<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.700> kids

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
technical exercise we all know that kids

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.970 
technical exercise we all know that kids
should<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.539> doing<00:00:36.780> technical<00:00:37.200> exercises<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
should be doing technical exercises and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.709 
should be doing technical exercises and
I've<00:00:38.100> seen<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.820> benefits<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.360> come<00:00:39.660> from

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I've seen the benefits that come from

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
I've seen the benefits that come from
using<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.710> those<00:00:40.800> few<00:00:41.100> students<00:00:41.489> who

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
using it for those few students who

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.210 
using it for those few students who
actually<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:42.210> practice<00:00:42.630> them<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.900> home

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
actually do practice them at home

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.800 
actually do practice them at home
they're<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.400> ones<00:00:44.579> who<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.329> fabulous

feeling into it and then we get to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
feeling into it and then we get to
technical<00:00:56.579> exercises<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.540> they're<00:00:58.140> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
technical exercises and they're just

technical exercises and they're just
like<00:00:58.440> math<00:00:58.649> drills<00:00:58.950> we're<00:00:59.220> sending<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.610> home

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
like math drills we're sending them home

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.280 
like math drills we're sending them home
with<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.270> boring<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:00.930> bits<00:01:01.170> of
