package from my time playing black ops 2
I<00:00:47.010> learned<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> most<00:00:47.820> expensive

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
I learned that the most expensive

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
I learned that the most expensive
internet<00:00:49.079> packages<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.160> ones<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.460> have

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
internet packages and the ones that have

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
internet packages and the ones that have
the<00:00:50.760> highest<00:00:50.910> download<00:00:51.809> speed<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.320> actually

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the highest download speed are actually

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.880 
the highest download speed are actually
not<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.760> best<00:00:53.969> choice<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.300> gaming<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
not the best choice for gaming this is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.229 
not the best choice for gaming this is
because<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.280> developers<00:00:56.520> came<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
because the developers came up with a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.619 
because the developers came up with a
brilliant<00:00:57.329> idea<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.160> lag<00:00:59.160> compensation<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
brilliant idea of lag compensation this

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
brilliant idea of lag compensation this
is<00:01:00.780> why<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> didn't<00:01:01.469> enjoy<00:01:01.620> black<00:01:02.039> ops<00:01:02.280> 2<00:01:02.520> as

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
is why I didn't enjoy black ops 2 as

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
is why I didn't enjoy black ops 2 as
much<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.120> other<00:01:03.390> people<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:04.260> connection

much as other people my connection

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.950 
much as other people my connection
forced<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> play<00:01:05.610> far<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.299> conservatively

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
forced me to play far too conservatively

rarely<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:17.040> lag<00:01:17.280> issues<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.720> less<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
rarely get lag issues so here less is

my mw3 and black ops 2 footage this game
here<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.659> played<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.140> two<00:02:04.500> TV<00:02:04.950> with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
here was played on a two TV with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.169 
here was played on a two TV with
virtually<00:02:05.880> no<00:02:06.180> response<00:02:06.960> time<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:08.179> don't

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
virtually no response time and I don't

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.450 
virtually no response time and I don't
slow<00:02:09.509> down<00:02:09.690> much

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
slow down much

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.630 
slow down much
so<00:02:10.790> if<00:02:11.180> you're<00:02:11.480> gaming<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.960> 55<00:02:12.470> inch<00:02:12.500> TV<00:02:12.920> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so if you're gaming on a 55 inch TV you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.730 
so if you're gaming on a 55 inch TV you
don't<00:02:13.820> realize<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.390> but<00:02:14.660> input<00:02:15.110> lag<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.530> an

don't realize it but input lag is an
