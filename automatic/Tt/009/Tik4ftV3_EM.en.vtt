00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.179 

I've<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> couple<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.770> shots<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
I've got my a couple of shots of the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
I've got my a couple of shots of the
orchid<00:00:20.580> I've<00:00:20.970> already<00:00:21.240> put<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.420> card<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.960> my

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
orchid I've already put my card in my

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
orchid I've already put my card in my
computer<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.100> here's<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.000> seeing<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
computer and here's what I'm seeing in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.500 
computer and here's what I'm seeing in
Adobe<00:00:25.350> bridge<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.820> shooting<00:00:27.119> raw<00:00:27.269> plus

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
Adobe bridge I was shooting raw plus

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.929 
Adobe bridge I was shooting raw plus
JPEG<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.230> I've<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.560> four<00:00:28.920> files<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.849> my

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
JPEG so I've got four files here for my

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.339 
JPEG so I've got four files here for my
two<00:00:30.000> final<00:00:30.599> images<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.080> gonna<00:00:31.170> work

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
two final images I'm just gonna work

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
two final images I'm just gonna work
with<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> JPEGs<00:00:31.949> right<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:32.759> they<00:00:33.120> had

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
with the JPEGs right now if they had

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.580 
with the JPEGs right now if they had
blown<00:00:33.450> highlights<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.050> something<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> would

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
blown highlights or something I would

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
blown highlights or something I would
probably<00:00:34.710> work<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> Raw's<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> think

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
probably work with the Raw's but I think

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.459 
probably work with the Raw's but I think
this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.510> easier<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
this is going to be easier this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.660 
this is going to be easier this
technique<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> work<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> any

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
technique is going to work with any

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.630 
technique is going to work with any
version<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.390> Photoshop<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.680> layers<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
version of Photoshop that has layers and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
version of Photoshop that has layers and
layer<00:00:41.910> masks<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> most<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
layer masks which is most of the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.290 
layer masks which is most of the
versions<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.800> back<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.430> least<00:00:44.550> 15

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
versions going back for at least 15

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
versions going back for at least 15
years<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> ought<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.559> okay<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.489> steps

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
years so you ought to be okay some steps

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.520 
years so you ought to be okay some steps
are<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.090> easier<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.930> using<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
are going to be easier if you're using a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
are going to be easier if you're using a
somewhat<00:00:49.950> newer<00:00:50.129> version<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.480> bridge

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
somewhat newer version so here in bridge

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
somewhat newer version so here in bridge
I<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.140> selected<00:00:52.500> both<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.100> these<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.610> did<00:00:53.760> that

both of those documents or both of those
images<00:01:09.240> into<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> single<00:01:09.930> Photoshop<00:01:10.409> document

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
images into a single Photoshop document

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
images into a single Photoshop document
and<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.720> each<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and it's going to put each one in a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.620 
and it's going to put each one in a
separate<00:01:13.890> layer<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.180> could

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
separate layer so here we go I could

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.270 
separate layer so here we go I could
also<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> manually<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.650> could<00:01:16.950> load<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
also do that manually I could load the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
also do that manually I could load the
first<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.729> load<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> second<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.720> select<00:01:19.080> all

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
first one load the second one select all

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
first one load the second one select all
copy<00:01:19.470> paste<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> first<00:01:20.729> one

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
copy paste it into the first one

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
copy paste it into the first one
whatever<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.900> need<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.229> sure<00:01:22.380> they're

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
whatever I just need to be sure they're

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
whatever I just need to be sure they're
both<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.850> hide<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
both in here I'm gonna hide this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090 
both in here I'm gonna hide this
uppermost<00:01:24.570> layer<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> see

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
uppermost layer and there you can see

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
uppermost layer and there you can see
the<00:01:26.220> lower<00:01:26.400> ones<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the lower ones so in this top one this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
the lower ones so in this top one this
stuff<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> focus<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.869> bottom<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
stuff is in focus in the bottom one this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
stuff is in focus in the bottom one this
stuff<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> focus<00:01:32.790> now<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> turn<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.720> off

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
stuff is in focus now as I turn that off

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
stuff is in focus now as I turn that off
and<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> also<00:01:35.759> see<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> whole

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and on you can also see this whole

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
and on you can also see this whole
structure<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.170> shifting<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> left

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
structure here is shifting to the left

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
structure here is shifting to the left
so<00:01:39.329> these<00:01:39.570> images<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> alignment

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so these images are out of alignment

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.539 
so these images are out of alignment
I<00:01:40.920> could<00:01:41.670> manually<00:01:42.150> align<00:01:42.840> them<00:01:43.110> by<00:01:43.549> lowering

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
I could manually align them by lowering

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
I could manually align them by lowering
the<00:01:44.850> opacity<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.990> upper<00:01:46.320> layer<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.799> then

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the opacity on the upper layer and then

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.510 
the opacity on the upper layer and then
grabbing<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> move<00:01:48.270> tool<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.220> dragging<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
grabbing the move tool and dragging it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
grabbing the move tool and dragging it
around<00:01:50.659> until<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.869> are<00:01:52.170> aligned<00:01:52.740> there's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
around until these are aligned there's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.870 
around until these are aligned there's
an<00:01:53.790> easier<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.219> in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
an easier way to do it and that is to in

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880 
an easier way to do it and that is to in
the<00:01:57.030> layers<00:01:57.210> palette<00:01:57.540> select<00:01:58.530> both<00:01:58.860> layers

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the layers palette select both layers

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.330 
the layers palette select both layers
and<00:01:59.610> go<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> edit<00:02:00.479> Auto<00:02:01.290> align<00:02:01.740> layers<00:02:02.009> now

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and go to edit Auto align layers now

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
and go to edit Auto align layers now
this<00:02:02.520> only<00:02:02.700> works<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> last<00:02:03.600> couple<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this only works with the last couple of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.929 
this only works with the last couple of
versions<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.979> Photoshop<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> only

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
versions of Photoshop they are the only

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.639 
versions of Photoshop they are the only
ones<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.390> auto<00:02:06.540> alignment<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.590> I'm

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
ones that have auto alignment so I'm

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
ones that have auto alignment so I'm
just<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> ask<00:02:08.910> me

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just gonna do that it's going to ask me

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.229 
just gonna do that it's going to ask me
what<00:02:10.670> algorithm<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.970> use<00:02:12.060> for

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
what algorithm I want to use for

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.900 
what algorithm I want to use for
alignment<00:02:12.450> I'm<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:12.780> gonna<00:02:12.870> choose<00:02:13.080> Auto

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
alignment I'm just gonna choose Auto

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.390 
alignment I'm just gonna choose Auto
say<00:02:14.240> okay<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.860> little<00:02:15.890> bit<00:02:16.280> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
say okay and with just a little bit of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.640 
say okay and with just a little bit of
thinking<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:17.000> has<00:02:17.330> aligned<00:02:17.660> my<00:02:17.840> images<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.500> me

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
thinking it has aligned my images for me

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.170 
thinking it has aligned my images for me
if<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.920> turn<00:02:19.160> off<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.520> visibility<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:20.000> that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
if I turn off the visibility on that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.820 
if I turn off the visibility on that
upper<00:02:20.390> one<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.350> see<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.530> they're

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
upper one you can see that they're

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.680 
upper one you can see that they're
sitting<00:02:22.040> right<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.400> top<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.820> each<00:02:23.000> other<00:02:23.240> it's

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
sitting right on top of each other it's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.510 
sitting right on top of each other it's
also<00:02:23.870> possibly<00:02:24.320> done<00:02:24.500> some<00:02:24.710> rotation<00:02:25.250> maybe

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
also possibly done some rotation maybe

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.790 
also possibly done some rotation maybe
even<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:26.030> tilting<00:02:26.570> it's<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.290> very<00:02:27.590> good

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
even a little tilting it's a very good

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.250 
even a little tilting it's a very good
alignment<00:02:28.040> feature<00:02:28.460> now<00:02:28.910> if<00:02:29.510> I'm<00:02:29.720> using<00:02:29.960> a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
alignment feature now if I'm using a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
alignment feature now if I'm using a
version<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.860> has<00:02:31.070> auto<00:02:31.310> alignment<00:02:31.940> then<00:02:32.360> I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
version that has auto alignment then I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.970 
version that has auto alignment then I
also<00:02:32.600> have<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.870> way<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.080> automatically<00:02:33.620> blend

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
also have a way to automatically blend

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.170 
also have a way to automatically blend
these<00:02:34.100> together<00:02:34.340> we're<00:02:34.700> not<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> do

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
these together we're not going to do

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.720 
these together we're not going to do
that<00:02:35.360> yet<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:36.050> want<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> show<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.950> completely

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
that yet I want to show you a completely

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.390 
that yet I want to show you a completely
manual<00:02:38.210> way<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.900> doing<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.440> just<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:40.160> if

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
manual way of doing it just because if

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920 
manual way of doing it just because if
you<00:02:40.520> don't<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> previous<00:02:41.480> version<00:02:41.660> of

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
you don't have a previous version of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.240 
you don't have a previous version of
Photoshop<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.320> may<00:02:42.530> not<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.980> Auto

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
Photoshop you may not have that Auto

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.980 
Photoshop you may not have that Auto
option<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.880> even<00:02:44.270> if<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.570> have<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> auto

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
option and even if you do have the auto

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.480 
option and even if you do have the auto
option<00:02:45.470> there<00:02:45.590> are<00:02:45.650> gonna<00:02:45.740> be<00:02:45.830> times<00:02:46.100> where

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
option there are gonna be times where

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.220 
option there are gonna be times where
it's<00:02:46.970> nice<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> little<00:02:47.600> more<00:02:47.840> control

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
it's nice to have a little more control

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.950 
it's nice to have a little more control
so<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:49.370> selecting<00:02:49.940> my<00:02:50.030> upper<00:02:50.360> layer<00:02:50.570> here<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
so I'm selecting my upper layer here and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.230 
so I'm selecting my upper layer here and
I'm<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.410> add<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> layer<00:02:51.920> mask<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.880> down

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
I'm going to add a layer mask to it down

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.300 
I'm going to add a layer mask to it down
at<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> bottom<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.870> layers<00:02:54.080> palette<00:02:54.410> this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
at the bottom of the layers palette this

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.870 
at the bottom of the layers palette this
button<00:02:55.670> right<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:55.970> adds<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:57.170> layer<00:02:57.500> mask

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
button right here adds a layer mask

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.040 
button right here adds a layer mask
right<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.090> mask<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.540> white<00:02:59.780> which<00:03:00.020> means

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
right now the mask is white which means

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.650 
right now the mask is white which means
every<00:03:00.680> bit<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.370> layer<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.880> visible<00:03:02.390> so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
every bit of this layer is visible so

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.390 
every bit of this layer is visible so
I'm<00:03:02.750> going<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:02.960> fill<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.320> with<00:03:03.410> black<00:03:03.800> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
I'm going to fill it with black the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.680 
I'm going to fill it with black the
easiest<00:03:04.670> way<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.910> do<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.210> is<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.450> make<00:03:05.570> sure

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
easiest way to do that is to make sure

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.750 
easiest way to do that is to make sure
that<00:03:05.870> black<00:03:06.110> is<00:03:06.320> my<00:03:06.470> background<00:03:06.920> color<00:03:07.160> which

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
that black is my background color which

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.100 
that black is my background color which
I<00:03:07.880> can<00:03:08.030> do<00:03:08.150> by<00:03:08.330> clicking<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.900> little

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
I can do by clicking on that little

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.990 
I can do by clicking on that little
thing<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.320> there<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.490> hitting<00:03:10.730> and

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
thing right there and just hitting and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.450 
thing right there and just hitting and
then<00:03:11.120> hitting<00:03:11.420> command<00:03:11.840> delete<00:03:12.190> fills<00:03:13.190> my

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
then hitting command delete fills my

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.730 
then hitting command delete fills my
layer<00:03:13.640> mask<00:03:13.730> with<00:03:14.120> black<00:03:14.270> now<00:03:14.630> no<00:03:14.930> part<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
layer mask with black now no part of the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.490 
layer mask with black now no part of the
upper<00:03:16.160> image<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.180> visible<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.080> what<00:03:18.230> I'm<00:03:18.320> left

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
upper image is visible so what I'm left

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.230 
upper image is visible so what I'm left
with<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.980> seeing<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.370> lower<00:03:19.520> image<00:03:19.790> which<00:03:20.210> is

with is seeing the lower image which is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.920 
with is seeing the lower image which is
the<00:03:20.480> part<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.720> has<00:03:20.960> this<00:03:21.710> bit<00:03:22.070> in<00:03:22.310> focus<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.570> I

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the part that has this bit in focus if I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.200 
the part that has this bit in focus if I
now<00:03:24.080> take<00:03:24.140> my<00:03:24.530> paintbrush<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.430> some<00:03:25.970> white

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
now take my paintbrush and some white

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.140 
now take my paintbrush and some white
paint<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.860> just<00:03:27.860> start<00:03:28.160> painting<00:03:28.670> into<00:03:29.000> my

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
paint and just start painting into my

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.520 
paint and just start painting into my
mask<00:03:29.360> I'm<00:03:29.600> going<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.810> click<00:03:29.960> that<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.260> make<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
mask I'm going to click that to make it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.610 
mask I'm going to click that to make it
selected<00:03:31.010> what<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.090> doing<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.780> refining

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
selected what I'm now doing is refining

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.570 
selected what I'm now doing is refining
my<00:03:33.860> mask<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.910> reveal<00:03:35.480> these<00:03:36.230> bits<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.950> this

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
my mask to reveal these bits of this

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.840 
my mask to reveal these bits of this
upper<00:03:37.970> layer<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.480> these<00:03:38.750> bits<00:03:39.050> are<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.410> focus

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
upper layer and these bits are in focus

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.490 
upper layer and these bits are in focus
so<00:03:40.850> I'm<00:03:40.940> able<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.210> selectively<00:03:41.900> paint<00:03:42.260> in

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
so I'm able to selectively paint in

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.830 
so I'm able to selectively paint in
these<00:03:43.280> focused<00:03:43.790> areas<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.420> other<00:03:44.600> layer

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
these focused areas of this other layer

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840 
these focused areas of this other layer
okay<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.530> bit<00:03:45.770> is<00:03:45.890> not<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.220> focus<00:03:46.370> I've<00:03:46.730> gone

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
okay that bit is not in focus I've gone

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.240 
okay that bit is not in focus I've gone
too<00:03:47.120> far<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.470> I'm<00:03:48.560> going<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.709> switch<00:03:48.920> back<00:03:48.950> to

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
too far so I'm going to switch back to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.449 
too far so I'm going to switch back to
black<00:03:49.459> paint<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.030> paint<00:03:50.300> back<00:03:50.720> over<00:03:51.050> those

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
black paint and paint back over those

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.350 
black paint and paint back over those
one<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.610> things<00:03:52.760> you'll<00:03:52.880> find<00:03:52.910> about

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
one of the things you'll find about

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.630 
one of the things you'll find about
depth<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.750> field<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.080> it's<00:03:54.230> very<00:03:54.380> strange<00:03:54.830> it's

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
depth of field is it's very strange it's

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.830 
depth of field is it's very strange it's
sometimes<00:03:56.330> difficult<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.170> tell<00:03:57.500> where<00:03:58.840> two

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
sometimes difficult to tell where two

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.060 
sometimes difficult to tell where two
different<00:04:00.140> parts<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.410> your<00:04:00.500> image<00:04:00.530> actually

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
different parts of your image actually

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.150 
different parts of your image actually
sit<00:04:01.280> on<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.490> same<00:04:01.700> plane<00:04:02.590> obviously<00:04:03.590> focus<00:04:04.010> is

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
sit on the same plane obviously focus is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.340 
sit on the same plane obviously focus is
all<00:04:04.310> about<00:04:04.580> distance<00:04:05.030> from<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.420> camera<00:04:05.780> so

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
all about distance from the camera so

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.600 
all about distance from the camera so
sometimes<00:04:06.770> you'll<00:04:06.950> think<00:04:07.130> something<00:04:07.430> should

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
sometimes you'll think something should

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.670 
sometimes you'll think something should
be<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.850> focus<00:04:08.240> and<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.840> won't<00:04:09.050> be<00:04:09.260> in<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.440> shot

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
be in focus and it won't be in a shot

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.050 
be in focus and it won't be in a shot
and<00:04:09.860> that's<00:04:09.920> because<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.370> actually<00:04:10.490> sits<00:04:10.880> on<00:04:11.030> a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and that's because it actually sits on a

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.699 
and that's because it actually sits on a
different<00:04:11.420> plane<00:04:12.260> than<00:04:12.290> you're<00:04:12.680> thinking

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
different plane than you're thinking

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.830 
different plane than you're thinking
it's<00:04:13.130> on<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.520> think<00:04:13.940> there's<00:04:14.120> some<00:04:14.300> focus<00:04:14.660> out

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
it's on I think there's some focus out

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.570 
it's on I think there's some focus out
here<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.200> be<00:04:15.320> had<00:04:15.500> there's<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.100> little<00:04:16.340> bit<00:04:16.459> out

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
here to be had there's a little bit out

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.010 
here to be had there's a little bit out
here<00:04:18.430> maybe<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.700> there<00:04:19.940> nope<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.600> doesn't<00:04:20.930> look

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
here maybe in there nope it doesn't look

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.600 
here maybe in there nope it doesn't look
like<00:04:21.170> it<00:04:21.290> I'm<00:04:21.380> using<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.709> X<00:04:21.890> key<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.490> switch

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
like it I'm using the X key to switch

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.880 
like it I'm using the X key to switch
back<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:22.970> forth<00:04:23.210> between<00:04:24.110> these<00:04:24.380> two<00:04:24.440> colors

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
back and forth between these two colors

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.350 
back and forth between these two colors
that's<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.160> very<00:04:25.340> simple<00:04:25.729> way<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.880> going<00:04:26.180> back

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
that's a very simple way of going back

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.310 
that's a very simple way of going back
and<00:04:26.390> forth

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
and forth

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.250 
and forth
between<00:04:27.680> black<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.010> white<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:30.080> that's

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
between black and white so that's

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.750 
between black and white so that's
looking<00:04:30.350> pretty<00:04:30.530> good<00:04:30.740> I've<00:04:31.040> now<00:04:31.220> blended

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
looking pretty good I've now blended

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.820 
looking pretty good I've now blended
these<00:04:31.910> two<00:04:32.270> different<00:04:32.810> layers<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.290> get<00:04:33.650> much

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
these two different layers to get much

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.140 
these two different layers to get much
deeper<00:04:34.130> depth<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.430> field<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:34.760> had<00:04:34.940> before

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
deeper depth of field that I had before

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.210 
deeper depth of field that I had before
these<00:04:35.570> are<00:04:35.720> now<00:04:35.840> in<00:04:35.960> focus<00:04:36.290> this<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.830> now<00:04:37.070> in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
these are now in focus this is now in

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.130 
these are now in focus this is now in
focus<00:04:37.580> look<00:04:38.000> at<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.240> stuff<00:04:38.480> it's<00:04:38.720> not<00:04:38.960> in

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
focus look at this stuff it's not in

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.980 
focus look at this stuff it's not in
focus<00:04:40.090> there's<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.180> little<00:04:41.420> bit<00:04:41.540> more<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.870> be

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
focus there's a little bit more to be

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.570 
focus there's a little bit more to be
had<00:04:42.170> there<00:04:42.200> than<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.650> thought<00:04:42.890> but<00:04:43.220> there's<00:04:43.370> not

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
had there than I thought but there's not

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.150 
had there than I thought but there's not
a<00:04:43.610> lot<00:04:44.090> what<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:44.840> needed<00:04:45.290> was<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.530> third<00:04:45.830> shot

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
a lot what I needed was a third shot

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.110 
a lot what I needed was a third shot
actually<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.240> looks<00:04:47.300> pretty<00:04:47.480> good<00:04:48.970> still<00:04:49.970> if

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
actually that looks pretty good still if

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.060 
actually that looks pretty good still if
I<00:04:50.240> had<00:04:50.270> done<00:04:50.570> another<00:04:50.900> shot<00:04:51.170> focusing<00:04:51.800> right

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
I had done another shot focusing right

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.280 
I had done another shot focusing right
in<00:04:52.310> here<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.090> would<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.660> gotten<00:04:53.840> these<00:04:54.020> things

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
in here I would have gotten these things

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.110 
in here I would have gotten these things
in<00:04:54.440> focus<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.010> maybe<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.670> edge<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:56.030> these

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
in focus and maybe the edge of these

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.570 
in focus and maybe the edge of these
petals<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:57.470> you'll<00:04:57.860> often<00:04:58.010> find<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.490> when

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
petals so you'll often find that when

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.460 
petals so you'll often find that when
you<00:04:58.790> do<00:04:58.880> your<00:04:59.000> focus<00:04:59.330> tacking<00:04:59.630> exercises<00:05:00.260> that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
you do your focus tacking exercises that

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.470 
you do your focus tacking exercises that
it's<00:05:00.650> hard<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.920> figure<00:05:01.130> out<00:05:01.280> how<00:05:01.580> many<00:05:02.240> layers

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
it's hard to figure out how many layers

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480 
it's hard to figure out how many layers
you<00:05:02.750> need<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.050> get<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:03.290> overlap<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:04.160> sometimes

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
you need to get the overlap so sometimes

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.560 
you need to get the overlap so sometimes
you<00:05:04.580> may<00:05:04.670> have<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.820> go<00:05:04.940> back<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.240> shoot<00:05:05.420> again

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
you may have to go back and shoot again

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.480 
you may have to go back and shoot again
you<00:05:06.320> might<00:05:06.440> be<00:05:06.590> wondering<00:05:06.890> what's<00:05:07.070> all<00:05:07.310> this

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
you might be wondering what's all this

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.850 
you might be wondering what's all this
checkerboard<00:05:07.880> stuff<00:05:08.480> well<00:05:08.750> when<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.320> aligned

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
checkerboard stuff well when I aligned

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.880 
checkerboard stuff well when I aligned
the<00:05:10.190> images<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.700> had<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.940> move<00:05:11.090> them<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:12.650> had<00:05:12.800> to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
the images it had to move them it had to

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.560 
the images it had to move them it had to
shift<00:05:13.100> them<00:05:13.310> around<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:13.850> it's<00:05:14.000> opened<00:05:14.450> up

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
shift them around and so it's opened up

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.570 
shift them around and so it's opened up
a<00:05:14.780> bunch<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.170> extra<00:05:15.500> space<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:15.920> my<00:05:16.040> document

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
a bunch of extra space in my document

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.440 
a bunch of extra space in my document
that's<00:05:17.270> areas<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:19.190> lower<00:05:19.490> layer<00:05:19.760> where

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
that's areas that the lower layer where

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.000 
that's areas that the lower layer where
the<00:05:20.480> lower<00:05:20.780> layer<00:05:20.960> has<00:05:21.170> no<00:05:21.350> content<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:21.860> what<00:05:21.950> I

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
the lower layer has no content so what I

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.400 
the lower layer has no content so what I
would<00:05:22.100> like<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.400> do<00:05:22.490> is<00:05:22.640> restore<00:05:23.210> those<00:05:24.020> areas

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
would like to do is restore those areas

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.310 
would like to do is restore those areas
of<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:25.070> upper<00:05:25.250> image<00:05:25.850> if<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.900> makes<00:05:27.110> no

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
of the upper image if that makes no

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.900 
of the upper image if that makes no
sense<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.830> don't<00:05:28.100> worry<00:05:28.340> it's<00:05:28.490> about<00:05:28.670> to

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
sense to you don't worry it's about to

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.730 
sense to you don't worry it's about to
when<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:29.540> see<00:05:29.750> what<00:05:29.930> happens<00:05:30.230> when<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.500> take

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
when you see what happens when I take

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.070 
when you see what happens when I take
white<00:05:31.040> paint<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:32.000> paint<00:05:32.390> into<00:05:32.540> my<00:05:32.660> mask<00:05:32.870> right

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
white paint and paint into my mask right

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.960 
white paint and paint into my mask right
here<00:05:33.140> so<00:05:33.530> what<00:05:33.620> you're<00:05:33.800> seeing<00:05:33.980> is<00:05:34.250> that<00:05:34.280> there

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
here so what you're seeing is that there

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.720 
here so what you're seeing is that there
is<00:05:35.270> content<00:05:35.810> in<00:05:36.080> my<00:05:36.290> upper<00:05:36.650> image<00:05:36.980> in<00:05:37.220> these

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
is content in my upper image in these

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.120 
is content in my upper image in these
locations<00:05:38.090> just<00:05:38.510> not<00:05:38.660> in<00:05:38.780> my<00:05:38.900> lower<00:05:39.110> image<00:05:39.380> so

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
locations just not in my lower image so

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.610 
locations just not in my lower image so
I'm<00:05:40.370> adjusting<00:05:40.640> my<00:05:40.850> mask<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.960> restore<00:05:42.380> these

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
I'm adjusting my mask to restore these

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.830 
I'm adjusting my mask to restore these
bits<00:05:42.920> of<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.190> upper<00:05:43.490> image<00:05:43.790> where<00:05:44.480> there<00:05:44.660> is

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
bits of the upper image where there is

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.770 
bits of the upper image where there is
data<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.350> said<00:05:46.220> as<00:05:46.490> you'll<00:05:47.030> recall<00:05:47.210> from<00:05:47.720> the

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
data that said as you'll recall from the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.200 
data that said as you'll recall from the
last<00:05:47.990> movie<00:05:48.410> I<00:05:48.440> intentionally<00:05:49.370> shot<00:05:49.670> this

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
last movie I intentionally shot this

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.470 
last movie I intentionally shot this
image<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.990> little<00:05:51.230> wider<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.890> needed<00:05:52.160> to

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
image a little wider that I needed to

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.730 
image a little wider that I needed to
because<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.510> wasn't<00:05:53.900> sure<00:05:54.170> how<00:05:54.200> when<00:05:54.710> I

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
because I wasn't sure how when I

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.010 
because I wasn't sure how when I
refocused<00:05:55.400> how<00:05:55.940> my<00:05:56.090> crop<00:05:56.330> was<00:05:56.510> gonna<00:05:56.630> work<00:05:56.810> so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
refocused how my crop was gonna work so

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.480 
refocused how my crop was gonna work so
actually<00:05:57.320> my<00:05:57.440> intent<00:05:57.800> when<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.010> shot<00:05:58.310> this

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
actually my intent when I shot this

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.980 
actually my intent when I shot this
movie<00:05:58.850> was<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.480> was<00:05:59.570> going<00:05:59.720> to<00:05:59.840> need<00:05:59.930> a

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
movie was that it was going to need a

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.540 
movie was that it was going to need a
crop<00:06:00.260> so<00:06:00.560> I'm<00:06:00.650> gonna<00:06:00.770> go<00:06:00.890> to<00:06:00.950> my<00:06:01.010> crop<00:06:01.310> tool

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
crop so I'm gonna go to my crop tool

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.790 
crop so I'm gonna go to my crop tool
here<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.030> I'm<00:06:02.780> gonna<00:06:02.900> go<00:06:03.080> ahead<00:06:03.170> and<00:06:03.290> pull<00:06:03.620> in

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
here and I'm gonna go ahead and pull in

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.630 
here and I'm gonna go ahead and pull in
a<00:06:04.660> two<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.690> three<00:06:05.990> aspect<00:06:06.410> ratio<00:06:06.740> to<00:06:07.130> preserve

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
a two to three aspect ratio to preserve

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.880 
a two to three aspect ratio to preserve
the<00:06:08.390> original<00:06:08.510> aspect<00:06:09.020> ratio<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.500> my<00:06:09.620> image

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
the original aspect ratio of my image

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.410 
the original aspect ratio of my image
and<00:06:10.310> I'm<00:06:10.520> just<00:06:10.610> gonna<00:06:10.700> crop<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.210> down

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
and I'm just gonna crop this down

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.700 
and I'm just gonna crop this down
because<00:06:11.600> this<00:06:11.990> was<00:06:12.170> the<00:06:12.350> thing<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.620> was

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
because this was the thing I was

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.640 
because this was the thing I was
interested<00:06:13.160> in<00:06:13.220> anyway<00:06:13.670> so<00:06:14.360> now<00:06:14.930> that<00:06:14.990> lost

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
interested in anyway so now that lost

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.740 
interested in anyway so now that lost
space<00:06:16.220> that<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.520> got<00:06:16.700> from<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.030> stack<00:06:17.240> doesn't

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
space that I got from the stack doesn't

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.480 
space that I got from the stack doesn't
really<00:06:17.900> matter<00:06:18.170> so<00:06:18.650> now<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:18.800> could<00:06:18.920> flatten<00:06:19.340> and

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
really matter so now I could flatten and

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.310 
really matter so now I could flatten and
save<00:06:19.670> and<00:06:19.970> then<00:06:20.330> I've<00:06:20.450> got<00:06:20.630> an<00:06:20.840> image<00:06:20.990> with

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
save and then I've got an image with

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.010 
save and then I've got an image with
much<00:06:21.830> deeper<00:06:22.370> depth<00:06:22.610> of<00:06:22.730> field<00:06:22.970> than<00:06:23.540> I<00:06:23.600> would

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
much deeper depth of field than I would

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.110 
much deeper depth of field than I would
have<00:06:24.050> had<00:06:24.500> if<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:25.310> was<00:06:25.460> shooting<00:06:25.730> a<00:06:25.820> single

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
have had if I was shooting a single

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.120 
have had if I was shooting a single
image<00:06:26.360> as<00:06:26.660> I<00:06:27.080> said<00:06:27.260> there's<00:06:27.410> an<00:06:27.530> automatic<00:06:27.860> way

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
image as I said there's an automatic way

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.440 
image as I said there's an automatic way
of<00:06:28.250> doing<00:06:28.490> this<00:06:28.610> and<00:06:28.670> there<00:06:28.970> are<00:06:29.000> lots<00:06:29.300> of

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
of doing this and there are lots of

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.030 
of doing this and there are lots of
different<00:06:29.720> ways<00:06:29.780> of<00:06:29.930> working<00:06:30.110> with<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.590> and

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
different ways of working with that and

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.320 
different ways of working with that and
we're<00:06:31.130> gonna<00:06:31.220> spend<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:31.550> rest<00:06:31.730> of<00:06:31.940> this
