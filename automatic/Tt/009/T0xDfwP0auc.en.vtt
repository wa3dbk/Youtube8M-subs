00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 the exhibition complex will not 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.310
 overflow because of a huge crowd of people 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.080
 however not only people reporters 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.999

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.640
 famous developer Leonard Boyarsky 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.150
 the author of such hits as fallout and fallout 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.890
 2 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.110
 true he immediately warned that not 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.390
 is related to michael 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.380

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.360
 ask this puppy and canal this 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.189
 the moment is equal every time I give 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.770
 interview with someone from eastern europe 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.230
 I am not asked if we are relatives 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.510
 your boyars had to read about him 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.400
 wikipedia he's a famous singer and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.620
 actor before the benchmark sauce to humanity 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.790
 threatened by the sky gods maltael 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.250
 he was once 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.850
 the archangel of wisdom and in the souls of men 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.760
 telling 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.010
 now he takes the soul being 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.390
 the archangel of death until humanity is 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.140
 will disappear from the face of the earth 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.510
 sense of duty he believes it will 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.620
 better for his peace 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.810
 because people are too unpredictable in 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.590
 Reper souls appear brand new 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.630
 hero class 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 Here is a spectacular crusader us 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.100
 I wanted to make a character that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 fought in the middle distance barbarian for 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.730
 the melee in the game has a wizard for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 ranged too 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.420
 and one that gap between them and the 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.550
 fill the crusader 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 which has many medium range attacks 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.990
 while it looks like 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.600
 relies on physical strength he 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.940
 heavy armor it is massive so when 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.350
 crusader attack seems like he 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.350
 pounding the enemy straight in the face 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.670

 psionic attack on orcs heroes of 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.109
 the storm combines role-playing elements and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.719
 strategy elements and target audience 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.299
 people with a good sense of humor who are not 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.939

 conflict of people and orcs 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.519
 it looks like 80 level elves 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.430
 there is nothing to be pumped over 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.129
