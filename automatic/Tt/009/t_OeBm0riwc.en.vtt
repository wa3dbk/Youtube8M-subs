update video for my channel because I

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.170 
update video for my channel because I
know<00:00:23.020> you<00:00:23.170> all<00:00:23.740> must<00:00:23.980> be<00:00:24.070> wondering<00:00:24.550> why<00:00:25.150> I

know you all must be wondering why I
haven't<00:00:25.450> been<00:00:25.630> uploading<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.410> video<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.250> that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
haven't been uploading a video and that

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.910 
haven't been uploading a video and that
is<00:00:28.330> because<00:00:28.480> we<00:00:28.930> are<00:00:29.050> currently<00:00:29.320> only<00:00:29.650> another

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
is because we are currently only another

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.200 
is because we are currently only another
gravity<00:00:30.340> falls<00:00:30.550> hiatus<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.850> not<00:00:34.030> come

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
gravity falls hiatus and I have not come

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.180 
gravity falls hiatus and I have not come
up<00:00:34.330> with<00:00:34.360> any<00:00:34.600> new<00:00:34.930> theories<00:00:35.380> recently<00:00:35.860> to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
up with any new theories recently to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.230 
up with any new theories recently to
upload<00:00:36.670> but<00:00:37.180> if<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.510> do<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.720> will<00:00:37.900> upload<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:39.240> video

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
upload but if I do I will upload a video

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.300 
upload but if I do I will upload a video
about<00:00:40.630> that<00:00:40.960> theory<00:00:41.320> but<00:00:41.680> yeah<00:00:42.010> we're<00:00:42.220> all

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
about that theory but yeah we're all

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.760 
about that theory but yeah we're all
needed<00:00:42.730> a<00:00:42.880> hiatus<00:00:43.420> from<00:00:43.420> gravity<00:00:43.870> falls<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.320> a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
needed a hiatus from gravity falls and a

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.260 
needed a hiatus from gravity falls and a
lot<00:00:44.950> of<00:00:45.010> you<00:00:45.250> I've<00:00:45.579> been<00:00:45.790> getting<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.060> lot<00:00:46.210> of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
gravity falls gonna be and um no one

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.710 
gravity falls gonna be and um no one
knows<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.680> exact<00:00:53.980> date<00:00:54.220> but<00:00:54.490> Alex<00:00:55.240> first<00:00:55.480> said

knows the exact date but Alex first said

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.110 
knows the exact date but Alex first said
it<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.410> going<00:00:56.830> to<00:00:57.100> be<00:00:57.130> returning<00:00:57.790> during<00:00:58.030> the

returning I don't know how light into
June<00:01:04.650> um<00:01:05.650> hopefully<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.369> would<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
June um hopefully it would be the

June um hopefully it would be the
beginning<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:08.590> usually<00:01:08.710> after

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
beginning of you because usually after

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.120 
beginning of you because usually after
hiatus<00:01:09.549> that's<00:01:09.759> win<00:01:10.030> um<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.570> new<00:01:11.470> episode<00:01:11.799> is<00:01:11.950> at

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
hiatus that's win um a new episode is at

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.070 
hiatus that's win um a new episode is at
the<00:01:12.250> beginning<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.759> month<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:13.720> hopefully

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
the beginning of the month so hopefully

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.359 
the beginning of the month so hopefully
that<00:01:14.229> is<00:01:14.259> when<00:01:14.530> we're<00:01:14.680> getting<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.920> new<00:01:14.950> episode

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
that is when we're getting a new episode

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
that is when we're getting a new episode
and<00:01:15.549> he<00:01:15.729> also<00:01:15.939> said<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:18.040> interview<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.479> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and he also said in an interview that if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.889 
and he also said in an interview that if
people<00:01:21.009> enjoyed<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.579> first<00:01:21.759> half<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.719> season

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
people enjoyed the first half of season

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.419 
people enjoyed the first half of season
2<00:01:23.200> gravity<00:01:23.619> falls<00:01:23.829> they're<00:01:24.100> gonna<00:01:24.219> have<00:01:24.399> their

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
2 gravity falls they're gonna have their

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.760 
2 gravity falls they're gonna have their
face<00:01:24.759> melted<00:01:25.149> off<00:01:25.179> website<00:01:25.630> now<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.499> it's

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
face melted off website now so it's

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.130 
face melted off website now so it's
going<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.070> be<00:01:27.130> well<00:01:27.429> worth<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.729> wait<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.299> um

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
going to be well worth the wait I um

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to be well worth the wait I um
have<00:01:29.920> some<00:01:30.189> theories<00:01:30.369> about<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.819> next

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
have some theories about the next

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.349 
have some theories about the next
episode<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.539> think<00:01:31.780> it's<00:01:32.289> going<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.740> be<00:01:32.859> about

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
episode I think it's going to be about

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.270 
episode I think it's going to be about
similar<00:01:34.359> to<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.539> part<00:01:34.869> 2<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.170> nobody<00:01:35.829> seems<00:01:36.069> but

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
similar to a part 2 of nobody seems but

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.849 
similar to a part 2 of nobody seems but
not<00:01:36.460> exactly<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.149> part<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.659> its<00:01:38.350> going<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.829> just

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
not exactly a part to its going to just

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.550 
not exactly a part to its going to just
um<00:01:39.280> be<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> follow-up<00:01:40.390> episode<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.380> we're<00:01:41.469> gonna

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
um be a follow-up episode so we're gonna

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.529 
um be a follow-up episode so we're gonna
find<00:01:41.829> out<00:01:41.979> what<00:01:42.130> happens<00:01:42.429> next<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.389> it's

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
find out what happens next so it's

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.940 
find out what happens next so it's
basically<00:01:43.689> like<00:01:44.079> a<00:01:44.139> part<00:01:44.409> 2<00:01:44.560> but<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.799> don't

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
basically like a part 2 but I don't

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.529 
basically like a part 2 but I don't
think<00:01:45.069> it's<00:01:45.189> actually<00:01:45.520> gonna<00:01:45.609> be<00:01:45.670> not<00:01:46.329> really

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
think it's actually gonna be not really

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.319 
think it's actually gonna be not really
seems<00:01:46.749> part<00:01:47.079> 2<00:01:47.200> something<00:01:47.649> like<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.179> is<00:01:49.179> if

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
seems part 2 something like that is if

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.849 
seems part 2 something like that is if
that<00:01:49.479> was<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.689> case<00:01:49.719> then<00:01:50.079> nobody<00:01:50.619> seems

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
that was the case then nobody seems

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.029 
that was the case then nobody seems
would<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.399> they<00:01:51.639> had<00:01:51.819> a<00:01:51.850> bin<00:01:52.179> cold<00:01:52.539> part<00:01:52.780> 1<00:01:53.039> so

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
would have they had a bin cold part 1 so

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.219 
would have they had a bin cold part 1 so
um<00:01:54.340> that's<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.210> for<00:01:55.389> this<00:01:55.479> little<00:01:55.659> video<00:01:55.869> just

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
um that's it for this little video just

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.899 
um that's it for this little video just
want<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.499> make<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.799> you<00:01:56.889> guys<00:01:57.100> thanks<00:01:57.639> so<00:01:57.759> much
