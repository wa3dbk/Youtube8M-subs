00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello everyone today i would like you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.889
 tell about the slider means I 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 put on a motorcycle 4 slider each 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:21.510
 on the side of 2 means it is clear yes here is one 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 and here is the second one that countries also 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 symmetrically how i did it so our u 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 slider large universal for 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:46.200
 light motorcycle mean this slider 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:51.320
 Standard motor mount 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.320
 place of motor mount except 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 I had to cut a small plastic 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:07.860
 problem to cut plastic 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:16.189
 so this means for the top 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 slider and bottom slider mean here 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.590
 standard is such with her piece of iron 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.470
 screwed to the engine 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.970
 but conditionally you can call the detail here 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 number nineteen she serves principle 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 like a factory slide 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 to keep the insides under this 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.860
 caps because it is flush 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 ends with a cover well, so conditionally 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.619
 Of course all this and to them to this one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.509
 I welded the details 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.460
 slider mount 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.850
 and put the slider the other way on 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.850
 the other side 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.060
 it turns out there is no 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:12.900
 pieces of iron yes she goes to one side i 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.350
 20 millimeters arched from the rod and brought 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.660
 here 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 fasten the slider to it screwed 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 slider and this slider drowned a little what 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.390
 with so much stuck out principle is easy 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.600
 regulated you can push forward on 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.810
 about 15 millimeters still here also 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:41.970
 set the top slider on the same 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:46.350
 Engine mounting method patients 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 In principle, there are no problems with installing 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.970
 I did not have reliability 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.350
 This design of course must itself 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.520
 show at the first drop bye 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.020
 the motorcycle has not yet fallen and che sliders 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.760
 needed for what yes first of all to 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.860
 hurt the bike as little as possible 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.140
 Someone thinks that in general so that he does not 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.700
 suffered principle 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.380
 countries he will suffer any there before 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.010
 way to be scratched somewhere or else 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.040
 something plastic can and well times and 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.310
 break completely when falling a 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.640
 slider as it makes it fall 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.700
 by far 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:38.570
 to have less damage to the motorcycle 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.209
 Well, why did I do to the top and bottom 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.510
 sliders I like plastic principle 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.640
 pretty easy to buy without it 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.010
 you can move around a little 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:58.920
 problem but if it hurts hurt 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.170
 engine covers and insides up to 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.420
 engine then it's more of a problem 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.420
 there will be parts 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.090
 it is to wait and order accordingly 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.100
 I will do nothing so I did everything 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:24.150
 for safety exactly 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.470
 engines tried to do this in 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:33.590
 Basically it turned out pretty 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:37.820
 nice on so the motorcycle look up 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.820
 principle, they are not very bulging 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.540
 looks decent 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:57.420
 she's quite so guys if you want 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.710
 You can also install everything for sale 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.670
 cheap sliders are getting 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.670
 standard places
