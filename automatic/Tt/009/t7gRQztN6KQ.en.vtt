00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.730
 of the pin on which the fixing is to be made 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.770
 check which is the right direction of the capsule to place it directly on the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 remove the cotton roll previously inserted between the cheek 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.189
 and the gum 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 and place it on the fixed capsule 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.569
