00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
probably backwards hmm why are we having

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.859 
probably backwards hmm why are we having
difficulties<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.640> was<00:02:09.149> backwards<00:02:09.390> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
difficulties now but it was backwards it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.680 
difficulties now but it was backwards it
was

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.790 

alright<00:02:15.690> let<00:02:15.870> me<00:02:15.930> set<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> counter<00:02:16.470> down<00:02:16.620> for

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.070 
alright let me set the counter down for
a<00:02:16.830> second<00:02:20.390> alright<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.420> guess<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.020> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
a second alright I guess that was a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.900 
a second alright I guess that was a
two-hand<00:02:22.440> job<00:02:22.650> okay<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.400> plugged<00:02:23.760> in
