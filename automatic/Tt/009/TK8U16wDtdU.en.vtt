00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
still had the code but apparently not

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.820 
still had the code but apparently not
wait<00:05:20.260> maybe<00:05:21.990> maybe<00:05:22.990> this<00:05:23.230> is<00:05:23.350> just<00:05:23.560> like<00:05:23.710> the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
wait maybe maybe this is just like the

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.530 
wait maybe maybe this is just like the
old<00:05:23.860> code<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.490> don't<00:05:24.730> know<00:05:24.790> I'm<00:05:24.940> confused

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
old code I don't know I'm confused

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.510 
old code I don't know I'm confused
well<00:05:26.200> it<00:05:26.380> was<00:05:26.530> from<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.800> thirst<00:05:27.010> or<00:05:27.190> so<00:05:27.340> maybe

they<00:05:27.670> just<00:05:27.790> took<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.210> code<00:05:28.360> out<00:05:28.390> except<00:05:28.780> I

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
they just took the code out except I

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.000 
they just took the code out except I
don't<00:05:28.990> really<00:05:29.200> know<00:05:29.350> how<00:05:29.500> because<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.830> still
