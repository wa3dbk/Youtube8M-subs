00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.879
 Hello, as I already told you in the 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.269
 previous video this is going to be a series 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.220
 of short videos where the intention 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.590
 is to propose elements for you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.439
 go building yourself as a better 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 person and well let's start talking 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.349
 of this being a person that wants 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.349
 tell you that surely you have heard 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.650
 the everyday issues that all 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.350
 we are people so let me tell you 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.370
 not the fact that we have the figure 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.850
 human means that we are people to be 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.629
 person 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.450
 supposes a series of construction that the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.239
 same subject that the same being 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.660
 human is doing throughout his life 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.570
 and this construction is precisely the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.729
 made by integrating a series of 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.479
 values ​​on all human values 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.540
 universal that are making you go 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.479
 configuring as a person that is 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 we can have the human appearance and not 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.550
 I can have the human appearance 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.160
 we are necessarily people all 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.450
 we have the possibility and right now I 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:33.000
 you can give the reason without a doubt you know 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 human beings who are very sociable that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 They are very acomedido that are very 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.789
 responsible and others who also have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 the human figure that are loose they are 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.929
 very isolated work you hear the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.149
 two have the human figure but this 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:55.049
 person who is responsible who is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.149
 sociable is precisely working in 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.420
 that of the integration of values ​​in 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.240
 his being that's why he's setting himself up as 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.090
 person that is the great project all 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.549
 we are destined to that all at 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.140
 throughout life we ​​are integrating in 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:17.010
 our person values ​​values that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.210
 without a doubt we are becoming better beings 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.330
 humans we could not say that 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.640
 and someone who is perfect no one in 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
 this life achieves perfection as such 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.700
 but the ideal is that as long as you 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 you are living that you are making yourself a 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 biggest year you can say with all 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.250
 security that you are better and being better 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.920
 it means that you are strengthening your 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.870
 life from the values because the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.500
 insistence of values ​​because in the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.400
 values ​​correspond to your essence 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.050
 unfortunately we have a vastness 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.240
 of information that is rather 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.910
 disinformation through TV to 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.550
 through all the all means that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.160
 they sell you a life project or a 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.350
 human being project someone who is 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.110
 successful they also sell you an idea of 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.410
 success and I want to tell you something very 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.500
 important the truly successful is 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.260
 the one who manages to connect with his 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.990
 essence and we only connect with 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.750
 our own essence from that 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.630
 we recognize that the only way to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 build us as better people are 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.950
 human values 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.950
 see you later
