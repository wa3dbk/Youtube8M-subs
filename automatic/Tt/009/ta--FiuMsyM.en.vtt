for<00:00:12.300> tutorial<00:00:12.750> oh<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> bit

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
for tutorial oh this one is a bit

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.499 
for tutorial oh this one is a bit
different<00:00:13.950> than<00:00:14.009> usual<00:00:14.150> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.240> quite<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.450> few

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
different than usual we have quite a few

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.609 
different than usual we have quite a few
questions<00:00:15.690> regarding<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> gravity<00:00:16.440> train

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
questions regarding the gravity train

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.779 
questions regarding the gravity train
shown<00:00:16.859> at<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> end<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> our<00:00:17.190> trade<00:00:17.430> zones<00:00:17.640> in

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789

gravity<00:00:18.090> volumes<00:00:18.359> tutorial<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.410> video

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
gravity volumes tutorial so this video

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.900 
gravity volumes tutorial so this video
would<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> breakdown<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.220> how<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.550> gravity

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
would be a breakdown of how our gravity

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
would be a breakdown of how our gravity
train<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.210> created<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.650> Train<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> set<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
train was created the Train is set up so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.529 
train was created the Train is set up so
that<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> hit<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.880> button<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> extract

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that when I hit the button to extract

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
that when I hit the button to extract
site<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.199> train<00:00:25.859> will<00:00:26.010> appear<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.430> then

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
site a the train will appear and then

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.890 
site a the train will appear and then
roll<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> tracks<00:00:27.210> before<00:00:27.420> disappearing

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
roll down the tracks before disappearing

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:42.560 
roll down the tracks before disappearing
into<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.320> tunnel<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> other<00:00:28.890> end

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 

so<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:43.679> go<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:43.890> forge<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.339> see<00:00:44.429> how<00:00:44.519> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
so let's go into forge and see how it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.270 
so let's go into forge and see how it
works<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> gravity<00:00:46.559> train<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.859> moved<00:00:47.039> by<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
works the gravity train is moved by a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.869 
works the gravity train is moved by a
line<00:00:47.519> of<00:00:47.670> gravity<00:00:47.789> zones<00:00:48.589> using<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.879> Tenten

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
line of gravity zones using the Tenten

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
line of gravity zones using the Tenten
invisible<00:00:51.480> zones<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.649> stack<00:00:52.859> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
invisible zones and actually stack on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.079 
invisible zones and actually stack on
top<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> each<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.729> them<00:00:53.879> strong

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
top of each other to make them strong

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.810 
top of each other to make them strong
enough<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.359> push<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.479> crates<00:00:54.979> and<00:00:55.979> I<00:00:56.550> use

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
enough to push the crates and I use

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.250 
enough to push the crates and I use
magnets<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> set<00:00:57.479> this<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.870> quickly

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
magnets to set this up really quickly

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.789 
magnets to set this up really quickly
just<00:00:59.329> straight<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.570> line<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.769> way

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
just straight down the line all the way

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:02.990 
just straight down the line all the way
down<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> tracks<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.549> falls<00:01:02.729> into<00:01:02.909> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
down the tracks then it falls into a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
down the tracks then it falls into a
hole<00:01:03.140> where<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> crates<00:01:05.039> will<00:01:05.159> fall<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hole where the crates will fall off the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.410 
hole where the crates will fall off the
map<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.240> respawn<00:01:06.659> later<00:01:08.149> now<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.210> game

site with only one site active as you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
site with only one site active as you
saw<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> set<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> instant<00:01:14.580> explosion

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
saw I had it set to instant explosion

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.040 
saw I had it set to instant explosion
that<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.300> train<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.539> pop<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.899> the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
that way the train would pop in the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.559 
that way the train would pop in the
moment<00:01:16.319> that<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.440> hold<00:01:16.590> down<00:01:16.740> X<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> column

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
moment that I hold down X on the column

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.999 
moment that I hold down X on the column
I'm<00:01:18.569> using<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:18.990> columns<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.530> an<00:01:19.619> extraction

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I'm using these columns as an extraction

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.730 
I'm using these columns as an extraction
object<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.179> can<00:01:21.300> use<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.740> structure

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
object so you can use any structure

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
object so you can use any structure
object<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.759> objective<00:01:24.720> piece<00:01:25.110> by<00:01:25.350> changing

object as a objective piece by changing

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.919 
object as a objective piece by changing
the<00:01:25.800> shape<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.250> giving<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> volume<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
the shape and giving it a volume so I

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.450 
the shape and giving it a volume so I
can<00:01:28.110> walk<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.350> within<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> circle<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> then

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
can walk up within that circle and then

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.870 
can walk up within that circle and then
hold<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.850> X<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.270> arm<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> site<00:01:31.880> spawn

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
setup video except we were just using

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:45.800 
setup video except we were just using
hill<00:01:44.759> markers<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.450> we're<00:01:45.569> using<00:01:45.690> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
hill markers then and we're using a

hill markers then and we're using a
column<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> case<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:47.789> other<00:01:47.910> column<00:01:48.239> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
column in this case the other column is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
column in this case the other column is
set<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.629> the<00:01:48.840> exact<00:01:49.140> same<00:01:49.349> the<00:01:49.649> only

set up the exact same the only

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.779 
set up the exact same the only
difference<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:52.190> bond<00:01:53.190> sequence<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
difference is that the bond sequence is

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.419 
difference is that the bond sequence is
set<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.030> two<00:01:54.239> making<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.869> site<00:01:55.140> b<00:01:55.319> it<00:01:56.220> doesn't

that detonates site b becomes available
and<00:02:00.959> that's<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.349> the<00:02:01.440> crates<00:02:01.679> spawn<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.039> to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
and that's when the crates spawn in to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.839 
and that's when the crates spawn in to
make<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> train<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.459> good<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.670> place<00:02:05.819> a

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
make the train so it's good in place a

name of the crate that I used was

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.680 
name of the crate that I used was
container<00:02:15.450> large<00:02:17.150> there's<00:02:18.150> also<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.390> container

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690

inside<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.610> Train<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.030> walk<00:02:21.180> around<00:02:21.480> while

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
inside the Train and walk around while

inside the Train and walk around while
it's<00:02:21.810> moving<00:02:22.110> down<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> tracks<00:02:22.560> pretty<00:02:22.920> cool

it's moving down the tracks pretty cool

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.100 
it's moving down the tracks pretty cool
so<00:02:26.069> I'm<00:02:26.129> going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.370> set<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.760> spawn<00:02:27.150> time<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.810> 30

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
so I'm going to set the spawn time to 30

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.500 
so I'm going to set the spawn time to 30
seconds<00:02:28.909> there's<00:02:29.909> some<00:02:30.030> issues<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.390> this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
seconds there's some issues of this

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.180 
seconds there's some issues of this
though<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.650> crates<00:02:32.040> don't

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
though because the crates don't

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.680 
though because the crates don't
disappear<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.670> exact<00:02:33.060> same<00:02:33.239> time<00:02:33.480> when

disappear all the exact same time when
they<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.870> down<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.080> track<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.040> what<00:02:35.159> ends<00:02:35.310> up

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
they go down the track so what ends up

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.009 
they go down the track so what ends up
happening<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.940> they'll<00:02:36.239> spawn<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.750> they'll<00:02:36.930> be

track on its own this IV ously isn't
good<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.909> want<00:03:09.030> replace<00:03:09.239> 2<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.540> 3<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.780> them

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
good if you want replace 2 or 3 of them

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.149 
good if you want replace 2 or 3 of them
and<00:03:10.049> had<00:03:10.140> them<00:03:10.260> rolling<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.709> sync<00:03:10.950> with<00:03:11.040> each

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
and had them rolling in sync with each

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.420 
and had them rolling in sync with each
other<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.540> set<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.810> physics<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.319> fixed<00:03:13.829> and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
other so I set the physics to fixed and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.890 
other so I set the physics to fixed and
then<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.760> placed<00:03:15.000> all<00:03:15.090> my<00:03:15.239> crates<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.629> track

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
then I placed all my crates on the track

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.890 
then I placed all my crates on the track
and<00:03:16.230> then<00:03:16.920> I'll<00:03:17.280> go<00:03:17.549> back<00:03:17.909> and<00:03:18.510> change<00:03:18.750> them

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and then I'll go back and change them

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.990 
and then I'll go back and change them
all<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.140> normal<00:03:19.440> really<00:03:19.650> quickly<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.879> they

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
all to normal really quickly so they

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.309 
all to normal really quickly so they
start<00:03:21.209> rolling<00:03:21.329> down<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.629> track<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> then

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
start rolling down the track and then

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.100 
start rolling down the track and then
save<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> map<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.510> kind<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.959> hassle

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
save the map this is kind of a hassle

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.339 
save the map this is kind of a hassle
but<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:26.069> makes<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.819> crates<00:03:27.659> spawn

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
but it makes it so that the crates spawn

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.710 
but it makes it so that the crates spawn
improperly<00:03:28.890> when<00:03:29.099> they<00:03:29.160> come<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.720> there's

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
improperly when they come in and there's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.470 
improperly when they come in and there's
no<00:03:30.840> big<00:03:31.049> gaps<00:03:31.290> between<00:03:31.440> them<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> I'll<00:03:36.209> do<00:03:36.390> is

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
no big gaps between them so I'll do is

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.550 
no big gaps between them so I'll do is
line<00:03:36.599> up<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:36.959> as<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.829> can<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:38.129> not<00:03:39.000> moving

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
line up here as you can see not moving

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.360 
line up here as you can see not moving
then<00:03:40.560> when<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.709> switch<00:03:40.890> them<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.040> normal

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
then when I switch them to normal

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.440 
then when I switch them to normal
they're<00:03:41.489> still<00:03:41.760> not<00:03:41.849> going<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> move<00:03:42.209> down<00:03:42.329> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
they're still not going to move down the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.479 
they're still not going to move down the
tracks<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:43.170> have<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> actually<00:03:43.650> select<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.890 
tracks you have to actually select the
object<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:44.970> then<00:03:45.090> let<00:03:45.269> go<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.569> order<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.810> make

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
object and then let go in order to make

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.089 
object and then let go in order to make
a<00:03:45.930> move<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:49.079> if<00:03:49.200> you're<00:03:49.319> really<00:03:49.530> quick<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:49.890> this

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
a move so if you're really quick on this

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.729 
a move so if you're really quick on this
then<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.579> can<00:03:50.670> get<00:03:50.819> it<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.000> work<00:03:51.150> pretty<00:03:51.480> well

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
then you can get it to work pretty well

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:02.569 
then you can get it to work pretty well
and<00:03:52.739> safe<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.470> that's<00:03:58.829> it<00:04:00.590> now<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.650> crates

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
and safe and that's it now the crates

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.309 
and safe and that's it now the crates
are<00:04:02.639> rolled<00:04:02.819> on<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.940> track<00:04:03.239> that's<00:04:04.079> pretty

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
are rolled on the track that's pretty

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.479 
are rolled on the track that's pretty
cool<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.590> sound<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.010> metal<00:04:05.280> on<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
cool the sound of the metal on the

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.740 
cool the sound of the metal on the
tracks<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:05.880> makes<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.299> kind<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.540> sound

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
tracks actually makes it kind of sound

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.839 
tracks actually makes it kind of sound
