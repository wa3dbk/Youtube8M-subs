00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
that you first need to stop your server

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.339 
that you first need to stop your server
and<00:00:10.969> then<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.300> look<00:00:12.509> at<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.809> field<00:00:13.110> right

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
and then if you look at this field right

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.099 
and then if you look at this field right
here<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.679> says<00:00:13.740> world<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.820> blank<00:00:15.179> this

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
here that says world it's blank this

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.680 
here that says world it's blank this
means<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.710> server<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.369> currently<00:00:17.940> loading<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
means your server is currently loading a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.970 
means your server is currently loading a
world<00:00:19.109> cold<00:00:19.920> world<00:00:21.529> even<00:00:22.529> though<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
world cold world even though this is

world cold world even though this is
blank<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> defaults<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.939> so<00:00:26.939> if

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
blank this is what it defaults to so if

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.799 
blank this is what it defaults to so if
you<00:00:27.890> access<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.010> servers<00:00:29.490> files<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.660> will

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you access your servers files you will

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
you access your servers files you will
see<00:00:34.020> these<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.770> worlds<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.880> is

your<00:00:36.239> main<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> let's<00:00:38.370> say<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.550> wanted

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
your main one but let's say you wanted

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
your main one but let's say you wanted
to<00:00:39.000> upload<00:00:39.300> something<00:00:40.020> else<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.520> order<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
to upload something else so in order to
do<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.510> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.379> download<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
do that you need to download it to your

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.420 
do that you need to download it to your
computer<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.559> anarchic<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
computer first and an anarchic if it's a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
computer first and an anarchic if it's a
dot<00:00:47.640> zip<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> dot<00:00:48.539> R<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.739> world

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
dot zip or a dot R so it's just a world

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.670 
dot zip or a dot R so it's just a world
folder<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.870> navigate<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.530> where

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
folder and then you navigate to where

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
folder and then you navigate to where
you<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> stored<00:00:53.280> Minds<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:53.940> desktop

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you have it stored Minds in my desktop

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.040 
you have it stored Minds in my desktop
and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:56.010> minecraft<00:00:56.550> folder<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:01:00.050> here

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and then minecraft folder and then here

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.479

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the world it's going to load so now you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
the world it's going to load so now you
start<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.259> server<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.460> now

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
start your server and then because now

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.300 
start your server and then because now
this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.299> main<00:02:00.450> world<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.770> also<00:02:02.040> going

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
this is your main world it's also going

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
this is your main world it's also going

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
to create survival nether and survival

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
to create survival nether and survival
the<00:02:05.640> end<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.689> server

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the end so if you go to your server

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.069 
the end so if you go to your server
files<00:02:08.030> once<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.270> finally<00:02:10.050> loads

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.459 

eat<00:02:16.079> in<00:02:16.290> refresh<00:02:17.719> you<00:02:18.719> will<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:19.109> now<00:02:19.260> there's

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
eat in refresh you will see now there's

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.000 
eat in refresh you will see now there's
a<00:02:19.730> survival<00:02:20.730> survival<00:02:21.209> nether<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.010> survival

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
a survival survival nether and survival

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
a survival survival nether and survival
the<00:02:23.129> end<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.629> as<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.840> main<00:02:25.019> world<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.590> now

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the end and as the main world right now

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.819 
the end and as the main world right now
it's<00:02:26.099> running<00:02:26.640> survival<00:02:27.379> so<00:02:28.379> basically

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
it's running survival so basically
