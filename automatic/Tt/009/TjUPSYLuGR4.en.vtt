 the installation of the electric key plate 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.950
 for crepes should be installed over 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.660
 materials are never 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.660
 install the plate less than 15

 coated with a PVC protection 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.630
 therefore remove all protection from pvc 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.400
 before using the custom equipment 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.739
 safety and efficiency of your 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.470
 equipment is recommended to connect the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.410
 ground wire 2.5 mm 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.170
 ground wire should not be connected to the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.230
 neutral network of water pipes and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.209
 gas networks etc. 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.760
 before connecting the club to the power grid 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.160
 make sure that the electrical installation 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.950
 your property the same 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.680
 indicated on the label affixed to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.200
 equipment 127 220 volts turning button 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.489
 positioning thermostat at the temperature 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.670
 desired 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.829
 the temperature control is performed 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.489
 through the thermostat on and off 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.170
 resistances automatically keeping 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.109
 the desired temperature 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.709
 the pilot light indicates the process 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.989
 connects and disconnects the thermostat awaiting 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.989
 approximately 15 minutes to the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.010
 preheat the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.860
 always with a brass brush 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.280
 clean and grease the plates with margarine 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.909
 using a brush your equipment 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.209
 is ready for use 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.450
 Important tips do not install the unit 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.940
 near heat-sensitive materials 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.549
 plates should be a tapas whenever 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.010
 are used and cleaning must be 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.229
 when used for 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.370
 prevent it from being left with residues 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.400
 accumulated 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.270
 the equipment should not be installed in 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.220
 situations that gets inbuilt cleaning and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.620
 conservation 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.729
 do not use water when cleaning the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 equipment 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.770
 the cleaning must be done with equipment 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.470
 off and cold 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.690
 use a brass brush and brush to 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.440
 cleaning 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.440
 never use products
