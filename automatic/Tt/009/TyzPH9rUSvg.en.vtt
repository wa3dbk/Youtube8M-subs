 idol only pro thanks we see 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.510
 in front of a person who is not something that is not 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.449
 endeavored to become cult 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.309

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.000
 very black bad envy 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 because kinchev fingers wider for 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.659

 flog credit 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.130
 it is only a human gesture 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 thankful 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 something like a kinchev sculptor now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 sarcastically the question why the whole album despite 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.260
 the fact that all actions from the texts 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.630
 and draws an analogy scene 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.619
 with the blessed memory of brodsky loans 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.380
 companies there and so on why is everyone 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.730
 albums when they listened at a concert 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.240
 here is the atmosphere giving and however for good 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.020
 further because such and should 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.509
 be equipped with 3 houses 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.240
 can not hear l 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 when i asked the monsters project 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.299
 maybe those who need to ask bases 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.970
 aizenshpisa they start 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.840
 conspiratorial insight into this 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 some kind of musical move because it's such 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.010
 here's the music 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.610
 they don't know and even respond to him and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.330
 so r 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.960
 this stage and rock music at which the drum 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.940
 should sound louder than text percent 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.420
 volunteer whatever it is but I listened 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.939
 I wanted to listen so that sings Constantin 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.159
 why do you have all the albums like this I don't 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.209
 heard acoustic only selectively 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.790
 Chelsea where glory I can not hear the words toastmaster 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.649
 music 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.849
 how did you record his choice did not give to drink 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.760
 water from the studio 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.879
 survey conducted through a hole in the blood 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.040
 no album know up to no not often 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.019
 it's not true faryab I understand him in 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.450
 first when when I as an employer 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.480
 should listen only music i steps on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.530
 the stage wards heard the same I understood 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 I accept my fault in this probably yes 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 really guilty but when it goes 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.009
 this work 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.649
 so the percentage is getting up 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:41.769
 you can not listen to these songs already 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.339
 because you have invested a lot in the world 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.389
 immersed in at the moment of introduction 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.499
 specific depressions times he swept from me 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:49.999
 not 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.519
 homeless her just no I don't want to have an obedient 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.249
 pride again 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:56.059
 Here I am part of the drive 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.539
 he is not so disgusted with my voice 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:59.499
 here at this moment 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.939
 what's his two games 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.859
 and the time passes the berry 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.299
 start thinking leapfrog really everything to me 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.919
 they said it was not enough 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.499
 probably mean score but already visited 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.579
 in year 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.549
 the chairman is the problem of the doctor 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.869
 speak as it is 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.499
 that is, it can show that veres 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.299
 there really is rock like this 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.889
 Text can be published as a separate book. 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.300
 jazz album here's the text 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 the text itself 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.970
 he loses from it does he have the right to be 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.959
 issued model 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.209
 how writing writers foresee
