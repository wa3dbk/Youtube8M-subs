00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 welcome to shizanuty review with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.730
 you nikitos let's discuss well in general 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.880
 such an epic chapter so want it 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.370
 see in the anime how damn when he 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.130
 hit him first time 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.970
 he is so deep in the earth is gone 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 the style is the same but I was surprised that his 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.720
 technique yes he says five steps to and he 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 first took the first step at the very beginning 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.090
 chapters 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.900
 and then time passed and he began again with 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.480
 first step 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.579
 well how strange but oh well the pain 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 unbearable and in general he suffers as a drain 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 the sca team operated to help him 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 that is, I did not expect I thought that guy 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.129
 now it will be easy to fight him because 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.050
 well, only taijutsu can 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.719
 resist 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.899
 madara oh well or the son of son duchi chakra we 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.120
 it already know about the guy turns out now 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 the strongest taijutsu shinobi in the world 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.969
 it turns out damn and then they could him 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.479
 help if not for them he would not break through 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.870
 protection and fuck it fucking there that I could 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.730
 the sixth gate open 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.530
 it turns out he can morning peacock 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.390
 use further as cool as 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.970
 cool this whole timing is 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.730
 tension here damn it would be me in 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.700
 slow motion without music know 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.340
 when everything froze and only these 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.380
 actions like this fled threw kunai 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.720
 appeared min from a took these areas 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.570
 but I did not understand he will die there with something 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.420
 these spheres it turns out and we 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.700
 used on approach and he broke it 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.700
 and when he breaks it he flies 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.700
 get offended hurt and got turns 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.980
 how did he go all over the land this 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.410
 awesome from that angle like kakashi 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.770
 she sits it looks just awesome 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.800
 it is awesome that when got out on an example 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.320
 from the hole of madar he is of such a type what is it well 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.630
 recognized by force that it is not for everyone 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.940
 will happen in life to fight with such 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.950
 shinobi who 8 glad opened this honor 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.739
 for me let's fight as it should 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.840
 began to take him seriously and when 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.610
 opponent of this level against madara 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.600
 Madara rejoice and enjoy 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.350
 from the battle 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.790
 great and when it still struck and 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.950
 he had a hard time, he still 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.900
 by the way stayed alive this guy 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 surprised and what to do now all 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 be afraid to die turns out he also 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.550
 there is nothing damn tin well I hope he has 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.380
 there is some trump card as madara says 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.300
 or something else guys coming up 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.640
 but at least what we saw naruto 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.250
 woke up which means he will have an hour of strength 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.230
 and they have already given the missing parts 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.160
 dzhinchuriki so most likely naruto 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.769
 receive power Rikudo Sanin but possible 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.560
 Inter had a revolver or will 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.590
 he will be equal to the power of smurd and or else 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.230
 I don't know something, but we'll see naruto 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.060
 I woke up and something so will see you 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.130
 I hope nothing in the next chapter 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.200
 missed 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.700
 well cool great bunch of all that 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.950
 epic occur especially when he 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.020
 he was hit and the explosion was like on Hiroshima 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.810
 so much there is just scale 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.280
 this is something comparable not know he would 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.100
 could this blow seem to me a guru and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.930
 lower as absolute susara madara 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.030
 oh well see you next chapter 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.030
 I hope you are just as awesome
