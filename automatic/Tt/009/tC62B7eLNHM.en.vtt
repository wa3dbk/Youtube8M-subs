00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
much and I was wondering if you could

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.850 
much and I was wondering if you could
stick<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.550> right<00:01:16.580> on<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.940> enemy<00:01:17.240> spawn<00:01:17.510> and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
stick it right on the enemy spawn and

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.500 
stick it right on the enemy spawn and
and<00:01:18.860> watch<00:01:19.070> what<00:01:19.310> happens<00:01:19.640> there<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.300> what<00:01:20.480> I

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
flipping the spawn over here it's easy

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.950

fight<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.480> I'm<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.140> by<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.410> by<00:02:27.620> watching<00:02:27.770> this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
fight so I'm so by it by watching this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.460 
fight so I'm so by it by watching this
my<00:02:28.700> conclusion<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.420> look<00:02:29.570> there's<00:02:29.810> those

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
my conclusion and look there's those

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.810 
my conclusion and look there's those
guys<00:02:30.740> just<00:02:30.770> fought<00:02:31.190> in<00:02:31.310> front<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.550> my<00:02:31.640> camera

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
guys just fought in front of my camera

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.010 
guys just fought in front of my camera
too<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:32.510> killed<00:02:32.720> me

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
too and then killed me

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.440 
too and then killed me
so<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.380> conclusion<00:02:33.590> after<00:02:34.370> watching<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.060> is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
so my conclusion after watching this is

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.600 
so my conclusion after watching this is
that<00:02:35.930> dropping<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.680> camera<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> spawn<00:02:37.580> point

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
that dropping a camera on a spawn point

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.820 
that dropping a camera on a spawn point
does<00:02:38.330> not<00:02:38.360> stop<00:02:38.900> them<00:02:39.110> from<00:02:39.230> spawning<00:02:39.590> right

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
does not stop them from spawning right

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.310 
does not stop them from spawning right
in<00:02:39.980> front<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.780> quick<00:02:42.140> tip

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.699 
in front of it that's that's quick tip
number<00:02:42.500> two<00:02:43.390> now<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> last<00:02:44.810> quick<00:02:45.110> tip<00:02:45.320> comes

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
number two now the last quick tip comes

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.710

I<00:02:59.930> read<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.470> reddit<00:03:00.650> com<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.730> it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
I read this on reddit com that it

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.580 
I read this on reddit com that it
doesn't<00:03:02.180> count<00:03:02.300> as<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> loss<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.170> not<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.350> win

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
doesn't count as a loss it's not a win

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.710 
doesn't count as a loss it's not a win
but<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.250> doesn't<00:03:04.489> count<00:03:04.580> as<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> loss<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.690> I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
but it doesn't count as a loss so I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.150 
but it doesn't count as a loss so I
thought<00:03:05.930> huh<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.380> know<00:03:06.440> I'll<00:03:06.530> jump<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.950> game

count<00:03:17.720> as<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> loss<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:18.410> there<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.280> is<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.580> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
count as a loss so there it is if you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.760

your<00:03:25.580> combat<00:03:26.090> record<00:03:26.239> having<00:03:26.780> said<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.140> I've

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
your combat record having said that I've

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.080 
your combat record having said that I've
read<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:27.890> multiple<00:03:28.310> sources<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:28.940> been

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
read in multiple sources and it's been

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330 
read in multiple sources and it's been
confirmed<00:03:29.420> all<00:03:29.660> over<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.650> getting<00:03:30.980> second

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
confirmed all over that getting second

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550 
confirmed all over that getting second
and<00:03:31.430> third<00:03:31.610> doesn't<00:03:32.060> end<00:03:32.299> your<00:03:32.480> win<00:03:32.690> streak<00:03:33.080> so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
and third doesn't end your win streak so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.870 
and third doesn't end your win streak so
while<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.920> may<00:03:34.010> be<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.190> loss<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.489> your<00:03:34.640> record

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
while it may be a loss on your record

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.490 
while it may be a loss on your record
you<00:03:34.940> win<00:03:35.090> streak<00:03:35.299> keeps<00:03:35.510> going<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.290> same

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you win streak keeps going in the same

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.530 
you win streak keeps going in the same
way<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.160> dashboarding<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:38.299> know<00:03:38.390> it

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
way that in dashboarding you know it

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.940 
way that in dashboarding you know it
counts<00:03:38.690> as<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.930> loss<00:03:39.080> on<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:39.290> record<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:39.860> it

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
counts as a loss on your record but it

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.160 
counts as a loss on your record but it
doesn't<00:03:40.250> end<00:03:40.340> your<00:03:40.489> win<00:03:40.670> streak<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.810> hope

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
doesn't end your win streak so I hope

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.390 
doesn't end your win streak so I hope
