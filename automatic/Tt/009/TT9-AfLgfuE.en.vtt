now<00:04:28.090> that's<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.660> there<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.050> problem<00:04:30.380> you

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
now that's that there is a problem you

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.800 
now that's that there is a problem you
can<00:04:31.160> build<00:04:31.550> heat<00:04:31.820> transfer<00:04:32.270> unit<00:04:32.570> for<00:04:32.720> you

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
can build heat transfer unit for you

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.890 
can build heat transfer unit for you
would<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.770> good<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.120> mean<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.480> sounds
