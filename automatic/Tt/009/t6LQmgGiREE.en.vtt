00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.140
 they call themselves the guardians of the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.880
 galaxy 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.880
 what band of degenerates 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.990
 like 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 why would you accept the exhilaration of life 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.690
 because I think it's a thing 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690
 given to us 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.800
 if we do not defend the galaxy 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.800
 who will do it we follow him 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.670
 It will hurt 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.500
 we will not sit there idly 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.119
 while the forces of evil is getting ready 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.119
 to exterminate billions of innocence 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 yeah 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.369
 g 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.450
 momo 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.390
 you are our last chance 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.670
 the brilliant idea segan we had great 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.800
 well 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.230
 it was really really a UFO 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.430
 cinematographic I was going to say that's good 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.040
 is going to be an entertainment like all 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.330
 others and in fact it's pretty amazing 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.970
 the story the special effects them 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.380
 actors the character 20 everything is great 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.850
 well tell it's huge it's 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 really very well the characters are 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.320
 very very nice and we laughed a lot 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.910
 humor that's a good point of the movie 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.070
 I think the soundtrack is everything 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.470
 frankly it's super super super fun 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.420
 it changes others it's much more 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.710
 funny it's a new universe so you have to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.970
 do it but it's really really 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.740
 awesome also at age 40 had not seen a 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.750
 marvel also at the selections the best 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.390
 marvel next yes so far but we 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
 marvel we could see I think a mayor 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.540
 movies for me it's the best 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.090
 marker of all time the movie of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 the year and a rocket and a group 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.050
 excellent here is the fun of the elder 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.350
 must see really 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.350
 really 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.730
 what is that a band was like that 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.290
 normal they drag on the floor 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.630
 jal and wants to put in a box a 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.710
 can that change what with you all 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.710
 way there's no way to laugh
