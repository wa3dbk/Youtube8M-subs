00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
now instead of doing this that'll

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.250

this<00:03:25.080> big<00:03:25.410> fat<00:03:25.950> edge<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.330> pound<00:03:27.570> on<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
this big fat edge and just pound on the

this big fat edge and just pound on the
top<00:03:28.350> tip
