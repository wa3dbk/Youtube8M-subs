00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.039
 to cook this 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.470
 cool two-color ice cream us 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.869
 will need frozen bananas from me 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.519
 here four and a half somewhere 5 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.319
 bananas 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.329
 this is by the way a great option for 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.640
 to store bananas 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.499
 if you are not going to eat them in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.870
 soon and see that they are all 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.750
 darken just peel off and put 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.460
 in the freezer they will be useful to you 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.400
 we also need an ordinary blender 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.680
 I have not very powerful about 600 watts and 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.800
 I therefore add a little water here 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.760
 he will have to work hard i will help him 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 adding some water 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.230
 this process will take some time 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.540
 get ready because they are so simple 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.060
 will grind these bananas into such 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.520
 ice cream similar mass you can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.340
 stop along the way and take pictures 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 banana residue with a silicone spatula 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 add some more water but not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 add a lot to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.320
 ice cream did not work watery to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 Now that was the air structure 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.330
 we did look just like this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 cool air measure looks sweet 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 there is no honey no sugar no 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.590
 flavors nothing 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.990
 very cool, be patient a couple 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.120
 minutes it took he could not be a minute 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.810
 three or four to grind it 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.730
 ice cream 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.980
 but no matter how hard he is 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.190
 do anything so everything will do for you 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.410
 mr blender what i want to do now 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.020
 I'll put my plate aside 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.530
 portion and in the remaining half I 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.900
 add a tablespoon of carob or you can 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.550
 add a tablespoon of cocoa difference 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.550
 here, in fact, no tupit 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.820
 whip 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.820
 the remaining ice cream literally 30 seconds 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.600
 in order to cocoa powder or box 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.980
 evenly distributed what happened 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.170
 see what beauty is the structure of this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.209
 ice cream is just airy if you 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.970

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.480
