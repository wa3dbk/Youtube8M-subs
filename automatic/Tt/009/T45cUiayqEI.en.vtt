there is accelerometers which is very
we're<00:01:22.080> trying<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> type<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> motion

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
we're trying to do this type of motion

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
we're trying to do this type of motion
and<00:01:23.520> movement<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.509> measures<00:01:24.869> gravity<00:01:25.320> XYZ

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and movement it's measures gravity XYZ

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
and movement it's measures gravity XYZ
there's<00:01:26.520> also<00:01:26.820> an<00:01:27.150> infrared<00:01:27.509> camera<00:01:27.619> at

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there's also an infrared camera at

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
there's also an infrared camera at
luckys<00:01:28.979> allows<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> track<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.119> infrared

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
luckys allows you to track for infrared

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
luckys allows you to track for infrared
objects<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> return<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.159> x<00:01:32.310> y&amp;z

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
objects and you can return the x y&amp;z

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
objects and you can return the x y&amp;z
with<00:01:32.939> x<00:01:33.119> y<00:01:33.270> dice<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.259> outputs<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.920> basically

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with x y dice the outputs are basically

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.200 
with x y dice the outputs are basically
four<00:01:35.340> leds<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:37.799> run<00:01:38.070> both<00:01:38.280> logic<00:01:38.850> shakes

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
four leds and a run both logic shakes

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.950 
four leds and a run both logic shakes
and<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:40.079> steeper<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> what<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and a steeper so what are some of the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
and a steeper so what are some of the
different<00:01:43.320> things<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> people<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.250> done

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
different things that people have done

with this I'm going to be going over

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.960 
with this I'm going to be going over
some<00:01:46.380> demos<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.430> quick<00:01:47.610> down

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
some demos are very quick down

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.860 
some demos are very quick down
working<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.540> darkness

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.059 
in this in this case what they have is
they<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> wii<00:02:07.479> remote<00:02:07.869> pointing<00:02:08.679> towards

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
they have a wii remote pointing towards

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.949 
they have a wii remote pointing towards
you<00:02:09.190> they<00:02:09.580> have<00:02:09.759> infrared<00:02:10.179> light<00:02:10.450> source<00:02:10.750> and

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
you they have infrared light source and

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.690 
you they have infrared light source and
are<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> fingertips<00:02:11.830> they<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.190> reflectors

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
are the fingertips they have reflectors

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.420 
are the fingertips they have reflectors
so<00:02:13.209> by<00:02:13.420> doing<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:14.650> create

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so by doing that you can actually create

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.000 
so by doing that you can actually create
multiple<00:02:15.849> points<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.450> you're<00:02:16.540> interacting

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
multiple points that you're interacting

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.110 
multiple points that you're interacting
there's<00:02:18.010> also<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.310> number<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.700> things<00:02:18.790> people

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
there's also a number of things people

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.390 
there's also a number of things people
have<00:02:19.150> done<00:02:19.239> with<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:20.099> witness<00:02:21.099> as<00:02:21.280> an

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
have done with the witness as an

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.220 
have done with the witness as an
employee<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.420> use<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.750> wii<00:02:22.870> remote

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
employee so you can use the wii remote

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
employee so you can use the wii remote
as<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> multi-touch<00:02:24.099> input<00:02:24.370> device<00:02:24.819> you<00:02:25.239> can

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
as a multi-touch input device you can

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.750 
as a multi-touch input device you can
also<00:02:25.630> use<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.319> whiteboard<00:02:27.160> substitute

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
also use it as a whiteboard substitute

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.250 
also use it as a whiteboard substitute
you<00:02:27.880> can<00:02:28.030> both<00:02:28.180> go<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> whiteboard<00:02:28.780> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
you can both go to whiteboard and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.650 
you can both go to whiteboard and
actually<00:02:29.739> draw<00:02:30.010> with<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> infrared<00:02:31.000> pack<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
actually draw with a infrared pack and

laptop you can measure how quickly are
you<00:04:08.040> starting<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.519> do<00:04:08.640> something<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.420> can

you starting to do something you can

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.390 
you starting to do something you can
check<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.959> seat<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.680> know<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.160> is<00:04:11.220> my

really well when i'm going to be

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.240 
really well when i'm going to be
demonstrating<00:04:18.900> his<00:04:19.440> nest<00:04:19.680> case<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.010> i<00:04:20.070> put

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
demonstrating his nest case that i put

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039 
demonstrating his nest case that i put
together<00:04:20.340> which<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.880> basically<00:04:21.239> using<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
together which is basically using the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.460 
together which is basically using the
wii<00:04:22.229> remote<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:23.010> control<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.720> dragonfly<00:04:24.720> so

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
wii remote to control a dragonfly so

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:38.470 
wii remote to control a dragonfly so
lately<00:04:26.340> maybe<00:04:26.669> get<00:04:26.940> set<00:04:27.240> up

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.500 

so<00:04:39.480> this<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.840> this<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.640> this<00:04:41.640> is<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> dragonfly

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
so this is this is this is a dragonfly

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.620 
so this is this is this is a dragonfly
and<00:04:42.920> what<00:04:43.920> if<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.460> can<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.910> normally<00:04:45.300> has<00:04:45.480> the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and what if you can it normally has the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.510 
and what if you can it normally has the
red<00:04:45.780> card<00:04:46.020> two<00:04:46.200> joysticks<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.830> control<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.340> and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
red card two joysticks to control it and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:05:20.010 
red card two joysticks to control it and
let's<00:04:48.390> see

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.200 

imagine<00:05:21.020> this
