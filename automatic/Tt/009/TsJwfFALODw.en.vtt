let's<00:00:07.180> take<00:00:07.330> a<00:00:07.360> look<00:00:07.540> at<00:00:07.779> how<00:00:07.960> we<00:00:08.020> can<00:00:08.260> use<00:00:08.440> a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470 
let's take a look at how we can use a

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.410 
let's take a look at how we can use a
set<00:00:08.770> key<00:00:08.950> in<00:00:09.130> Auto<00:00:09.340> key<00:00:09.549> feature<00:00:09.790> in<00:00:10.000> Maya<00:00:10.180> to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
set key in Auto key feature in Maya to

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.200 
set key in Auto key feature in Maya to
animate<00:00:10.780> the<00:00:10.870> ball<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:12.370> time<00:00:12.549> slider<00:00:12.820> is<00:00:13.030> at

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
animate the ball the time slider is at

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.480 
animate the ball the time slider is at
60<00:00:13.599> frames<00:00:13.780> over<00:00:14.110> here<00:00:14.290> I<00:00:14.470> can<00:00:15.160> go<00:00:15.309> to<00:00:15.340> the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
60 frames over here I can go to the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.060 
60 frames over here I can go to the
animation<00:00:15.940> preferences<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.710> can<00:00:17.890> see

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
animation preferences and you can see

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.769 
animation preferences and you can see
that<00:00:18.250> my<00:00:18.460> key<00:00:18.670> text<00:00:18.970> size<00:00:19.180> which<00:00:19.450> is<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.660> key

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
that my key text size which is the key

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.920 
that my key text size which is the key
frame<00:00:19.990> size<00:00:20.200> is<00:00:20.349> set<00:00:20.500> at<00:00:20.619> 15<00:00:21.810> also<00:00:22.810> the

playback speed is at real time 30 frames
per<00:00:25.000> second<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.510> I've<00:00:25.960> also<00:00:26.109> gone<00:00:26.289> to

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
per second and I've also gone to

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.050 
per second and I've also gone to
settings<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.070> changed<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.580> time<00:00:27.789> over<00:00:27.910> here

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
settings and changed the time over here

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.109 
settings and changed the time over here
to<00:00:28.240> 30<00:00:28.420> frames<00:00:28.539> a<00:00:28.779> second<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:30.310> is<00:00:30.340> basically

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
to 30 frames a second which is basically

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.580 
to 30 frames a second which is basically
my<00:00:31.330> total<00:00:31.599> animation<00:00:32.019> is<00:00:32.110> gonna<00:00:32.199> be<00:00:32.379> two

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
my total animation is gonna be two

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.650 
my total animation is gonna be two
seconds<00:00:33.040> so<00:00:33.970> right<00:00:34.210> now<00:00:34.330> with<00:00:34.449> the<00:00:34.510> ball

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
seconds so right now with the ball

here's the hotkey right here s the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.900 
here's the hotkey right here s the
moment<00:00:44.710> I<00:00:44.739> had<00:00:44.890> s<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:45.219> can<00:00:45.370> see<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.610> channel

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
moment I had s you can see the channel

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.119 
moment I had s you can see the channel
box<00:00:46.120> indicates<00:00:46.780> that<00:00:47.020> all<00:00:47.530> these<00:00:47.950> attributes

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
box indicates that all these attributes

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.350 
box indicates that all these attributes
have<00:00:48.579> been<00:00:48.610> keyframe

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
have been keyframe

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.470 
have been keyframe
I<00:00:49.390> can<00:00:49.989> advance<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.379> frame<00:00:50.710> 30<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.489> move<00:00:52.329> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
I can advance to frame 30 and move the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.260 
I can advance to frame 30 and move the
ball<00:00:52.660> over<00:00:52.989> here<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.500> also<00:00:54.250> up<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.730> hit<00:00:55.059> s

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
ball over here and also up and hit s

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.450 
ball over here and also up and hit s
again<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.840> there<00:00:56.739> you<00:00:56.800> go<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.190> ball<00:00:57.370> is

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
again and there you go the ball is

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.880 
again and there you go the ball is
traveling<00:00:57.879> from<00:00:58.149> frame<00:00:58.449> 1<00:00:58.480> through<00:00:58.840> 30<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.260> can

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
traveling from frame 1 through 30 I can

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.130 
traveling from frame 1 through 30 I can
go<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.129> frame<00:01:00.340> 60<00:01:00.789> right<00:01:01.000> now<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.449> move<00:01:02.050> the

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
go to frame 60 right now and move the

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.650 
go to frame 60 right now and move the
ball<00:01:02.320> forward<00:01:02.770> and<00:01:03.070> then<00:01:03.640> also<00:01:03.789> kind<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.509> move

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
ball forward and then also kind of move

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.580 
ball forward and then also kind of move
it<00:01:04.780> down<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.670> hit<00:01:06.880> s<00:01:07.030> one<00:01:07.360> more<00:01:07.570> time<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:08.410> right

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
it down and hit s one more time so right

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800 
it down and hit s one more time so right
now<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.130> play<00:01:09.399> this<00:01:09.700> animation<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.600> is

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
now if I play this animation this is

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.969 
now if I play this animation this is
what<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.560> ball<00:01:11.740> looks<00:01:12.010> like<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:14.680> I'm<00:01:14.799> gonna

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
what the ball looks like now I'm gonna

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.160 
what the ball looks like now I'm gonna
turn<00:01:15.189> on<00:01:15.400> AutoKey<00:01:15.970> over<00:01:16.299> here<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.720> AutoKey

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
turn on AutoKey over here and AutoKey

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.960 
turn on AutoKey over here and AutoKey
requires<00:01:17.530> at<00:01:17.680> least<00:01:17.740> one<00:01:17.950> keyframe<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.640> be<00:01:18.729> set

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
requires at least one keyframe to be set

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.210 
requires at least one keyframe to be set
before<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.600> start<00:01:19.869> making<00:01:20.590> any<00:01:20.680> changes<00:01:21.100> to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
before you start making any changes to

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.999 
before you start making any changes to
your<00:01:21.250> model<00:01:22.090> so<00:01:22.540> right<00:01:22.780> now<00:01:22.930> I'm<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:23.799> frame<00:01:23.979> 30

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
your model so right now I'm at frame 30

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.920 
your model so right now I'm at frame 30
but<00:01:24.490> there's<00:01:24.670> already<00:01:24.880> some<00:01:25.210> keyframes<00:01:25.659> at

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
but there's already some keyframes at

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.890 
but there's already some keyframes at
frame<00:01:26.439> one<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.729> translate<00:01:28.210> rotate<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.810> all

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
frame one for translate rotate and all

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.140 
frame one for translate rotate and all
these<00:01:29.020> guys<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.400> ball<00:01:30.549> selected<00:01:31.030> I'm

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
these guys so with the ball selected I'm

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.450 
these guys so with the ball selected I'm
simply<00:01:31.540> gonna<00:01:31.659> go<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.140> start<00:01:32.710> rotating<00:01:32.979> this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
simply gonna go and start rotating this

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.960 
simply gonna go and start rotating this
so<00:01:34.119> let's<00:01:34.450> start<00:01:34.630> rotating<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.290> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so let's start rotating this and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.100 
so let's start rotating this and
actually<00:01:36.970> I'm<00:01:37.090> gonna<00:01:37.180> go<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.720> positive

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
actually I'm gonna go in a positive

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.609 
actually I'm gonna go in a positive
direction<00:01:38.350> so<00:01:38.560> let's<00:01:38.860> try<00:01:39.070> it<00:01:39.130> 300<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.619> let's

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
direction so let's try it 300 and let's

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.640 
direction so let's try it 300 and let's
see<00:01:41.799> what<00:01:42.369> happened<00:01:43.229> let's<00:01:44.229> go<00:01:44.409> right<00:01:44.619> here

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
see what happened let's go right here

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.469 
see what happened let's go right here
and<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.189> see<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.579> ball<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.820> nicely

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
and you can see that the ball is nicely

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.249 
and you can see that the ball is nicely
rotating<00:01:47.409> from<00:01:47.680> point<00:01:47.979> A<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.430> B<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.329> let's<00:01:50.110> go

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
rotating from point A to B and let's go

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.679 
rotating from point A to B and let's go
to<00:01:50.320> frame<00:01:50.799> 60<00:01:51.220> because<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:52.090> keyframe<00:01:52.509> was

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
to frame 60 because the keyframe was

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.620 
to frame 60 because the keyframe was
already<00:01:52.990> set<00:01:53.229> at<00:01:53.409> frame<00:01:53.860> 1<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.369> went<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.119> 30<00:01:55.360> and

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
already set at frame 1 I went to 30 and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.899 
already set at frame 1 I went to 30 and
simply<00:01:56.049> input<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.350> value<00:01:56.409> over<00:01:56.920> here<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.729> ball

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
simply input a value over here the ball

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.770 
simply input a value over here the ball
pretty<00:01:58.329> much<00:01:58.509> rotated<00:01:59.079> from<00:01:59.259> 0<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:01.270> 30<00:02:01.540> and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
pretty much rotated from 0 to 30 and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.160 
pretty much rotated from 0 to 30 and
from<00:02:02.680> 30<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.979> 60<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.700> want<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:04.750> around

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
from 30 to 60 I want it to go around

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.699 
from 30 to 60 I want it to go around
let's<00:02:05.829> say<00:02:06.009> 850<00:02:06.990> you'll<00:02:07.990> see<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.350> right<00:02:08.679> now

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
let's say 850 you'll see that right now

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.130 
let's say 850 you'll see that right now
it<00:02:09.640> comes<00:02:09.910> here<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.299> then<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.630> keeps<00:02:10.899> rotating

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
it comes here and then it keeps rotating

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.390 
it comes here and then it keeps rotating
and<00:02:11.739> lands<00:02:12.130> over<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> auto<00:02:15.160> key

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
and lands over here so the auto key

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.550 
and lands over here so the auto key
needs<00:02:16.000> at<00:02:16.209> least<00:02:16.390> one<00:02:16.660> keyframe<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.260> be<00:02:17.349> set

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
needs at least one keyframe to be set

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.450 
needs at least one keyframe to be set
before

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
before

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.520 
before
