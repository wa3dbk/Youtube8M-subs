this one of my favorite tricks I've done
it<00:00:44.950> on<00:00:45.129> some<00:00:45.940> other<00:00:46.090> vehicles<00:00:46.660> like<00:00:46.809> the<00:00:46.930> GMC

over<00:00:47.770> there<00:00:48.120> things<00:00:49.120> like<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.989> had<00:00:50.140> to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
over there things like that and I had to

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.220 
over there things like that and I had to
put<00:00:50.379> speakers<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:52.090> I<00:00:52.120> do<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.719> I<00:00:52.840> cover<00:00:53.079> the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
put speakers in what I do is I cover the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.900 
put speakers in what I do is I cover the
speaker<00:00:53.590> with<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.770> light<00:00:54.010> layer<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.219> paper<00:00:54.579> towel

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
speaker with a light layer a paper towel

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.600 
speaker with a light layer a paper towel
as<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.840> crude<00:00:56.199> sort<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.590> grill<00:00:56.739> cloth<00:00:57.039> it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
as a crude sort of grill cloth it's

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.790 
as a crude sort of grill cloth it's
white<00:00:57.879> so<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.239> reflects<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.719> heat<00:00:58.960> keeps<00:00:59.620> from

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
white so it reflects the heat keeps from

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.189 
white so it reflects the heat keeps from
roasting<00:01:00.250> your<00:01:00.399> speakers<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.510> if<00:01:01.719> it<00:01:01.809> changes

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
roasting your speakers and if it changes

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.569 
roasting your speakers and if it changes
the<00:01:02.320> sound<00:01:02.559> at<00:01:02.710> all<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:03.010> can<00:01:03.160> easily<00:01:03.489> adjust

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
the sound at all you can easily adjust

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.600 
the sound at all you can easily adjust
it<00:01:03.940> with<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.119> tone<00:01:04.330> control<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:06.100> why<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
it with the tone control but why is the

colors<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.450> wire<00:04:01.600> somewhere<00:04:02.020> so<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:02.950> can<00:04:03.070> keep

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
colors of wire somewhere so I can keep

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.800 
colors of wire somewhere so I can keep
the<00:04:03.370> left<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.820> right<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.180> positive<00:04:04.450> and
