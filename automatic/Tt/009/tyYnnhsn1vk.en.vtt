looking at 2,000 points per perk and the
only<00:02:04.500> weapons<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.219> could<00:02:05.430> find<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.030> far

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
only weapons that I could find so far

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.999 
only weapons that I could find so far
were<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.719> launchers<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
were the launchers and they are a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.839 
were the launchers and they are a
thousand<00:02:08.789> points<00:02:09.679> per<00:02:10.679> launcher<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.760> they

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
thousand points per launcher and they

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.089 
thousand points per launcher and they
were<00:02:11.970> listed<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> secondary<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> kind<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
were listed as a secondary so I kind of

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.040 
were listed as a secondary so I kind of
have<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> feeling<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.000> secondaries<00:02:15.870> will

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
have a feeling all the secondaries will

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.740 
have a feeling all the secondaries will
probably<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> thousand<00:02:17.370> points<00:02:17.550> each<00:02:17.849> but

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
probably be a thousand points each but

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.620 
probably be a thousand points each but
if<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> guys<00:02:19.860> hear<00:02:20.340> anything<00:02:20.459> else<00:02:20.819> let<00:02:21.599> me

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
