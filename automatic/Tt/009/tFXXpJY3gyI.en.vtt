here's<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:07.460> weird<00:02:07.640> noises<00:02:07.990> such<00:02:08.990> as<00:02:10.900> we're

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
here's some weird noises such as we're

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:39.370 
here's some weird noises such as we're
going<00:02:14.080> now<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:38.480> course<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.840> still<00:02:39.020> find<00:02:39.290> me

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
going now and of course it still find me

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.160 
going now and of course it still find me
but<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.600> idea<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.520> think<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.610> might

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
but get the idea I think I might

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.430 
but get the idea I think I might
disconnect<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.530> tape<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.670> off<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.840> tape<00:02:48.080> so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
disconnect the tape at off the tape so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.660 
disconnect the tape at off the tape so
it<00:02:48.580> stops<00:02:49.580> playing<00:02:49.850> jazz<00:02:50.180> music<00:02:50.209> obviously

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it stops playing jazz music obviously

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.309 
it stops playing jazz music obviously
and<00:02:56.200> yeah<00:02:57.200> make<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.950> more<00:02:58.069> permanent<00:02:59.230> in<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
and yeah make it more permanent in the

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.340 
and yeah make it more permanent in the
meantime

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.100 

it<00:03:08.350> sounds<00:03:08.620> bad<00:03:08.890> either
