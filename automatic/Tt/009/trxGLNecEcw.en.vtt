00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
that's nailed that was great by the way

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
that's nailed that was great by the way
this<00:04:57.070> piece<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.700> suzuki<00:04:58.150> book<00:04:58.330> too<00:04:58.599> so<00:04:58.960> if

this piece is in suzuki book too so if
you<00:04:59.110> guys<00:04:59.200> ever<00:04:59.349> want<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.650> work<00:04:59.740> on<00:04:59.889> this

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
you guys ever want to work on this

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.830 
you guys ever want to work on this
that's<00:05:00.970> where<00:05:01.180> it's<00:05:01.300> at<00:05:01.389> it's<00:05:01.570> called<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
that's where it's at it's called the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.860 
that's where it's at it's called the
minuet<00:05:03.090> we've<00:05:04.090> worked<00:05:04.300> really<00:05:04.360> hard<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
minuet we've worked really hard in the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.440 
minuet we've worked really hard in the
rhythm<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.260> sounds<00:05:05.590> great<00:05:06.270> some<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
rhythm that sounds great some of the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.550 
rhythm that sounds great some of the
cicadas<00:05:07.810> could<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.169> been<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.289> little<00:05:08.380> bit

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
cicadas could have been a little bit

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
cicadas could have been a little bit
shorter<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.970> like

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.249 

alright<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.849> then<00:05:21.419> also<00:05:21.539> pay<00:05:21.810> attention<00:05:21.840> a

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
alright and then also pay attention a

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.689 
alright and then also pay attention a
little<00:05:22.349> bit<00:05:22.530> closer<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.949> dynamics<00:05:23.490> right

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
little bit closer the dynamics right

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.869 
little bit closer the dynamics right
when<00:05:24.599> you<00:05:24.690> start<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.020> pickup<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:26.280> measure<00:05:26.460> 5

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
when you start the pickup to measure 5

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.730 
when you start the pickup to measure 5
so<00:05:27.539> you<00:05:27.629> can<00:05:27.780> do<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.080> cow<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.530> little

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
so you can do this to cow just a little

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.969 
so you can do this to cow just a little
bit<00:05:28.830> shorter<00:05:30.409> it's<00:05:31.409> going<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.590> be<00:05:31.650> up<00:05:31.770> both

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
bit shorter it's going to be up both

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:38.080 
bit shorter it's going to be up both
pick<00:05:32.340> up<00:05:32.900> double<00:05:33.900> down<00:05:34.020> your<00:05:34.199> side<00:05:34.349> Oh

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
like any other piece is going to be four

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.180 
like any other piece is going to be four
steps<00:06:02.449> and<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:03.320> like<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.650> said<00:06:03.800> goes<00:06:03.919> for<00:06:04.070> any

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.290 
steps and this like I said goes for any
other<00:06:04.310> piece<00:06:04.490> you<00:06:04.759> got<00:06:04.850> to<00:06:04.970> learn<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.180> notes

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
other piece you got to learn the notes

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.529 
other piece you got to learn the notes
first<00:06:05.690> right<00:06:06.050> Marco<00:06:07.210> second<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.270> gotta<00:06:08.419> learn

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
first right Marco second you gotta learn

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.150 
first right Marco second you gotta learn
the<00:06:08.720> rhythm<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.440> we<00:06:09.530> got<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.680> make<00:06:09.770> sure<00:06:09.830> that

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
the rhythm so we got to make sure that

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.590 
the rhythm so we got to make sure that
we're<00:06:10.280> doing<00:06:10.310> everything<00:06:10.610> this<00:06:11.180> is<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.449> right

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
we're doing everything this is the right

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.779 
we're doing everything this is the right
you<00:06:11.960> know<00:06:12.050> back<00:06:12.350> and<00:06:12.500> forth<00:06:12.590> either<00:06:13.130> half<00:06:13.550> no

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
you know back and forth either half no

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.460 
you know back and forth either half no
quarter<00:06:14.180> notes<00:06:14.330> so<00:06:14.539> on<00:06:14.630> that's<00:06:14.900> important<00:06:15.380> to

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
quarter notes so on that's important to

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.740 
quarter notes so on that's important to
focus<00:06:15.590> on<00:06:15.919> then<00:06:16.789> what's<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.509> third<00:06:17.690> thing

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
focus on then what's the third thing

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.060 
focus on then what's the third thing
mark<00:06:18.169> old<00:06:18.320> you<00:06:18.410> know<00:06:20.710> hold<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:21.770> rhythm<00:06:22.009> and

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
mark old you know hold the rhythm and

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.650 
mark old you know hold the rhythm and
then<00:06:22.250> we<00:06:22.310> have<00:06:22.430> the<00:06:22.490> slurs<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.030> articulation

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
then we have the slurs the articulation

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.210 
then we have the slurs the articulation
the<00:06:23.840> staccato<00:06:24.139> right<00:06:24.590> that's<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.130> third

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
the staccato right that's the third

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.310 
the staccato right that's the third
thing<00:06:25.610> and<00:06:25.850> then<00:06:26.479> once<00:06:26.690> you're<00:06:26.840> ready<00:06:27.169> to

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
thing and then once you're ready to
