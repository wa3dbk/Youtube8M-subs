00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
theme in my consultation and when I when

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.480 
theme in my consultation and when I when
I<00:00:23.840> see<00:00:24.110> like<00:00:24.439> kind<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.740> same<00:00:24.950> questions

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
I see like kind of the same questions

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.790 
I see like kind of the same questions
are<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.730> same<00:00:25.790> answers<00:00:26.360> come<00:00:26.600> up<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.990> decided

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
are the same answers come up I decided

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.990 
are the same answers come up I decided
to<00:00:27.890> put<00:00:28.040> together<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.369> video<00:00:28.640> for<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:28.910> because

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
to put together a video for it because

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.659 
to put together a video for it because
it's<00:00:29.270> indicative<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.040> more<00:00:31.040> than<00:00:31.279> just<00:00:31.490> you

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
it's indicative that more than just you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.700 
it's indicative that more than just you
two<00:00:31.910> guys<00:00:32.150> or<00:00:32.210> three<00:00:32.660> guys<00:00:32.840> a<00:00:32.900> three<00:00:33.290> gal<00:00:33.500> to

two guys or three guys a three gal to
have<00:00:33.800> this<00:00:33.950> question<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:34.550> it<00:00:34.880> would<00:00:35.030> be<00:00:35.060> a

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
have this question and it would be a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.240 
have this question and it would be a
beneficial<00:00:35.630> lesson<00:00:36.050> to<00:00:36.200> everybody<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.130> this

hurdle or but it can apply to anyone and
it's<00:00:46.340> why<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:46.670> attack<00:00:47.180> Hills<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:47.840> said<00:00:47.989> well

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
it's why you attack Hills you said well

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.380 
it's why you attack Hills you said well
what<00:00:48.199> does<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.469> mean<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.769> tack<00:00:48.980> Hills<00:00:49.390> it's

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
what does that mean the tack Hills it's

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.189 
what does that mean the tack Hills it's
a<00:00:50.629> it's<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.989> word<00:00:51.199> from<00:00:51.410> cycling<00:00:51.949> or<00:00:52.160> running<00:00:52.879> I

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
a it's a word from cycling or running I

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.009 
a it's a word from cycling or running I
was<00:00:54.199> an<00:00:54.289> avid<00:00:54.469> cyclist<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.600> what<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.750> learn

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
was an avid cyclist and what you learn

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.720 
was an avid cyclist and what you learn
quickly<00:00:57.469> is<00:00:57.679> let's<00:00:57.949> say<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.100> got<00:00:58.219> a<00:00:58.250> big<00:00:58.489> hill

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
quickly is let's say you got a big hill

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.660 
quickly is let's say you got a big hill
to<00:00:58.760> go<00:00:58.969> up<00:00:59.410> you<00:01:00.410> do<00:01:00.620> not<00:01:02.050> go<00:01:03.050> up<00:01:03.199> there

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
to go up you do not go up there

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.850 
to go up you do not go up there
lackadaisically<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.879> then<00:01:05.870> just<00:01:06.170> get<00:01:06.740> up

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
lackadaisically and then just get up

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.220 
lackadaisically and then just get up
there<00:01:06.890> at<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.190> slow<00:01:07.430> pace<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.910> endure<00:01:08.480> it<00:01:08.600> in

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
there at a slow pace and endure it in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.690 
there at a slow pace and endure it in
other<00:01:09.410> words<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.800> don't<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.220> don't<00:01:10.370> slow

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
other words you don't you don't slow

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.950 
other words you don't you don't slow
down<00:01:10.970> thinking<00:01:11.480> you're<00:01:11.570> going<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.780> save

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
down thinking you're going to save

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.410 
down thinking you're going to save
energy<00:01:12.230> what<00:01:12.980> you<00:01:13.100> do<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.370> you<00:01:13.520> attack<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.000> I

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
energy what you do is you attack it I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.540 
energy what you do is you attack it I
mean<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.380> go<00:01:15.530> up<00:01:15.710> at<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.040> get<00:01:16.190> muscle

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
mean you go up at you get muscle

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.090 
mean you go up at you get muscle
momentum<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.780> go<00:01:17.990> up<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.440> if<00:01:18.860> you're

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
momentum and you go up it and if you're

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.100 
momentum and you go up it and if you're
going<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.340> put<00:01:19.520> energy<00:01:19.730> into<00:01:20.090> anything<00:01:20.450> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
going to put energy into anything you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.570 
going to put energy into anything you
put<00:01:21.290> your<00:01:21.350> energy<00:01:21.800> into<00:01:21.830> getting<00:01:22.100> up<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:22.520> over

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
put your energy into getting up and over

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.730 
put your energy into getting up and over
that<00:01:22.790> hill<00:01:23.000> as<00:01:23.090> quickly<00:01:23.330> as<00:01:23.540> possible<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that hill as quickly as possible and the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.110 
that hill as quickly as possible and the
reason<00:01:24.920> why<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.520> even<00:01:25.790> though<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.000> may

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
reason why is that even though it may

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.270 
reason why is that even though it may
not<00:01:26.150> seem<00:01:26.410> correct<00:01:27.410> or<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:27.980> might<00:01:28.100> seem

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
not seem correct or it might seem

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.700 
not seem correct or it might seem
counterintuitive<00:01:28.870> he's<00:01:29.870> like<00:01:30.110> we're<00:01:30.590> going

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
counterintuitive he's like we're going

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.810 
counterintuitive he's like we're going
up<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.980> hill<00:01:31.130> shouldn't<00:01:31.430> want<00:01:31.550> to<00:01:31.640> pace

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
up the hill shouldn't want to pace

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.310 
up the hill shouldn't want to pace
yourself<00:01:31.850> up<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.630> hill<00:01:32.780> save<00:01:33.020> some<00:01:33.230> energy

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
yourself up that hill save some energy

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.490 
yourself up that hill save some energy
you<00:01:33.920> actually<00:01:34.220> expend<00:01:34.910> more<00:01:35.120> energy<00:01:35.500> slowly

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you actually expend more energy slowly

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.220 
you actually expend more energy slowly
going<00:01:36.920> up<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.370> hill<00:01:37.720> many<00:01:38.720> if<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.050> do

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
going up the hill many if you do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.470 
going up the hill many if you do
attacking<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.790> kind<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.120> saying<00:01:41.300> that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
attacking it it's kind of saying that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.540 
attacking it it's kind of saying that
it's<00:01:41.930> because<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.710> time<00:01:42.950> you're<00:01:43.430> spending

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
it's because of the time you're spending

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's because of the time you're spending
less<00:01:44.030> time<00:01:44.080> suffering<00:01:45.080> going<00:01:45.380> up<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.680> hill

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
less time suffering going up that hill

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.860 
less time suffering going up that hill
yeah<00:01:46.430> you're<00:01:46.670> burning<00:01:47.030> out<00:01:47.180> really<00:01:47.600> quickly

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
yeah you're burning out really quickly

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.080 
yeah you're burning out really quickly
but<00:01:48.740> you're<00:01:48.920> since<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.280> are<00:01:49.370> attacking<00:01:49.730> at

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
but you're since you are attacking at

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.940

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
you must attack them ferociously not

you must attack them ferociously not
only<00:02:53.420> because<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.989> it's<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.409> ferocious<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.950> the

only because I it's the ferocious is the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.710 
only because I it's the ferocious is the
right<00:02:55.250> thing<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.519> do<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.909> in<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.390> long<00:02:56.689> run

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
right thing to do but in the long run

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.199 
right thing to do but in the long run
overall<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.650> actually<00:02:58.069> is<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.310> easier<00:02:59.000> way<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
overall it actually is the easier way to

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.520 
overall it actually is the easier way to
do<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.540> it's<00:02:59.659> also<00:02:59.810> very<00:03:00.049> similar<00:03:00.409> to<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
do it it's also very similar to the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.080 
do it it's also very similar to the
advice<00:03:00.889> I'd<00:03:01.069> give<00:03:01.099> about<00:03:01.400> engine<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.940> is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
advice I'd give about engine and it is

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.649 
advice I'd give about engine and it is
harder<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> human<00:03:04.609> arts<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.120> human<00:03:05.450> knob
