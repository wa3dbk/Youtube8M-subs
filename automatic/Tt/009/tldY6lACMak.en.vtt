fingers the grip of the stick will come

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.610 
fingers the grip of the stick will come
from<00:00:08.400> these<00:00:08.610> two<00:00:08.849> fingers<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:10.170> control

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
from these two fingers and the control

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.950 
from these two fingers and the control
of<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.800> stick<00:00:11.070> will<00:00:11.519> come<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:12.000> these<00:00:12.599> three

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
of the stick will come from these three

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.140 
of the stick will come from these three
fingers<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.400> these<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> ones<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
fingers and these are the ones that I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.109 
fingers and these are the ones that I
really<00:00:15.210> want<00:00:15.660> us<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.650> focus<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.730> order<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
really want us to focus on in order to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.840 
really want us to focus on in order to
take<00:00:18.900> our<00:00:19.109> double<00:00:19.439> strokes<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
take our double strokes to the the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.509 
take our double strokes to the the
faster<00:00:21.390> levels<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> start<00:00:24.090> off<00:00:24.300> by<00:00:24.470> playing

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
faster levels so start off by playing

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.250 
faster levels so start off by playing
single<00:00:26.519> strokes<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.140> really<00:00:28.140> concentrate<00:00:28.920> on

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
single strokes and really concentrate on

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.500 
single strokes and really concentrate on
moving<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> stick<00:00:32.030> controlling<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> stick

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
moving the stick controlling the stick

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:46.130 
moving the stick controlling the stick
with<00:00:34.290> those<00:00:34.559> three<00:00:34.950> fingers<00:00:43.550> at<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:45.140> your

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
with those three fingers at first your

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920 
with those three fingers at first your
if<00:00:46.950> you've<00:00:47.129> never<00:00:47.309> done<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.670> before<00:00:47.930> that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
if you've never done this before that

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.529 
if you've never done this before that
these<00:00:49.860> two<00:00:50.160> fingers<00:00:50.430> will<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.090> move<00:00:51.300> up

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
these two fingers will really move up

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
these two fingers will really move up
and<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.469> stick<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> you'll<00:00:53.760> find<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and down the stick and you'll find it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270 
and down the stick and you'll find it
really<00:00:54.360> difficult<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> you'll<00:00:55.410> probably<00:00:56.039> be

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
really difficult and you'll probably be

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.560 
really difficult and you'll probably be
playing<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:58.850> uneven<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.180> completely

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
playing it uneven that's completely

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
playing it uneven that's completely
natural<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.949> need<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.359> used

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
natural you just need to just get used

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.179 
natural you just need to just get used
to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> procedure<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.010> implement<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to the procedure and and implement it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.149 
to the procedure and and implement it
and<00:01:08.280> practice<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> regular<00:01:10.110> basis

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.719 

once<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.490> confident<00:01:15.439> over<00:01:16.439> time

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
once you're more confident over time

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.249 
once you're more confident over time
increase<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> speed<00:01:18.470> okay<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.070> help

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
increase the speed okay this will help

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
increase the speed okay this will help
control<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:23.040> movement<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> those<00:01:23.820> three

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
control the movement of those three

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
control the movement of those three
fingers<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> give<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.590> control<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
fingers and give you the control of the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.050 
fingers and give you the control of the
stick<00:01:26.490> rather<00:01:26.850> than<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> other<00:01:27.299> way<00:01:27.360> around

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
stick rather than the other way around

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.450 
stick rather than the other way around
in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.450> time<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:31.470> focus<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.130> keeping<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
in this time really focus on keeping the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.050 
in this time really focus on keeping the
wrist<00:01:35.689> nice<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.020> straight<00:01:37.579> just<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
wrist nice and straight just so all the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:57.969 
wrist nice and straight just so all the
movement<00:01:39.509> comes<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> fingers

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.440 

be<00:01:58.979> quite<00:01:59.250> conscious<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> stick<00:02:00.180> Heights

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
be quite conscious of the stick Heights

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.770 
be quite conscious of the stick Heights
because<00:02:01.080> obviously<00:02:01.350> stick<00:02:01.890> Heights

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
because obviously stick Heights

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
because obviously stick Heights
influence<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.560> control<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.909> you're

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
influence the control of what you're

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.400 
influence the control of what you're
playing<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.500> how<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.250> sounds<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.269> bear<00:02:10.200> those

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
playing and how it sounds so bear those

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.229 
playing and how it sounds so bear those
things<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.860> mind<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:12.110> okay<00:02:13.110> next<00:02:13.590> up<00:02:13.830> is

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
things in mind as well okay next up is

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.270 
things in mind as well okay next up is
after<00:02:15.239> you're<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:15.720> confident<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.290> over

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
after you're really confident that over

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.979 
after you're really confident that over
a<00:02:17.310> certain<00:02:17.730> period<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.150> obviously<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
a certain period of time obviously that

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.449 
a certain period of time obviously that
would<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.110> different<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.650> everybody

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
would be different for everybody

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
would be different for everybody
but<00:02:20.959> start<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.019> introduce<00:02:22.260> into<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.920> double

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
but start to introduce into the double

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.380 
but start to introduce into the double
stroke<00:02:23.430> roll<00:02:24.950> again<00:02:25.950> start<00:02:26.459> off<00:02:26.580> slowly<00:02:26.970> until

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
stroke roll again start off slowly until

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.390 
stroke roll again start off slowly until
you<00:02:27.510> build<00:02:27.660> confidence<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.620> control<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you build confidence and control and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
you build confidence and control and
then<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.269> shift<00:02:30.810> through<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.530> tempos

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
then you can shift through the tempos

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.140 
then you can shift through the tempos
and<00:02:33.500> ultimately<00:02:34.500> take<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.549> wherever<00:02:35.760> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and ultimately take it to wherever you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.880 
and ultimately take it to wherever you
want<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.930> take<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:42.560> exactly<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> same

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
want to take it to exactly the same

want to take it to exactly the same
