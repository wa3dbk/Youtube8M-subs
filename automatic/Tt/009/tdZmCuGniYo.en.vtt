an<00:04:27.479> LGA<00:04:28.069> 775<00:04:29.069> board<00:04:29.599> you<00:04:30.599> can<00:04:30.930> basically<00:04:31.199> if

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
an LGA 775 board you can basically if

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.430 
an LGA 775 board you can basically if
you've<00:04:31.979> got<00:04:32.159> a<00:04:32.190> fancy<00:04:32.490> cooler<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:34.229> don't

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
you've got a fancy cooler and you don't

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.379 
you've got a fancy cooler and you don't
have<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> mounts<00:04:35.069> for<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.340> LGA<00:04:35.699> one<00:04:35.970> one<00:04:36.180> four

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
have the mounts for the LGA one one four

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.200 
have the mounts for the LGA one one four
five<00:04:36.509> five<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.289> use<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:37.770> motherboard

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
five five you can use this motherboard

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.600 
five five you can use this motherboard
with<00:04:39.210> those<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:40.020> white<00:04:40.229> ones<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.770> LGA<00:04:41.159> 1<00:04:41.460> 1

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
with those the white ones of the LGA 1 1

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.510 
with those the white ones of the LGA 1 1
5<00:04:41.819> 5<00:04:42.060> s<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.479> black<00:04:42.750> ones<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:44.280> little

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
5 5 s but the black ones the little

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.089 
5 5 s but the black ones the little
holes<00:04:44.729> next<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:45.419> for<00:04:46.129> the<00:04:47.129> LGA<00:04:47.639> 775<00:04:49.099> so

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
holes next to it for the LGA 775 so

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.920 
holes next to it for the LGA 775 so
that's<00:04:50.610> an<00:04:50.819> interesting<00:04:51.030> thing<00:04:51.300> too<00:04:51.720> so

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
that's an interesting thing too so

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.230 
that's an interesting thing too so
you're<00:04:52.050> gonna<00:04:52.139> save<00:04:52.530> money<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:53.099> you're<00:04:53.340> gonna

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
you're gonna save money if you're gonna

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.180 
you're gonna save money if you're gonna
bring<00:04:54.539> your<00:04:54.599> cooler<00:04:54.930> over<00:04:55.319> from<00:04:55.530> LGA<00:04:55.979> one

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
bring your cooler over from LGA one

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.610 
bring your cooler over from LGA one
seven<00:04:56.819> five<00:04:57.090> which<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:57.930> pretty<00:04:58.169> damn<00:04:58.380> good<00:04:58.560> in

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
seven five which is pretty damn good in

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.379 
seven five which is pretty damn good in
my<00:04:58.830> opinion<00:04:58.949> it's<00:04:59.400> good<00:04:59.580> just<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.120> good<00:05:00.270> little

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
my opinion it's good just a good little

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.490 
my opinion it's good just a good little
extra<00:05:00.840> value<00:05:01.199> added<00:05:02.069> feature<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.990> yeah<00:05:04.259> and

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
extra value added feature so yeah and

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.290 
extra value added feature so yeah and
yeah<00:05:05.039> so<00:05:05.280> basically<00:05:05.490> it's<00:05:05.639> got<00:05:05.759> your<00:05:05.940> onboard

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
yeah so basically it's got your onboard

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.770 
yeah so basically it's got your onboard
video<00:05:07.139> thing<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.030> guess<00:05:09.330> because<00:05:09.509> it's

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
video thing so I guess because it's

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.040 
video thing so I guess because it's
meant<00:05:10.259> for<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.530> i-5<00:05:11.009> and<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.430> i7<00:05:12.000> that<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
meant for the i-5 and the i7 that the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.620 
meant for the i-5 and the i7 that the
ivy<00:05:13.319> bridge<00:05:13.560> it's<00:05:13.770> gonna<00:05:14.190> have<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.630> support

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
ivy bridge it's gonna have that support

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.170 
ivy bridge it's gonna have that support
the<00:05:15.780> onboard<00:05:16.169> graphics<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:17.430> got<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.759> s/pdif

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
the onboard graphics it's got the s/pdif

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.040 
the onboard graphics it's got the s/pdif
FL<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> like<00:05:20.219> that<00:05:20.460> because<00:05:20.669> I<00:05:21.120> play<00:05:21.629> with<00:05:21.840> um

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
FL so I like that because I play with um

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.800 
FL so I like that because I play with um
surround<00:05:22.710> sound<00:05:23.060> it's<00:05:24.060> got<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.240> nice<00:05:24.389> only<00:05:24.690> got

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
surround sound it's got a nice only got

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.270 
surround sound it's got a nice only got
one<00:05:24.960> LAN<00:05:25.169> port<00:05:25.469> but<00:05:25.710> that's<00:05:25.830> not<00:05:26.009> a<00:05:26.039> biggie

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
one LAN port but that's not a biggie

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.740 
one LAN port but that's not a biggie
because<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.699> think<00:05:26.849> that's<00:05:27.060> all<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.270> need

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
because I think that's all I need

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.279 
because I think that's all I need
um<00:05:28.530> it's<00:05:30.020> it's<00:05:31.020> got<00:05:31.169> like<00:05:31.349> I<00:05:31.620> think<00:05:33.289> that's

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
um it's it's got like I think that's

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.930 
um it's it's got like I think that's
like<00:05:34.710> it's<00:05:35.430> got<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> HDMI<00:05:36.180> out<00:05:36.659> port<00:05:36.690> as<00:05:37.169> well

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
like it's got a HDMI out port as well

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.809 
like it's got a HDMI out port as well
it's<00:05:38.940> got<00:05:39.090> one<00:05:39.300> ps2<00:05:39.870> port<00:05:40.370> it's<00:05:41.370> got<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.699> other

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
it's got one ps2 port it's got the other

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.629 
it's got one ps2 port it's got the other
two<00:05:41.940> standard<00:05:42.690> video<00:05:42.810> modes<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:44.009> this<00:05:44.370> looks

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
two standard video modes and this looks

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.899 
two standard video modes and this looks
like<00:05:44.909> I<00:05:46.069> don't<00:05:47.069> know<00:05:47.279> what<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.550> is<00:05:47.729> I<00:05:47.819> think

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
like I don't know what that is I think

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.040 
like I don't know what that is I think
it's<00:05:48.120> just<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.389> USB<00:05:48.750> slots<00:05:49.259> but<00:05:50.419> yeah<00:05:51.419> it's

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
it's just the USB slots but yeah it's

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.820 
it's just the USB slots but yeah it's
got<00:05:52.229> USB<00:05:52.590> slots<00:05:53.099> there<00:05:53.659> but<00:05:54.659> there<00:05:54.870> may<00:05:55.349> be<00:05:55.380> USB

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
got USB slots there but there may be USB

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.980 
got USB slots there but there may be USB
three<00:05:56.099> slots

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
three slots

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.800 
three slots
yeah<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.169> that's<00:05:58.319> um<00:05:58.590> that's<00:05:59.419> about<00:06:00.419> it<00:06:00.659> from

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
yeah and that's um that's about it from

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.920 
yeah and that's um that's about it from
this<00:06:00.990> board<00:06:01.229> so<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:02.009> is<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.940> good<00:06:03.210> board<00:06:03.449> like<00:06:03.779> it

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
this board so it is a good board like it

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.110 
this board so it is a good board like it
the<00:06:04.199> reason<00:06:04.349> I<00:06:04.529> got<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:04.830> board<00:06:05.069> lastly<00:06:06.000> is

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
the reason I got this board lastly is

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.589 
the reason I got this board lastly is
because<00:06:06.449> it's<00:06:06.860> cheap<00:06:08.029> it's<00:06:09.029> got<00:06:09.330> your<00:06:09.479> little

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
because it's cheap it's got your little

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.240 
because it's cheap it's got your little
heat<00:06:09.870> sinks<00:06:10.259> on<00:06:10.409> it<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:10.680> I'll<00:06:10.800> be<00:06:10.889> able<00:06:10.979> to<00:06:11.130> do<00:06:11.219> a

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
heat sinks on it so I'll be able to do a

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.689 
heat sinks on it so I'll be able to do a
little<00:06:11.490> overclock<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:13.770> got<00:06:14.069> yeah<00:06:14.430> it's

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
little overclock and it's got yeah it's

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.120 
little overclock and it's got yeah it's
got<00:06:14.880> your<00:06:15.029> PC<00:06:15.419> i3<00:06:15.870> is<00:06:15.960> it<00:06:16.110> USB<00:06:16.500> three<00:06:16.740> side<00:06:16.979> of
