00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
playing around on the end I actually got

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.060 
playing around on the end I actually got
two<00:00:24.720> trees<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:27.920> I<00:00:28.970> just<00:00:29.970> stumbled<00:00:30.240> across

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
two trees up here I just stumbled across

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.569 
two trees up here I just stumbled across
and<00:00:33.500> made<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> SAP<00:00:34.829> tree<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.430> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and made the SAP tree was you know just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
and made the SAP tree was you know just
no<00:00:36.149> trees<00:00:37.050> only<00:00:37.980> injured<00:00:38.579> trees<00:00:38.879> produce<00:00:39.320> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
no trees only injured trees produce and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.860 
no trees only injured trees produce and
stairway<00:00:41.960> healing<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> like

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
stairway healing it's kind of like

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
stairway healing it's kind of like
actually<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:49.940> here's<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
actually you can use here's the one that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
actually you can use here's the one that
I<00:00:52.340> made<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:54.469> here<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.629> not

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I made right here you see it's not

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.549 
I made right here you see it's not
producing<00:00:58.140> too<00:00:58.410> much<00:00:58.440> that<00:01:00.140> factor<00:01:01.140> leave

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
producing too much that factor leave

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.729 
producing too much that factor leave
this<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.890> alone<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.350> very<00:01:04.589> good

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this one alone it's it's not very good

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.300 
this one alone it's it's not very good

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
how much is the other tree that I just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
how much is the other tree that I just
stumbled<00:01:12.479> across<00:01:13.430> but<00:01:22.009> yeah<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.740 
collect just a little bit I've seen a
few<00:01:25.880> pieces<00:01:26.880> on

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.390

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
we get some of this on here I'm sure

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
we get some of this on here I'm sure
this<00:01:38.490> app<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:39.030> run<00:01:39.299> better<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
this app probably run better in the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.290 
this app probably run better in the
spring<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.619> Prem<00:01:41.460> back<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> check<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
spring so Prem back and check this

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:54.830 
spring so Prem back and check this
spring<00:01:44.420> anyway<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:52.880> always<00:01:53.880> keep<00:01:54.240> extra<00:01:54.420> tins
