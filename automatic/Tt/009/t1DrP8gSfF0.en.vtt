I'm<00:00:44.550> running<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.239> about<00:00:45.329> 21<00:00:45.989> amps<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.539> it's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
I'm running it at about 21 amps and it's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.619 
I'm running it at about 21 amps and it's
installed<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.230> seat<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
installed in the back seat because it's

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
installed in the back seat because it's
warmer<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> winter<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.129> cooler<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
warmer in the winter and cooler in the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.439 
warmer in the winter and cooler in the
summer<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:56.250> also<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:56.850> easier<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> get

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
summer so it's also a lot easier to get

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
summer so it's also a lot easier to get
to<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.870> maintenance<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.420> adjust

lamps when it starts and then the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.140 
lamps when it starts and then the
voltage<00:01:56.440> starts<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.800> drop<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.010> little<00:01:57.250> bit<00:01:57.400> and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
voltage starts to drop a little bit and

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150 
voltage starts to drop a little bit and
then<00:01:58.270> it'll<00:01:58.420> settle<00:01:58.659> down<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.080> about<00:01:59.229> 21<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.100> a

emissions<00:05:44.490> test<00:05:44.850> I<00:05:45.540> recently<00:05:46.380> went<00:05:46.770> through

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
emissions test I recently went through

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.300 
emissions test I recently went through
the<00:05:47.160> emissions<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.229> I<00:05:49.520> scored<00:05:50.520> zero<00:05:51.300> carbon

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
the emissions and I scored zero carbon

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.120 
the emissions and I scored zero carbon
dioxide<00:05:53.310> at<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:54.150> exhaust<00:05:54.449> and<00:05:55.050> only<00:05:55.650> seven

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
dioxide at the exhaust and only seven

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.680 
dioxide at the exhaust and only seven
parts<00:05:56.520> per<00:05:56.760> million<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.389> cruse<00:05:58.350> of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
parts per million a cruse of

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.439 
parts per million a cruse of
hydrocarbons<00:06:01.130> so<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.310> was<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.460> major<00:06:03.030> pass

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
hydrocarbons so that was a major pass

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.270 
hydrocarbons so that was a major pass
