 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki 

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:15.082
 and I would like to discuss the issue of sick leave and ZUS control in this video, but people marked on sick leave 

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:25.343
 category III, unfortunately, people of category III, for our Social Security Institution, namely representatives of uniformed services, 

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:28.713
 in this case, a professional soldier. 

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:40.309
 It's mainly about ZUS control and traditionally, the inspiration here is to ask one of my readers. 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.282
 "Hello, Doctor, my name is Tomasz, I am from Pułtusk and this is the Masovia Province. 

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:52.172
 But to the point: I am a professional soldier in the contract service. 

00:00:52.606 --> 00:01:00.447
 In January 2011, I had surgery for right right inguinal hernia with a synthetic implant. 

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:07.138
 I have been on sick leave since March 24, 2011. 

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:14.045
 Such a date of treatment was given to me by a doctor from the hospital and he wrote me these exemptions. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.974
 Today, to my surprise, I received a letter from ZUS at my home address, directing me to examine the medical examiner's office 

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:30.413
 Social Insurance Institution on March 16, 2011. 

00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:39.974
 You can explain to me the reason for such a study, what they require, I have heard that uniformed services matter differently 

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:41.740
 with ZUS. 

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:54.470
 From what I remember, on the sick leave, he marked ZUS payer, which is one, and once when I had a broken arm it was different 

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:58.210
 selection, i.e. the payer was three. 

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:03.950
 Thank you in advance for your reply, best regards, YouTube videos - great thing. " 

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:15.180
 Well, thanks for a couple of compliments, but this is probably my mistake for the doctor issuing the release and 

00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:18.750
 entering the three of them explains everything. 

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:27.270
 I can not rule out, because I have such cases that sometimes the unit commanders do not have any effective tools themselves 

00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:40.540
 on their subordinate abusing medical exemptions, they write applications to ZUS and use ZUS to control this release. 

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:42.210
 What would I do? 

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:50.570
 I would just call that ZUS, I'm sure there's a phone number down there that's writing to the Lord 

00:02:50.567 --> 00:03:01.340
 sent, explained that you are a soldier in this contract service and it should be enough, but you can 

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:06.830
 go to that ZUS and say the same during this check. 

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:20.480
 Well, here I just got a second answer from our Lord Tomek and decided: "I'm on vacation, that I can walk, 

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:22.400
 so let me go and explain. 

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:34.280
 And one more thing: should doctors check out another payer at every release, in other words 3, in which case my own? 

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:38.030
 Is this caused by a doctor's ignorance or other factor? 

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:46.580
 In the case of the hand I mentioned, the doctor pointed out what she wrote to write 3, from what I heard- 

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:49.450
 // Why do you want the boy to walk ... //. 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:54.000
 You should tell the doctor how he does not know about it. " 

00:03:54.002 --> 00:04:01.280
 Well, Mr. Tomek ... nothing can be closer to the truth and basically the Lord himself answered his question. 

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:10.570
 It is worth it if we are a contract, professional or some other soldier, and let us remember - there are no separate forms of dismissal 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:22.380
 doctors only for soldiers, please note: doctor, nurse, or how you are addressing, I am 

00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:31.010
 professional, contract or other soldier and please enter 3 where the payer is written. 

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.940
 So 3 means another payer for ZUS. 

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:43.770
 And in this case, the control of a professional soldier from the Social Insurance Institution is unlikely. 

00:04:45.173 --> 00:04:54.700
 Your Darek Kraśnicki from Wroclaw said, however, if you still had such control, you were dismissed, 

00:04:55.368 --> 00:05:04.440
 of course being a professional soldier or some other you can be an contributor to my forum www.zwolnienielekarskie.pl 

00:05:04.443 --> 00:05:11.470
 describe how this situation was resolved, whether you returned to work, any answer would be appreciated.
