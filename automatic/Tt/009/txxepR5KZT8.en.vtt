here it is generated from the bottom and
it's<00:02:15.080> very<00:02:15.290> small<00:02:15.620> bubbles<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.160> they<00:02:16.250> take<00:02:16.460> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
over the start your pump back now it's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.180

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
of tank there's a good picture there's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.580 
of tank there's a good picture there's
what<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.979> valves<00:04:38.370> open<00:04:39.199> can<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.289> see<00:04:40.470> all

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
what the valves open can you see all

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.070 
what the valves open can you see all
that<00:04:40.770> oxygen<00:04:40.949> that's<00:04:41.699> all<00:04:42.060> being<00:04:42.479> reduced<00:04:42.870> in

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that oxygen that's all being reduced in

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.870 
that oxygen that's all being reduced in
the<00:04:43.169> law<00:04:43.229> I'm<00:04:43.500> going<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.710> shut<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.039> valve<00:04:44.220> you

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the law I'm going to shut the valve you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:56.089 
the law I'm going to shut the valve you
can<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.590> star<00:04:46.590> shuttle<00:04:46.830> valve

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.799 

and<00:04:57.099> some<00:04:57.309> of<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.729> just<00:04:57.969> picking<00:04:58.180> oxygen

00:04:58.799 --> 00:04:58.809 
and some of that is just picking oxygen

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:00.450 
and some of that is just picking oxygen
up<00:04:58.930> because<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.409> water<00:04:59.620> level<00:05:00.039> has<00:05:00.129> fallen

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
up because the water level has fallen

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.029 
up because the water level has fallen
below<00:05:00.900> where<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.020> first<00:05:02.289> hole<00:05:02.529> on<00:05:02.559> the<00:05:02.830> riser

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
below where the first hole on the riser

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.350 
below where the first hole on the riser
is<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:03.909> acts<00:05:04.059> as<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> vacuum<00:05:04.779> there<00:05:06.210> as<00:05:07.210> you

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
is so it acts as a vacuum there as you

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.409 
is so it acts as a vacuum there as you
open<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.749> valve<00:05:08.669> let's<00:05:09.669> just<00:05:09.939> cover<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
open the valve let's just cover the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.589 
open the valve let's just cover the
oxygen<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.319> mean<00:05:12.129> you<00:05:12.249> got<00:05:12.400> plenty<00:05:12.639> of<00:05:12.819> oxygen

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
oxygen I mean you got plenty of oxygen

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.119 
oxygen I mean you got plenty of oxygen
now<00:05:14.379> shut<00:05:14.800> another<00:05:15.430> thing<00:05:15.669> that's<00:05:15.819> important

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
now shut another thing that's important

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.189 
now shut another thing that's important
inside<00:05:18.129> the<00:05:18.339> tank<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:19.240> hardly<00:05:19.599> see<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:19.900> will

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
inside the tank you hardly see it will

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.230 
inside the tank you hardly see it will
bring<00:05:20.409> us<00:05:20.529> down<00:05:21.300> maybe<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.479> can<00:05:22.719> and<00:05:22.990> on<00:05:24.240> this

where<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> like<00:05:28.569> to<00:05:28.599> feel<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:28.960> water<00:05:30.839> so<00:05:31.839> that's

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
where I like to feel the water so that's

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.510 
where I like to feel the water so that's
it<00:05:32.229> it's<00:05:32.439> going<00:05:32.529> to<00:05:32.589> let<00:05:32.740> it<00:05:32.800> drain<00:05:32.949> down<00:05:33.189> it'll

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
it it's going to let it drain down it'll

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.619 
it it's going to let it drain down it'll
take<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.729> down<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:33.999> about<00:05:34.149> an<00:05:34.270> inch<00:05:34.419> in<00:05:34.539> the

bond you just pick it up and dump it

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.119 
bond you just pick it up and dump it
over<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.009> side<00:05:37.080> that's<00:05:38.080> all<00:05:38.229> we<00:05:38.379> caught<00:05:38.559> on
