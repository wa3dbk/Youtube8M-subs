manufacturers do this too they cut these

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
manufacturers do this too they cut these

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
tires and Vibram has done this to give

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
tires and Vibram has done this to give
these<00:01:50.610> shoes<00:01:50.670> extra<00:01:51.329> traction<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.439> five

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
these shoes extra traction the five

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.770 
these shoes extra traction the five

fingers cost between 75 and 85 dollars

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.569 
fingers cost between 75 and 85 dollars
now<00:01:55.470> whether<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.740> seems<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> lot<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
now whether that seems like a lot of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
now whether that seems like a lot of
money<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.540> money<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.079> depends

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
money or a little money to you depends

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.749 
money or a little money to you depends
on<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.740> feel<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:58.979> barefoot<00:01:59.579> running

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
on how you feel about barefoot running

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
on how you feel about barefoot running
ideally<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.840> should<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.290> able<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> kick

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
ideally you should just be able to kick

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.230 
ideally you should just be able to kick
off<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.890> shoes<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.310> run<00:02:02.700> outside<00:02:03.060> with

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
off your shoes and run outside with

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.850 
off your shoes and run outside with
naked<00:02:03.509> feet<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.469> would<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.740> totally

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
naked feet and that would be totally

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.859 
naked feet and that would be totally
free<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.149> other<00:02:06.270> hand<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.689> want<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
free on the other hand if you want to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.510 
free on the other hand if you want to
protect<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.409> feet<00:02:07.590> against<00:02:07.950> cuts<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
protect your feet against cuts and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.339 
protect your feet against cuts and
scrapes<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.179> stepping<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> dog<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.110> another

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
scrapes and stepping the dog to another

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.620 
scrapes and stepping the dog to another
now

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
now

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.900 
now
see<00:02:10.780> stuff<00:02:10.990> like<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:12.310> five<00:02:12.490> fingers<00:02:12.790> do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
see stuff like that the five fingers do

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.910 
see stuff like that the five fingers do
a<00:02:12.940> great<00:02:13.240> job<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.840> they<00:02:14.230> definitely<00:02:14.440> cost

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
a great job and they definitely cost

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.230 
a great job and they definitely cost
less<00:02:15.190> than<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> high-end<00:02:15.760> pair<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.060> running

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
less than a high-end pair of running

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.760 
less than a high-end pair of running
shoes<00:02:16.330> they'll<00:02:16.900> probably<00:02:17.200> last<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.590> lot<00:02:17.710> longer

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
shoes they'll probably last a lot longer

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.450 
shoes they'll probably last a lot longer
too

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
too

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.800 
too
so<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.670> we're<00:02:18.820> running<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.390> very<00:02:19.510> natural

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
so if we're running in a very natural

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.520 
so if we're running in a very natural
way<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> great<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.460> do<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.590
