00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.019
 now there are only three teams left 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.840
 today you will see here we will not 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.350
 the 40-inch model of the 7000 series lcd tv with LED illumination 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.439
 samsung 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.570
 this tv has full HD resolution and also multimedia player functions 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.859
 the name was modeled by what is claimed TV or the eninc 40 of 7 thousand 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.900
 as with all led lcd TVs 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 It's impossible to start talking about this tv. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.970
 without highlighting the design 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.080
 the use of the traditional fluorescent lamps instead of leaving the screen 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.680
 the TV is much thinner 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.800
 so the screen of this model is only three centimeters thick 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.090
 Another advantage of the doctor is a lower electric consumption 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.890
 we measure the energy expenditure said he feared he stayed in 101 matches 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.780
 a conventional lcd tv the same size as samsung itself 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.630
 practically doubles 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.989
 but what impresses even more on this TV are its functions as players 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.600
 it has a network port it comes with an adapter and it does 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.299
 of the two ways you can get on the internet to watch youtube videos 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.180
 check the weather forecast and receive news from the land portal on the tv screen 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.590
 in the case of youtube the good news is that you can now search for videos 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.320
 on the first lcd tv with samsung led and with an accessory tube as a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.909
 55-inch model tested by infolab does not exist search fortunately 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.409
 today the slide correcting these tevez with automatic update of the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.659
 TV network commissions also serve to access videos 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.110
 songs and photos that are home network computers 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.860
 in our tests we can be close to bias 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.520
 is that wmv videos who caught me with a two and four 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.150
 by the wired network and also there and does 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.740
 with some formats gave to watch videos in 1080p in a good by the wired network 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.170
 1080p videos also rolled over the wireless network 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.940
 but for them not to send so the network needs to be in the default uefa 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.470
 yen during the tests we noticed only two problems one of them was not 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.340
 uploading the subtitles pontaise richter for videos in acts of the other was 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.709
 not play videos in matroska format over the network 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.579
 but nevertheless we realize that both the subtitles and an exchange 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.810
 worked perfectly with the files were on a thumb drive or I walked 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.099
 external plugged into the usb port 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.030
 to connect the pen drive or hd you use one of the two tv usb ports 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.749
 the other usb port is reserved for the date theft is flawed 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.339
 the tv genre without conditions even me 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.479
 here you have four ports in this standard also gives to connect dvd 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:50.259
 players and other equipment using composite video component video cables 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.369
 only for this you will need these adapters 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.619
 the quality of images with blu-ray movies is great the image also not 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:02.759
 leaves nothing to be desired with the digital tv signal captured by the tv that lcd has 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.249
 contrast ratio of 3 million for one 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.879
 the response time of four thousand seconds and can work on 120 rebounds 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.999
 which bothers a little exaggerated reflection of the screen when ambient being 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.499
 with the lights on 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:21.010
 in addition the sound of the speakers is due to power this lcd tv with it 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.620
 can be found in stores for 5-7 131 reais 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:29.399
 not
