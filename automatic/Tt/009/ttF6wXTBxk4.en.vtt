someone who's spiraling down there
they're<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.309> coming<00:00:41.309> close<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> perhaps

having a heart attack or a stroke or
something<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.079> symptoms<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
something and there are symptoms that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.080 
something and there are symptoms that
are<00:00:48.050> accessible<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.760> missed

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
because no one is there with the skills

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
because no one is there with the skills
to<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:55.050> understand<00:00:55.620> what's<00:00:55.890> being<00:00:56.039> seen
