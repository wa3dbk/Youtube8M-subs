00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.500
 Someone will say that with the current 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.080
 there is no assortment of Christmas tree toys 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 no sense doing it yourself 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.330
 but agree much nicer if on 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.189
 family trees adorn several 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 toys made by you or your children 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.800
 To begin with the blue stick we twist 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.349
 ring shape and in that position 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 fix hot melt for those who did not know 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.230
 family stick is something like a brush 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 coiled wire now 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.010
 pick up colored paper and cut 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.530
 from it several long thin strips 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.379
 these strips will later become caps 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 for Santa Claus 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.680
 fix the cut stripes on 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.680
 inner ring perimeter 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.879
 on top of all these strips we connect in 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.879
 one 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.040
 and glue them to the rope which 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.170
 will act as a loop 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.190
 we mask the junction with large 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.159
 a pom-pom hat made a face beard 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.820
 Santa Claus's beard will be made similar 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.670
 way 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.509
 white stripes glue to the inside 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 perimeter of the ring 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.820
 and unlike the caps these strips are not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.640
 glue together 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.119
 and spin in the opposite direction on 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.350
 white cardboard draw a mustache and grandfather's face 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.570
 frost 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 we cut out the whiskers and leave them white 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.390
 Paint your face with a pink pencil. 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.070
 glue face and antennae designs 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.390
 add red pompon spout 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.090
 and eyes draw a black felt pen very 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.020
 simple and very easy grandfather frost 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.020
 completed 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720
