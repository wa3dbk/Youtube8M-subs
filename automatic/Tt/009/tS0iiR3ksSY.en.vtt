 John Cena, while you're lying there, hopefully as uncomfortable as you can be, I want you to listen to me. I want you to take this in, because before I go out in three weeks with the WWE Championship, I have a lot of things that I want to get out of my chest. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 I do not hate you, John. I do not even like you. I like you much more than most people back there. I hate ... this idea ... that you are the best ... because you are not. I am the best. I'm the best in the world. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 There's one thing you're better at than me, and that's kissing Vince McMahon's ass. You're as good at kissing Vince's ass as Hulk Hogan was. I do not know if you're as good as Dwayne ... he was very good at kissing ass ... as he always was and still is. Oops ... I'm breaking the fourth wall. I am the best fighter ... in the world. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I have been the best since the first day I arrived at this company, and I have been defamed and hated since that day because Paul Heyman saw something in me that no one else wanted to admit. It's true, I'm a man from Paul Heyman. You know who else was a Paul Heyman man? Brock Lesnar ... and he left, just like I'm leaving, but the big difference between Brock and me, is that I'll go with the WWE Championship 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Vincent K. McMahon's imaginary bronze rings have captured me so much that I finally realized that they are just that. They are completely imaginary. The only thing that is real is me, and the fact that day after day, for almost six years, I have proven to everyone in the world that I am the best with this microphone, in the ring, and even as a commentator. Nadia can touch me. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And yet, no matter how many times I try it, I'm not in your beloved collection cups, I'm not on the cover of the show, I'm hardly promoted, I do not get to be in movies, I'm not in any fucking show on the channel USA, I'm not in the WrestleMania poster, I'm not in the advertisement that is produced at the beginning of the program. I'm not going with Conan O'Brian, I'm not going with Jimmy Fallon, but it's a fact that I should be, and believe me, this is not sour grapes, but the fact that Dwayne is in the WrestleMania main event next year and I do not , me sick! 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Oh hey, let me clarify something, those of you who are cheering for me right now ... you are just a big reason why I am leaving, because you are the ones who are taking those collection cups right now, you are the ones who buy those programs in which my face does not appear on the cover, and then at five in the morning at the airport, you try to push it against my face thinking that you can get an autograph from me and then sell it on eBay because you are too lazy to get a real job 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 I'm going to go with the WWE Championship on July 17 and who knows, maybe I'll defend it in the New Japan Pro Wrestling ... or maybe I'll go back to Ring of Honor. Hey, Colt Cabana, how are you? ... The reason why I'm leaving is you, people. Because after I leave, you will continue to invest money in this company. I'm just part of the wheel, the wheel is going to keep turning. And I understand, I understand that Vince McMahon will continue to make money in spite of himself ... he is a millionaire who should be a billionaire ... do you know why he is not a billionaire? Because he surrounds himself with absurdities [...] Yes, men like John Lauranitis, who will tell him everything he wants to hear ... and I would like to think that maybe this company will be better after Vince McMahon is dead, but the fact is that it will be taken by his idiot daughter and his incompetent son-in-law and the rest of his stupid family. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Let me tell you a personal story about Vince McMahon. They know we're doing this whole anti-bullying campaign ...
