 Then I answer , I do not know if I would just not 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.429
 in the main plans, but then I 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.380
 I made a hate and did not even start thinking about 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.210
 content that was going to generate the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 we saw that if the people who 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 generated content only from minecraft beyond 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 of being a thing that was going to get tiresome 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 by the fact that the game is only 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.570
 vegetative playing is more or craft 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.489

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 placid othon 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 then he takes the contents of three weeks 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 just craft the content and end up 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.960
 fast 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.960
 Tite has lots to do. 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 realizing the producers of goats and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.170
 maps gave a stop for a year and a half of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 more year updates continued and ended 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 framed the tire cabanos is in europe 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.079

 I used the pixel series to good pixel I did not 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 I wanted to continue where I left off because 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.229
 I do not know, guys, it 's boring. 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.909
 I would have to do what is lost 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.890
 even because mooney robot was not good 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.660

 goal galax 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.760
 there and it was a very labor-intensive business 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.100
 because every time he would even ask 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.960
 because ninth and you owed me dig punch 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 and got involved 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.430
 but there's a catch hatred he did not stop 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.900
 details still 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.110
 only that it did not have any update that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.730
 it was going to happen in 2010 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.800
 Can we redo the series started? 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.860

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.360
 who has authorization to type cimpor 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.490
 It's wood , we 're serious. 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.130

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.450
 focus is asking this're working and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.660
 this will likely again be the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.490
 seventh cleiton will be different and you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.300
 will be able to participate with the 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.090
 maybe the country will even surprise 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.090
 Thank you very much for listening. 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.560
 so I guess that's it if you guys 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.660
 know some god type series something that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.820
 People look it was a goat pack if you can 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.280
 to call an option that is not something that 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.780
 everyone has already made the logical goal to be 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.100
 the update still gives a 3.5 point 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.870
 many updated and everyone has seen it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.560
 so dear, I think something 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.530
 innovative is something pretty hot mallet can 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.030
 be so map survivor left 19 and olic 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.620
 in the video description is critical because it 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.720
 let the avaí get some he will see 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.640
 that are cool if lived 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.620
 It's incredible beauty so I said I said that 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.180
 if I say I cut myself off from talking about 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.850
 to be 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.530
 so you think all day 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.170
 trying to make peace had when the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.290
 google all there asked the google voice 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.680
 and then the government took over not point 4 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 I think it 's still richman dovish 1.4 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.430
 So that's not what I think. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.290
 so look craft a cool game that's one 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 game that gives to do other things to 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.820
 cimpor and typhus exhausting those these 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.520
 two things we have to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.620
 diversify a little the games so the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.670
 channel will not see bin laden craft this 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.250
 fell trees in that 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.520
 We're going to want it to be the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.320
 channel but not so much but it will take 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.090
 to continue without which it is not so does not have 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.820
 You're going to stay the way you are. 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.140
 nerd geek shock omon believes that the 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.000
 We managed to make all the plans 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.880
 work will stay cool is six 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.310
 aces will love it and the pixel or if it 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.450
 has to update its rate accordingly. 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.890
 that once again the series is and I 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.810
