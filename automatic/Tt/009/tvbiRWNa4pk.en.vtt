00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.209 
when I went to medical school I was
pretty<00:00:06.660> much<00:00:06.870> told<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.500> unless<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.860> had<00:00:08.010> some

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:08.219 
pretty much told but unless you had some

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.310 
pretty much told but unless you had some
rare<00:00:08.460> genetic<00:00:08.759> condition<00:00:09.059> or<00:00:09.839> lived<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.230> the

rare genetic condition or lived in the
third<00:00:10.349> world<00:00:10.799> you<00:00:11.190> know<00:00:11.249> there<00:00:11.370> was<00:00:11.490> really<00:00:11.730> no

third world you know there was really no

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.159 
third world you know there was really no
reason<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.360> anyone<00:00:12.599> would<00:00:12.780> ever<00:00:12.839> need

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:13.169 
reason that anyone would ever need

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.619 
reason that anyone would ever need
vitamins<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.249> our<00:00:14.369> diets<00:00:14.789> are<00:00:14.910> very<00:00:15.150> healthy

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
vitamins that our diets are very healthy

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.089 
vitamins that our diets are very healthy
and<00:00:15.749> we<00:00:15.869> get<00:00:16.020> everything<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.590> need<00:00:16.619> from<00:00:16.800> our

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:20.429 
food but in fact what we know is there

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.310 
food but in fact what we know is there
actually<00:00:20.849> are<00:00:21.000> quite<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> few<00:00:21.509> people<00:00:21.810> who<00:00:22.109> have

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
actually are quite a few people who have

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.710 
actually are quite a few people who have
various<00:00:23.009> vitamin<00:00:23.640> deficiencies<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.570> there's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
various vitamin deficiencies and there's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.259 
various vitamin deficiencies and there's
several<00:00:24.960> reasons<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.939> one<00:00:26.939> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
several reasons for that one very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
several reasons for that one very
important<00:00:27.779> nutrient<00:00:28.259> that<00:00:28.380> I've<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.619> found<00:00:28.919> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
important nutrient that I've I found to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.679 
important nutrient that I've I found to
be<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.490> important<00:00:29.999> with<00:00:30.119> weight<00:00:30.419> management

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
be very important with weight management

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.229 
be very important with weight management
and<00:00:31.289> blood<00:00:31.679> sugar<00:00:31.710> regulation<00:00:32.400> which<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.940> very

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and blood sugar regulation which is very

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
and blood sugar regulation which is very
important<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:33.989> insulin<00:00:34.440> resistance

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
important with this insulin resistance

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.450 
important with this insulin resistance
is<00:00:35.070> vitamin<00:00:35.460> D<00:00:35.989> vitamin<00:00:36.989> D<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.710> made<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
is vitamin D vitamin D is made in this

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840 
is vitamin D vitamin D is made in this
in<00:00:38.730> our<00:00:38.879> skin<00:00:39.300> from<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> Sun<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> don't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
in our skin from the Sun so you don't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.549 
in our skin from the Sun so you don't
actually<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.629> take<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.260> diet

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
actually have to take it in from diet

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
actually have to take it in from diet
but<00:00:44.690> we<00:00:45.690> live<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.320> Florida<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.760> test

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but we live here in Florida and I test

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
but we live here in Florida and I test
my<00:00:48.300> patience<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.199> found<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> low

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
my patience because I found that low

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
my patience because I found that low
levels<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> vitamin<00:00:50.969> D<00:00:51.079> actually<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
levels of vitamin D actually make it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
levels of vitamin D actually make it
hard<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.769> somebody<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.399> lose<00:00:53.579> weight<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
hard for somebody to lose weight and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
hard for somebody to lose weight and
replacing<00:00:55.170> them<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> optimal<00:00:55.920> levels<00:00:56.250> help

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
replacing them to optimal levels help

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.810 
replacing them to optimal levels help
and<00:00:57.390> many<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.500> patients<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.219> deficient<00:00:59.699> in

reasons<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.640> older<00:01:51.000> our

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
reasons for that as we get older our

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.999 
reasons for that as we get older our
stomach<00:01:51.600> acid<00:01:51.960> decreases<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.829> don't

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
stomach acid decreases so we don't

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.850 
stomach acid decreases so we don't
absorb<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.579> b12<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.780> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> medications

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
absorb the b12 and a lot of medications

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.120 
absorb the b12 and a lot of medications
affect<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.490> ability<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> absorb<00:01:57.539> b12<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.680> lot

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
affect the ability to absorb b12 a lot

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
other conditions which affect the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.550 
other conditions which affect the
absorption<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.610> b12<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.659> replacing<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
absorption of b12 so replacing that is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 
absorption of b12 so replacing that is
important<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:09.150> find<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.870> of<00:02:09.990> my

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
important I also find that a lot of my

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.900 
important I also find that a lot of my
patients<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.590> low<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.950> magnesium<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
patients are low in magnesium and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.090 
patients are low in magnesium and
magnesium<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:13.230> very<00:02:13.440> important<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.010> again

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
magnesium is very important and again

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.490 
magnesium is very important and again
this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
whole glucose insulin pathway so I test

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.800 
whole glucose insulin pathway so I test
all<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.460> patients<00:02:18.730> for<00:02:19.150> those<00:02:19.450> specific

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
all of my patients for those specific

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.500 
all of my patients for those specific
nutrients<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.950> often<00:02:21.730> find<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.030> they're<00:02:22.240> low

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
nutrients I often find that they're low

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.290 
nutrients I often find that they're low
and<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.200> replace<00:02:23.650> them<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:25.060> like

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
and I replace them because just like

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.050 
and I replace them because just like
that<00:02:25.600> cell<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.230> was<00:02:26.410> low<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.430> sugar<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that cell that was low in sugar and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.480 
that cell that was low in sugar and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540

things<00:02:35.050> working<00:02:35.440> against<00:02:35.860> us<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:37.450> certain

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
things working against us I have certain

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.370 
things working against us I have certain
recommendations<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.850> actually<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.930> think<00:02:41.230> that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
recommendations I actually do think that

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.650 
recommendations I actually do think that
most<00:02:41.620> people<00:02:41.800> do<00:02:42.310> need<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.550> multivitamin<00:02:43.060> our

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
most people do need a multivitamin our

farming<00:02:44.560> practices<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:45.340> changed<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.120> lot<00:02:46.330> of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
farming practices have changed a lot of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.260 
farming practices have changed a lot of
vegetables<00:02:47.620> these<00:02:48.130> days<00:02:48.430> don't<00:02:48.700> contain<00:02:49.090> as

vegetables these days don't contain as

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
many nutrients as they did years ago

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.729 
many nutrients as they did years ago
because<00:02:51.750> magnesium<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.959> certain<00:02:53.350> minerals

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
because magnesium and certain minerals

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.100 
because magnesium and certain minerals
are<00:02:53.920> not<00:02:54.070> replaced<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.820> soil<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> find

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
are not replaced to the soil so I find

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.750 
are not replaced to the soil so I find
most<00:02:56.410> people<00:02:56.800> do<00:02:56.950> need<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.130> good<00:02:57.220> multivitamin

it low and I find that fish oil can
really<00:03:18.549> be<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> very<00:03:19.150> helpful<00:03:19.390> supplement<00:03:19.780> the
