00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
all the settings that you need to change

all the settings that you need to change
for<00:01:45.729> going<00:01:45.940> out<00:01:46.060> again<00:01:46.270> from<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.600> pits

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
for going out again from the pits

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.660 
for going out again from the pits
because<00:01:47.050> then<00:01:47.440> you'll<00:01:47.620> be<00:01:47.770> probably<00:01:48.040> on<00:01:48.220> new

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
because then you'll be probably on new

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.980 
because then you'll be probably on new
tires<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.300> you'll<00:01:49.450> be<00:01:49.540> able<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.720> go<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> lot

fitted with a special wheel nut system
which<00:02:22.660> has<00:02:22.840> been<00:02:23.080> designed<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.620> enable<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
which has been designed to enable the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.820 
which has been designed to enable the
execution<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.940> even<00:02:25.330> faster<00:02:25.870> safer<00:02:26.170> pit<00:02:26.530> stops

this<00:02:27.489> system<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.060> actually<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.840> changed<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
this system is actually we changed the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.320 
this system is actually we changed the
way<00:02:29.410> owner<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.860> well<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> wheel<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.730> the

way owner as well as the wheel and the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.720 
way owner as well as the wheel and the
willna<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.959> actually<00:02:32.350> integrated<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
willna is actually integrated in the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.870 
willna is actually integrated in the
world<00:02:33.910> itself<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:36.010> similar<00:02:36.519> system<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
world itself it's a similar system to

change<00:02:40.390> both<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.350> wheel<00:02:41.500> nut<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:41.980> world

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
change both the wheel nut and the world
