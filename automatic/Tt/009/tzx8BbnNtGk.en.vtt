one of the important things that you
need<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:35.980> know<00:00:36.160> is<00:00:36.430> which<00:00:36.910> amplifier<00:00:37.480> is<00:00:37.629> which

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
need to know is which amplifier is which

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.930 
need to know is which amplifier is which
and<00:00:38.170> there<00:00:38.920> are<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.040> few<00:00:39.220> ways<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:39.460> be<00:00:39.730> able<00:00:39.820> to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
and there are a few ways to be able to

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.090 
and there are a few ways to be able to
do<00:00:40.120> this<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:41.410> notice<00:00:41.590> there's<00:00:41.860> an<00:00:41.980> auto

there all time to tell me that's the one

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.640 
there all time to tell me that's the one
that<00:00:52.780> I'm<00:00:52.900> locating<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.470> one<00:00:53.559> I'm

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
that I'm locating the one I'm

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.600 
that I'm locating the one I'm
controlling<00:00:56.909> what<00:00:57.909> I<00:00:57.940> also<00:00:58.300> can<00:00:58.480> do<00:00:59.369> is<00:01:00.369> if<00:01:00.549> I

process happens if I click on an item

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.149 
process happens if I click on an item
it'll<00:01:14.020> start<00:01:14.260> blinking<00:01:14.439> on<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.740> front<00:01:14.950> panel

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
it'll start blinking on the front panel

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.850 
it'll start blinking on the front panel
and<00:01:15.430> then<00:01:16.330> they<00:01:16.540> have<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.720> ability<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.260> move

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
and then they have the ability to move

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.280 
and then they have the ability to move
them<00:01:18.070> around<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.640> also<00:01:19.630> have<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.900> ability<00:01:19.990> to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
them around I also have the ability to

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.859 
them around I also have the ability to
assign<00:01:20.770> names<00:01:21.189> to<00:01:21.430> these<00:01:21.670> devices<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.390> if<00:01:22.780> I

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
assign names to these devices so if I
