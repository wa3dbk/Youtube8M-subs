00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello everyone tankers with you hamish and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.010
 Today we have a video with update 088 well 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.030
 more precisely with the test update 088 is quite 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.679
 really what will still be wrong when 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.480
 there will be an update here and now I will give you 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.320
 show tanchik 43 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.810
 it is located on the sixth level here and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 I would like to mention its main advantages 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.640
 like a pretty interesting 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 dynamic characteristics that's strength 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.710
 which is better than the t-34 85 as for me 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.309
 this competitor will be a very worthy t-34 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.420
 85 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.010
 it will be no worse even in something better 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 Now tell about the characteristics we 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 my platoon and we go to battle and estimate 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 This machine strength seven hundred 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.699
 thirty units more than t-34 85 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 well, just a little weight of 28 tons 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.379
 even very good and engine power at 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.750
 this 600 horsepower is very good 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.899
 separate muscles from it turns out to be honored 22 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.450
 horses per ton maximum speed 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 55 kilometers per hour is just fine 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 there will be a fast machine and speed just 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 highway 44 degrees is also very beautiful 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 good performance booking body 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 60 millimeters in the forehead 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 which is better than the t-34 85 45 in the sides 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.860
 and 40 in feed that so so well, cardboard in 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.110
 general tower 75 75 75 very good 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 turret as for me this will be very 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.909
 ricochet especially in the airborne mask 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.850
 It takes a lot of space but the tower to 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.570
 top spoils everything 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.090
 I put the gun by tapping which 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.700
 us with 54 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.700
 although I guess I made a mistake on better 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.759
 put here on i will put it resist 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.259
 4 here it is still better now we will stop 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:00.180
 how to it so that's how something about 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.550
 so let's say yes that's all 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.710
 Yes, not all shells are charged for 1 year 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.950
 now everything is quite equipment ok here 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.640
 so here 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.070
 gun here 4 everyone knows but over e52 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.990
 used to be now on mt-25 but there is on 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.250
 t-28 is over 4 on many common tanks 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.770
 normal tool is quite a good 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.410
 the exact here is its characteristics already 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.920
 showed think everyone knows it makes no sense 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.470
 talk them here in general port speed 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.120
 towers 48 degrees per second which is very 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.520
 good is also very fast yes and the range 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.650
 communication 525 meters is also very good 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.030
 the radio at the level we'll see hours of battle 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.860
 appreciate the fight don't know how about throw off 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.040
 Fifth levels Nashi have enough people 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.739
 most likely in top 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.120
 here with me my friend robert great 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.120
 Expert I think many know him 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.560
 throws somehow slowly 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.080
 I do not know what will happen when I am German 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.290
 test new there 4 levels 5 need more 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.450
 will throw longer okay then 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.450
 let's see what the same combat missions 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.459
 interesting here threw the class to the eight 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.739
 I threw up the fight already in advance of the guys 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.260
 if i live at least two minutes it 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.930
 it will be good here and do not be offended 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.280
 but here and so threw anything guests 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 do but honestly outwardly a-43 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.440
 very so beautiful i like the look 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.799
 such a cool tank as you robert 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:43.350
 at least outwardly if you break earlier 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.160
 what am i beautiful down beautiful such 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.160
 true sovochek 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.830
 So 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.579
 too many 416 of their objects are they damn 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.439
 two shots are better for us than gold 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.129
 I 'll charge right away 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.129
 traffic jam 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.000
 even so 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.900
 I'd rather act mouth masturbate but dynamics 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.600
 by the way some kind of weak robots 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.270
 I noticed that the dynamics seems to be good 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.140
 power density is good but something 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:34.010
 Well, not so impressive let's say others 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:39.620
 typewriter 416th object seriously 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:43.370
 rather weak well normal for haircuts by 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.480
 least not german st spins 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.770
 very good, I fell a little bit from the mountain 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.110
 hurt my case 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.610
 by the way 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:59.240
 in the distance I see the first article 416 of the bay there 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.590
 break even so well here already closer to 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.370
 the truth when told them not to 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.030
 punched so who is there with us 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.430
 way way 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:14.510
 all now replenish the buds ricochet 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.710
 ricochet passed yes I deserve it not 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.140

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.560
 that I merge well yes yes with this 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.950
 scenario is very hard to test at all 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.950
 anything 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.250
 I hope she will not die now 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:54.380
 ok okay, they punch me along the side 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:56.060
 guys really hard to test 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.890
 machine in this situation that's when 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:06.340
 you get to the feet of the eighth level well 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:11.030
 sigh guys here is such a-43 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.070
