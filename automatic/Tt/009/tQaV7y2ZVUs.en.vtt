00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
what I used to secure the ends because

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.850 
what I used to secure the ends because
it<00:02:56.300> doesn't<00:02:56.600> like<00:02:56.750> crimp<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.470> hair<00:02:57.620> really

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
it doesn't like crimp the hair really

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.620 
it doesn't like crimp the hair really
badly<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.580> regular<00:02:58.820> hair<00:02:59.180> tie<00:02:59.420> would

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
badly like a regular hair tie would

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.030 
badly like a regular hair tie would
because<00:02:59.900> all<00:02:59.959> regular<00:03:00.260> hair<00:03:00.470> ties<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:00.860> much

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
because all regular hair ties like much

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.790 
because all regular hair ties like much
thicker<00:03:01.340> um<00:03:02.020> but<00:03:03.020> it<00:03:03.140> holds<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.470> really<00:03:03.650> well

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
thicker um but it holds it really well

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.690 
thicker um but it holds it really well
