00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
black button it's actually not this one
this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:52.110> pass-through

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this is just a pass-through

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
this is just a pass-through
so<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.489> press<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.840> turn<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.140> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so it comes to this little chintzy piece

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.200 
so it comes to this little chintzy piece
of<00:01:00.960> plastic<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.620> allows<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> dock<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.760> if

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of plastic that allows it to dock on if

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
of plastic that allows it to dock on if
you<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> although<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.650> sure<00:01:04.710> why

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you would want to cuz when you just use

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
you would want to cuz when you just use
the<00:01:07.770> full<00:01:07.950> keyboard

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the full keyboard

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.750 
the full keyboard
I<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:09.900> prefer<00:01:10.170> using<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.070> wireless

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
I actually prefer using the wireless

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.149 
I actually prefer using the wireless
without<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.900> numeric<00:01:13.200> keypad<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.799> yes

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
without the the numeric keypad but yes

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
without the the numeric keypad but yes
sometimes<00:01:14.729> having<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> numeric<00:01:15.330> keypad<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
sometimes having a numeric keypad is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
sometimes having a numeric keypad is
useful<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.770> there<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.700> looks<00:01:18.000> pretty

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
useful so there you go it looks pretty

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.039 
useful so there you go it looks pretty
good<00:01:18.930> together<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.880> once<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> now

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
good together there and once it's on now

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
good together there and once it's on now
when<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> press<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.729> most<00:01:23.939> little

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
when you press it on the most little

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
when you press it on the most little
green<00:01:24.360> light<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.500> activate<00:01:26.009> your

digress<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.380> sitting<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.770> my
