web<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.790> all<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.120> did<00:00:15.420> basically<00:00:15.750> was

web on this I'm all I did basically was
just<00:00:16.500> little<00:00:16.680> squiggly<00:00:17.279> lines<00:00:18.109> going

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
just little squiggly lines going

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.779 
just little squiggly lines going
horizontal<00:00:20.490> across<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.210> finger<00:00:22.699> trying<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
horizontal across the finger trying to

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.990 
horizontal across the finger trying to
emulate<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.449> spider<00:00:24.779> web<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> did

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
emulate a spider web and then I did

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
emulate a spider web and then I did
about<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.660> those<00:00:27.930> lines<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.680> joined

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
about for those lines and then I joined

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.150 
about for those lines and then I joined
them<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.090> vertical<00:00:30.359> line<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
them with a vertical line so going the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
them with a vertical line so going the
opposite<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:33.020> just<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.149> simulate<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
opposite way just to kind of simulate a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
opposite way just to kind of simulate a
spider<00:00:36.660> web<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:40.020> pretty<00:00:40.379> simple

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
to do squiggly lines one way and

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
to do squiggly lines one way and
straight<00:00:46.559> lines<00:00:46.829> kind<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> straightish<00:00:47.969> lines
