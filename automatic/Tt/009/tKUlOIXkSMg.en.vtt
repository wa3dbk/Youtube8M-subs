630<00:02:06.540> watt<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.229> lot<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:08.220> sound

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
630 watt so that's a lot of good sound

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699 
630 watt so that's a lot of good sound

system called clarify this is a audio
technology<00:02:13.739> that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
technology that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
technology that
actually<00:02:14.160> tries<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.730> bring<00:02:15.300> back<00:02:15.599> some<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
actually tries to bring back some of the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.960 
actually tries to bring back some of the
lost<00:02:16.260> sound<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:17.010> highly<00:02:17.370> compressed<00:02:17.790> audio

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
lost sound in highly compressed audio

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
lost sound in highly compressed audio
files<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.050> I've<00:02:19.110> noticed<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.760> audio

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
files but I've noticed that the audio

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.460 
files but I've noticed that the audio
sounds<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.360> lot<00:02:21.510> better<00:02:21.569> when<00:02:21.959> plugged<00:02:22.230> into

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
sounds a lot better when plugged into

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800 
sounds a lot better when plugged into
the<00:02:22.620> USB<00:02:22.860> port<00:02:23.060> rather<00:02:24.060> than<00:02:24.360> playing<00:02:24.569> through

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the USB port rather than playing through

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.850 
the USB port rather than playing through
bluetooth<00:02:25.110> streaming<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.500> think<00:02:25.709> that's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
bluetooth streaming I think that's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.680 
bluetooth streaming I think that's
because<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.040> reconstructing<00:02:26.940> some<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.599> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
because it's reconstructing some of the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
because it's reconstructing some of the
lost<00:02:27.900> details<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.709> compressed<00:02:29.190> audio<00:02:29.459> files

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
lost details in compressed audio files

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.180 
lost details in compressed audio files
so<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.680> what<00:02:31.800> happens<00:02:31.950> when

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so I like that now see what happens when

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.120 
so I like that now see what happens when
I<00:02:32.280> put<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.640> reverse<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.130> nicely

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
I put it in reverse I get this nicely

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.040 
I put it in reverse I get this nicely

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
detailed surround view camera system so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.050 
detailed surround view camera system so

buttons to get different views I can see

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.839 
buttons to get different views I can see
straight<00:02:42.750> behind<00:02:42.989> me<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:44.069> see<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> corner<00:02:44.700> of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
I mentioned the 2-liter four-cylinder

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.020 
I mentioned the 2-liter four-cylinder
engine<00:03:17.530> under<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.860> hood<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.520> car<00:03:18.760> that's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
engine under the hood of this car that's

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.730 
engine under the hood of this car that's
got<00:03:19.240> direct<00:03:19.600> injection<00:03:20.110> as<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.560> other

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
got direct injection as do the other

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.310 
got direct injection as do the other
engine<00:03:21.460> options<00:03:21.640> for<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.390> Sorento<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.200> it

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
engine options for the Sorento and it

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080 
engine options for the Sorento and it
also<00:03:23.440> has<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> turbocharger<00:03:24.490> so<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.820> gets<00:03:24.970> us

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
also has a turbocharger so that gets us

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.720 
also has a turbocharger so that gets us
240<00:03:26.080> horsepower<00:03:26.200> 260<00:03:27.190> pound<00:03:27.430> feet<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.610> torque

240 horsepower 260 pound feet of torque

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.030 
240 horsepower 260 pound feet of torque
which<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.180> decent<00:03:29.020> for<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:29.470> vehicle<00:03:29.650> almost

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
which is decent for this vehicle almost

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.670 
which is decent for this vehicle almost
up<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> levels<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.270> v6<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:32.320> mated

we've<00:03:35.380> got<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> manual<00:03:35.920> mode<00:03:36.100> here<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:36.580> can

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
we've got a manual mode here so I can

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.370 
we've got a manual mode here so I can
choose<00:03:36.970> gears<00:03:37.360> that<00:03:37.570> takes<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.900> place<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.110> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
low range idea so if I need 3rd gear 2nd

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.450 
low range idea so if I need 3rd gear 2nd
gear<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.990> can<00:03:41.200> choose<00:03:41.500> those<00:03:41.740> this<00:03:42.220> goes

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the greatest members in the world I'm

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.830 
the greatest members in the world I'm
driving<00:04:14.830> this<00:04:14.950> car<00:04:15.190> I've<00:04:15.460> noticed<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.330> it

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
driving this car I've noticed that it

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.020 
driving this car I've noticed that it
doesn't<00:04:17.110> really<00:04:17.200> take<00:04:17.380> out<00:04:17.500> very<00:04:17.709> fast<00:04:18.070> when

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
doesn't really take out very fast when

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.000 
doesn't really take out very fast when
you're<00:04:19.390> making<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.750> rolling<00:04:20.140> acceleration<00:04:20.830> so

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
you're making a rolling acceleration so

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.280 
you're making a rolling acceleration so
right<00:04:21.160> now<00:04:21.280> I'll<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.580> punch<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.810> it

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
right now I'll just punch it and it

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.660 
right now I'll just punch it and it
takes<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.560> little<00:04:23.680> while<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.920> pick<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.490> and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
takes a little while to pick up and

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.930 
takes a little while to pick up and
that's<00:04:24.730> because<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.620> automatic

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that's because the automatic

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.940 
that's because the automatic
transmission<00:04:27.940> takes<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.180> little<00:04:28.300> while<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.950> add

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
transmission takes a little while to add

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.760 
transmission takes a little while to add
the<00:04:30.340> extra<00:04:30.730> mm<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.260> need<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.530> takes<00:04:32.740> a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
the extra mm that you need it takes a

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.680 
the extra mm that you need it takes a
little<00:04:32.890> while<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.100> ship<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:34.240> got<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.600> say

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
little while to ship down I got to say

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.810 
little while to ship down I got to say
overall<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.080> driving<00:04:36.010> character<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.550> the

overall the driving character of the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.390 
overall the driving character of the
