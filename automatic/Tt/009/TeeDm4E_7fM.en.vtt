00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 we start it we play with friends 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.489

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.579
 we see servers for different versions of us 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.840

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.370
 choose michroft sulfur for version 1 62 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 Well, for example, I will choose this one here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 build servers from dev and some 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.379
 and bronski we look what plugin here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 Authorization set automatically 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.130
 autosave message is generally all that 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.650
 we need to have fun playing 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 just swing the server after we 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.420
 I downloaded the server I have already downloaded 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 we take out the archive some daddy and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 see before him open it now 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 open this folder and these are all 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 files we need not sheathe and attention but 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 so these are all the files we need just 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.939
 select in the same folder and drag 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.270
 Now we need to configure the server 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.820
 look at the construction site means 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 open the properties server with any 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.409
 text documents so this is mine 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.610
 tanks left and any text 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.610
 documents and find such a line 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.380
 ip server here you enter your ip 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.540

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.650
 understand and just enter your api 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.750
 I will not describe my reason for that 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.810
 it means that we enter and enter ip 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 port whose ports are closed can it 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.200
 write 25 on with five hundred fifty five 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 fifty five so 2555 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.900
 that is, when connected, your friend should 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.530
 will lead the following api addresses 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.360
 so here then put a colon and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.930
 lead twenty five five hundred fifty 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.660
