00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
part and it did heal dogs all the way

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.720 
part and it did heal dogs all the way
how<00:00:15.929> about<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.800> uh<00:00:16.830> if<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.490> know<00:00:17.609> your

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
how about that but uh if you know your

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090 
how about that but uh if you know your
strategies<00:00:18.180> well<00:00:18.590> basically<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> have

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
strategies well basically all you have

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.439 
strategies well basically all you have
to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> wait<00:00:20.580> till<00:00:20.730> he<00:00:20.789> turns<00:00:20.910> towards<00:00:21.300> you

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
to do is wait till he turns towards you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.730 
to do is wait till he turns towards you
you<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.750> want<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.050> by<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.320> fire<00:00:22.529> because

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you don't want to get by as fire because

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.439 
you don't want to get by as fire because
it<00:00:22.800> hurts<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.970> don't<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
it hurts a lot and you don't want to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.640 
it hurts a lot and you don't want to
have<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> heal<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
have to heal because then you have a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.140 
have to heal because then you have a
chance<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.220> by<00:00:26.340> his<00:00:26.460> fire<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
chance to be here by his fire because of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.429 
chance to be here by his fire because of
that<00:00:27.269> stupid<00:00:27.539> mechanic<00:00:28.050> where<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.260> rub

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that stupid mechanic where they rub

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
that stupid mechanic where they rub
their<00:00:28.470> stomachs<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> just<00:00:30.779> wait<00:00:30.900> till<00:00:31.109> he's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
their stomachs so just wait till he's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.530 
their stomachs so just wait till he's
about<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> blow<00:00:31.859> fire<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> then<00:00:33.120> run

about to blow fire at you and then run

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
about to blow fire at you and then run
to<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> other<00:00:33.840> side<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> need<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to the other side and if you need to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
to the other side and if you need to
heal<00:00:36.059> then<00:00:36.329> he'll<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> need<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> shoot

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
heal then he'll and if you need to shoot

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
them then shoot them we're going to be

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.080 
them then shoot them we're going to be
using<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.530> zucca<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.010> Elliot<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> we're

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
using the zucca for Elliot and we're

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.319 
using the zucca for Elliot and we're
going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.329> using<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.550> launcher<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.910> dog

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
going to be using the launcher for dog

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
going to be using the launcher for dog
someone<00:00:45.930> he's<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.559> appropriate<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
someone he's out on appropriate so I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
someone he's out on appropriate so I
believe<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.570> both<00:00:48.780> deal<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.500> much

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
believe they both deal like pretty much

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.690 
believe they both deal like pretty much
the<00:00:49.710> same<00:00:49.860> amount<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> damage<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.579> you're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the same amount of damage but you're

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.350 
the same amount of damage but you're
going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.149> both<00:00:51.420> um<00:00:53.210> other<00:00:54.210> than

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
going to want to have both um other than

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
going to want to have both um other than
that<00:00:54.660> they're<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.340> bosses<00:00:56.520> there

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that they're like all the bosses there

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660 
that they're like all the bosses there
really<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> no<00:00:57.660> strategy<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.770> honest<00:00:59.129> other

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
really is no strategy to be honest other

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
really is no strategy to be honest other
than<00:00:59.910> dodging<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.570> fire<00:01:01.250> somehow<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:03.030> can

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
than dodging is fire somehow you can

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.450 
than dodging is fire somehow you can
shoot<00:01:03.510> him<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> face<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.710> don't<00:01:05.280> really

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
shoot him in the face but I don't really

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.340 
shoot him in the face but I don't really
know<00:01:05.700> how<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.000> time<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> well<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.960> it's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
know how to time it well I think it's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
know how to time it well I think it's
just<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.950> based<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:08.729> you're

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just kind of based on where you're

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.649 
just kind of based on where you're
standing<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.540> position<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:11.659> basically

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
standing in your position but basically

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.700 
standing in your position but basically
what<00:01:12.810> you're<00:01:12.930> doing<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.380> running

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
what you're doing is just running

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
what you're doing is just running
shooting<00:01:14.430> running<00:01:14.939> shooting<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> need

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
shooting running shooting so if you need

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
shooting running shooting so if you need
to<00:01:16.470> reload<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> reload<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to reload it's a good time to reload and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.060 
to reload it's a good time to reload and
then<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.840> shoot<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.950> will

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
then just don't shoot because you will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.210 
then just don't shoot because you will
be<00:01:20.189> hit<00:01:20.369> by<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> buyer<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> even<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.380> don't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
be hit by a buyer and even if you don't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
be hit by a buyer and even if you don't
shoot<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.700> still<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> bias<00:01:24.270> fire<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
shoot you can still be a bias fire so

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
shoot you can still be a bias fire so
yeah<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> why<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> want

is<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.169> working<00:03:49.349> out<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.849> know

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:50.969 
is just not working out is it you know

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.189 
is just not working out is it you know
what<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> don't<00:03:51.299> want<00:03:51.419> him<00:03:51.510> Stan<00:03:51.689> he<00:03:51.840> will<00:03:52.019> stand

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
what I don't want him Stan he will stand

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.750 
what I don't want him Stan he will stand
in<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.409> middle<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.739> fire<00:03:53.010> at<00:03:53.129> you<00:03:53.219> too<00:03:53.400> so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
in the middle of the fire at you too so

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.300 
in the middle of the fire at you too so
I<00:03:54.560> don't<00:03:55.560> want<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.949> happen

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
I don't want that to happen

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.589 
I don't want that to happen
let's<00:03:58.310> go<00:03:58.430> ahead<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.700> eat<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.819> hamburger<00:03:59.150> here

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
let's go ahead and eat a hamburger here

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.380 
let's go ahead and eat a hamburger here
we<00:03:59.810> only<00:03:59.930> have<00:04:00.080> one<00:04:00.230> sandwich<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.680> think<00:04:00.920> and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
we only have one sandwich I think and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.089 
we only have one sandwich I think and
those<00:04:02.390> heal<00:04:02.720> pretty<00:04:03.080> nice<00:04:03.290> too<00:04:03.500> uh<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.650> uh<00:04:06.709> oh

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
those heal pretty nice too uh but uh oh

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.589 
those heal pretty nice too uh but uh oh
come<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:07.849> yeah<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:09.650> uh<00:04:09.680> yeah<00:04:10.280> we're<00:04:11.180> almost<00:04:11.360> in

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
come on yeah but uh yeah we're almost in

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.600 
come on yeah but uh yeah we're almost in
his<00:04:11.690> second<00:04:12.110> phase<00:04:12.440> he<00:04:12.800> does<00:04:12.920> have<00:04:13.069> two<00:04:13.250> phases

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
his second phase he does have two phases

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.920 
his second phase he does have two phases
so<00:04:14.510> uh<00:04:14.540> why<00:04:15.440> am<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.650> not<00:04:15.680> running<00:04:16.720> should<00:04:17.720> really

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
so uh why am I not running should really

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.550 
so uh why am I not running should really
be<00:04:18.049> running<00:04:18.290> come<00:04:18.859> on<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.340> got<00:04:19.910> Dan<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:21.410> really

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
be running come on I got Dan it's really

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.879 
be running come on I got Dan it's really
frustrating<00:04:21.919> when<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.520> can't<00:04:22.730> run<00:04:22.910> away

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
frustrating when you just can't run away

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.930 
frustrating when you just can't run away
so<00:04:24.889> come<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:26.139> start<00:04:27.139> up<00:04:27.200> his<00:04:27.440> next<00:04:27.830> phase<00:04:28.310> one

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
so come on start up his next phase one

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.480 
so come on start up his next phase one
more<00:04:29.150> shot<00:04:29.419> should<00:04:29.900> do<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:31.120> i'm<00:04:32.120> hoping<00:04:32.570> so

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
more shot should do it i'm hoping so

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.800 
more shot should do it i'm hoping so
let's<00:04:34.490> get<00:04:34.639> away<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.940> seems<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.360> be<00:04:35.450> easier<00:04:35.720> to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
let's get away it seems to be easier to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.140 
let's get away it seems to be easier to
dodge<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.050> when<00:04:36.410> he<00:04:36.500> blows<00:04:36.710> fire<00:04:37.010> over<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.729> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
dodge it when he blows fire over in the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.010 
dodge it when he blows fire over in the
in<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.760> left<00:04:40.760> side<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.450> maybe<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.840> we<00:04:41.990> just

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
in the left side so maybe if we just

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.900 
in the left side so maybe if we just
keep<00:04:42.680> them<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:42.979> left<00:04:43.160> side<00:04:43.340> blowing<00:04:43.700> fire

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
keep them on the left side blowing fire

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.570 
keep them on the left side blowing fire
then<00:04:44.240> it<00:04:44.300> would<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.419> better<00:04:44.660> off<00:04:44.750> than

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
then it would be better off than

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.420 
then it would be better off than
alternating<00:04:46.580> sides<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:48.290> i<00:04:48.740> suppose<00:04:49.100> that's<00:04:49.340> a

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
alternating sides so i suppose that's a

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.480 
alternating sides so i suppose that's a
strategy<00:04:49.639> if<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.210> want<00:04:50.389> to<00:04:50.510> go<00:04:51.139> with<00:04:51.260> that

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
strategy if you want to go with that

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.080 
strategy if you want to go with that
there<00:04:53.240> we<00:04:53.330> go<00:04:53.419> second<00:04:53.990> phase<00:04:54.110> initiates<00:04:55.090> you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
there we go second phase initiates you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.430 
there we go second phase initiates you
would<00:04:56.210> have<00:04:56.300> stumped<00:04:56.720> through<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.110> ground

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
would have stumped through the ground

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.080 
would have stumped through the ground
like<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.710> big<00:04:58.069> monster<00:04:58.310> he<00:04:58.669> is<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.860> now<00:05:00.860> I

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
like a big monster he is and now I

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.219 
like a big monster he is and now I
suppose<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.419> a<00:05:02.509> little<00:05:02.750> bit<00:05:02.870> harder<00:05:03.169> because

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
suppose it's a little bit harder because

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.980 
suppose it's a little bit harder because
he's<00:05:03.470> closer<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:04.069> you<00:05:04.389> but<00:05:05.389> I'm<00:05:05.569> not<00:05:05.599> really

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
he's closer to you but I'm not really

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.240 
he's closer to you but I'm not really
sure<00:05:06.110> i<00:05:06.319> don't<00:05:06.560> know<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:06.830> basically<00:05:07.130> the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
sure i don't know it's basically the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.029 
sure i don't know it's basically the
same<00:05:07.490> strategy<00:05:08.319> except<00:05:09.319> now<00:05:09.470> i<00:05:09.500> think<00:05:09.919> it

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
same strategy except now i think it

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.409 
same strategy except now i think it
might<00:05:10.250> be<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.400> little<00:05:10.520> easier<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.819> pop<00:05:11.210> up<00:05:11.240> a

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
might be a little easier to pop up a

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.460 
might be a little easier to pop up a
head<00:05:11.569> shot<00:05:11.810> because<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.560> how<00:05:13.220> close<00:05:13.520> he<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:14.470> so

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
head shot because of how close he is so

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.469 
head shot because of how close he is so
you<00:05:15.979> know<00:05:16.039> i'm<00:05:16.490> sure<00:05:16.819> if<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.060> went<00:05:17.210> up<00:05:17.270> close

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
you know i'm sure if you went up close

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.240 
you know i'm sure if you went up close
enough<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.840> any<00:05:17.960> claw<00:05:18.349> you<00:05:18.590> were<00:05:18.710> something<00:05:18.979> so

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
enough to any claw you were something so

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.400 
enough to any claw you were something so
is<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:20.360> know<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:20.750> want<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:20.990> stay<00:05:21.199> away<00:05:21.380> from

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
is you know you want to stay away from

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.080 
is you know you want to stay away from
them<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.800> suppose<00:05:21.949> so<00:05:22.910> yeah<00:05:24.729> but<00:05:25.729> here<00:05:25.940> we<00:05:26.060> are

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
them I suppose so yeah but here we are

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.200 
them I suppose so yeah but here we are
at<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.419> end<00:05:26.449> of<00:05:26.599> the<00:05:26.690> game<00:05:26.720> wow<00:05:27.500> this<00:05:28.250> didn't

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
at the end of the game wow this didn't

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.629 
at the end of the game wow this didn't
actually<00:05:29.330> take<00:05:29.840> that<00:05:30.080> long<00:05:30.620> I<00:05:31.009> thought<00:05:31.400> this

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
actually take that long I thought this

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.129 
actually take that long I thought this
game<00:05:31.849> be<00:05:32.720> about<00:05:32.960> at<00:05:33.199> least<00:05:33.800> 30<00:05:34.220> parts<00:05:35.139> it's

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
game be about at least 30 parts it's

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.540 
game be about at least 30 parts it's
actually<00:05:36.289> not
