00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.139
 what are your thoughts on this 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.760
 match is fought against panama not by 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.160
 the truth first of all very happy 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.110
 and congratulate the whole group on the team 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.540
 those who supported our family the 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.000
 hobby that came but the truth is something 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.680
 very nice was the first very complicated 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.110
 and we always fight until the 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.730
 final he became a great family and now 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.500
 you have to enjoy the championship 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.690
 I was expecting such a difficult game here in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.890
 the final yes yes we already had it in mind 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.260
 it was going to be a very complicated match 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.550
 but I think we take it from the best 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.469
 way and thank God we were given the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.480
 triumph in the end already took the penal 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.969
 with a tranquility they had practiced 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.340
 that they had experience in mx league or 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.660
 how was that question so that it would be 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.760
 so easy 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.920
 the mayor of periana I think that the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 penalties is always something definitive and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.300
 we always practice the penal 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.030
 and it was reflected in right now in the game and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.320
 in the training always at the end 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.909
 we stay and thanks now 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.530

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.770
