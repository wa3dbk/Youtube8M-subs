00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.769
 sitting here counted in the resistance of the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 inflation controls the speed and if I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 I know this other kim of the thermostat that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.210
 go there 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 the piece here is a company at the carrier 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:33.360
 I know that here is the one here is the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 engine of the zaqueu box without the others 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 now I can show 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.980
 but I'm not sure what the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 which one should be the rationality 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:57.230
 power input 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:57.230
 probably this door 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.379
 I can not stay like that either. 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.379
 whip 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.720
 but even if you want it here I took it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.150
 here is going to start the engine since the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.440
 Speed resistance 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.440
 This is a whip. 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.630
 let's see if what I think is more 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 simple is the same thing this one goes 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.140
 start the engine 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.490
 here more connected in the resistance of the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.770
 Speed left this and whether these 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.370
 two here I can not say for sure where 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 and there's another one that already came with 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 the lamps that are probably 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.920
 lighting the panel by putting some 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.920
 simple thing
