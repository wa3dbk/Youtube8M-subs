00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
trans is a sort of transparency look

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.559 
trans is a sort of transparency look
like<00:04:00.180> ordinary<00:04:00.870> markers<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.420> the

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
like ordinary markers so this is the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.830 
like ordinary markers so this is the
part<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:05.120> Biederman's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.210 

whereas<00:04:09.840> for<00:04:10.260> shooting<00:04:12.620> range<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.790> in

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
whereas for shooting range and it's in

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.530 
whereas for shooting range and it's in
the<00:04:18.560> vocalist<00:04:19.560> I'm<00:04:20.070> gonna<00:04:20.489> demonstrate<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
the vocalist I'm gonna demonstrate it to

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.219 
the vocalist I'm gonna demonstrate it to
you<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.440> show<00:04:22.680> which<00:04:23.180> bitumen<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.660> moves

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.409 

consider<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.470> most<00:04:28.949> if<00:04:29.850> shot<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:31.020> shock<00:04:32.419> I'm

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
consider this most if shot in shock I'm

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:47.090 
consider this most if shot in shock I'm
gonna<00:04:33.690> use<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.020> bottle

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.100 

Alfred<00:04:48.100> here<00:04:48.430> Center<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.509> there<00:04:49.720> were<00:04:49.810> two

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
Alfred here Center and there were two

00:04:50.110 --> 00:05:00.719 
Alfred here Center and there were two
bottles<00:04:50.560> empty<00:04:50.919> bottles<00:04:58.919> now<00:04:59.919> it's<00:05:00.130> not<00:05:00.430> that

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
bottles empty bottles now it's not that

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.510 
bottles empty bottles now it's not that
strong

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
strong

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:22.250 
strong
whereas<00:05:03.520> if<00:05:03.669> I'm<00:05:03.850> using<00:05:04.090> my<00:05:05.160> bicep<00:05:18.990> they're

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:41.270 

basically<00:05:23.520> bison<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.669> mass<00:05:25.620> powerful<00:05:26.620> them

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.700 

so<00:05:42.280> this<00:05:42.520> from<00:05:43.419> what<00:05:43.720> you<00:05:44.080> see<00:05:45.539> this<00:05:46.539> bison<00:05:47.229> as

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
so this from what you see this bison as

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.100 
so this from what you see this bison as
the<00:05:48.250> better<00:05:49.949> force<00:05:51.330> compared<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.599> our<00:05:52.750> Chi

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
the better force compared to our Chi

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.930 
the better force compared to our Chi
because<00:05:53.380> our<00:05:53.710> Ricci<00:05:54.419> basically<00:05:55.419> we<00:05:55.750> have<00:05:55.990> a

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
because our Ricci basically we have a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:11.020 
because our Ricci basically we have a
smaller<00:05:57.940> model<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.800> shooting<00:06:00.150> impact<00:06:01.150> is

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.119 

obviously<00:06:12.169> it<00:06:13.169> doesn't<00:06:13.289> have<00:06:13.560> enough<00:06:13.830> force

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
obviously it doesn't have enough force

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:19.909 
obviously it doesn't have enough force
to<00:06:14.520> heat<00:06:15.210> down<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:18.750> worst<00:06:19.050> thing<00:06:19.680> is<00:06:19.889> that

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
to heat down and the worst thing is that

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.480 
to heat down and the worst thing is that
when<00:06:20.669> you<00:06:20.789> buy<00:06:23.449> make<00:06:24.449> sure<00:06:24.629> you<00:06:24.720> get<00:06:25.069> the<00:06:26.069> model

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
when you buy make sure you get the model

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:41.240 
when you buy make sure you get the model
just<00:06:35.720> so<00:06:37.039> even<00:06:38.039> if<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.280> get<00:06:38.520> a<00:06:38.960> part<00:06:39.960> of<00:06:40.250> padam

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
just so even if you get a part of padam

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.790 
just so even if you get a part of padam
on<00:06:41.430> tend<00:06:42.389> to<00:06:42.630> get<00:06:42.750> this<00:06:42.900> kind<00:06:43.110> of<00:06:43.139> model<00:06:43.500> it's

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
on tend to get this kind of model it's

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.360 
on tend to get this kind of model it's
not<00:06:44.490> that<00:06:44.669> good<00:06:45.409> but<00:06:46.409> to<00:06:46.800> get<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.159> original

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
not that good but to get the original

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.820 
not that good but to get the original
which<00:06:47.789> is<00:06:47.819> to<00:06:48.120> be<00:06:48.479> done<00:06:48.630> smile<00:06:49.139> just<00:06:49.500> bill

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
which is to be done smile just bill

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:58.939 
which is to be done smile just bill
color<00:06:50.750> which<00:06:51.750> is<00:06:51.990> a<00:06:52.020> better<00:06:52.409> post<00:06:57.229> so<00:06:58.229> in

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
color which is a better post so in

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.459 
color which is a better post so in
talking<00:06:59.250> about<00:06:59.759> this<00:07:00.030> to<00:07:02.150> difference<00:07:03.469> between

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:04.469 
talking about this to difference between

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:07.010 
talking about this to difference between
the<00:07:04.650> original<00:07:04.800> one<00:07:05.310> which<00:07:06.000> is<00:07:06.120> the<00:07:06.300> best<00:07:06.539> bison

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
the original one which is the best bison

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.860 
the original one which is the best bison
and<00:07:07.199> the<00:07:08.069> part<00:07:08.370> one<00:07:08.759> which<00:07:09.120> is<00:07:10.190> still<00:07:11.190> original

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.709 

later<00:07:15.870> part<00:07:16.259> I'll<00:07:16.620> be<00:07:16.919> shown<00:07:17.190> a<00:07:17.370> six-cd<00:07:18.120> 23

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 
later part I'll be shown a six-cd 23

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:24.350 
later part I'll be shown a six-cd 23
which<00:07:19.650> is<00:07:21.289> easier<00:07:22.289> which<00:07:23.069> is<00:07:23.250> regardless<00:07:24.150> on

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
which is easier which is regardless on

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.480 
which is easier which is regardless on
the<00:07:24.599> shooting<00:07:25.020> and<00:07:25.319> its<00:07:26.810> rifle<00:07:27.810> magazines

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
the shooting and its rifle magazines

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.730 
the shooting and its rifle magazines
which<00:07:29.509> which<00:07:31.340> is<00:07:32.960> thank<00:07:33.960> you<00:07:34.020> for<00:07:34.319> watching
