00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.190
 alchemy here we need elevated 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.409
 recovery skill open doing 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 potion let's say I have abyssinian perch 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.600
 and the little pearl we can see 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.820
 potion enhance science recovery 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 fourteen percent over 60 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.439
 seconds click create we get 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.909
 Actually we leave the menu 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.600
 alchemy discover items remove all 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.150
 what do we have on alchemy all 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 necessarily all so amulet olesja 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.759
 I can throw out so he lies here 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.240
 and then we open the potion and look for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.409
 this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.040
 this potion here she found it I drink it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 and immediately put on all our clothes again 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.610
 on alchemy and how by the way we can already 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.210
 notice the potion you created at 60 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.310
 percent power place 25 floor agent so 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.509
 opened again 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.149
 sku laboratory we are looking for again 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.320
 recovery and again abyssinian perch 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.630
 pearl already 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.980
 spell restore or 47 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.830
 percent within 60 seconds 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.019
 create and so can say up 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.519
 infinity but the maximum i did here 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:25.370
 such a potion here it is for no 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:30.760
 but the recovery spell is stronger 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.810
 our 168 thousand 513 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 percent for 60 seconds and beyond 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:44.720
 have a drink I'm sorry started over it all 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.170
 take off and continue to drink our potion again 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.010
 dress up and now when we enter the menu 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.010
 alchemy we can do well let's say 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.440
 increased enchantment skill 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.720
 improving the skill enchantment in 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.329
 for 30 seconds enchanted items 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.150
 29 thousand percent more powerful here we are 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.890
 we can do a lot and how you 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.700
 can see further we can do 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.700
 let's say 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:27.380
 let's say blacksmithing throw off and here in 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.770
 for 30 seconds weapon armor can 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.770
 improve by 118 thousand percent more 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.730
 so now I will quickly move to 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.860
 place where there is everything necessary for 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.970
 order to make armor 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.430
 so we can basically lend on 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.870
 just in case I will keep on done 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:02.560
 quickly save by pressing f5 and 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:07.239
 somewhere machines here objects potion potion 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.700
 rises where we have blacksmithing here 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.830
 this one sat we did for 118 thousand 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.430
 here let's say we kill him and quickly 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.180
 sit down sharpened 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.580
 one let's say if we want to sharpen 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.490
 Daedric two-handed sword look like 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.660
 he will have damage 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:38.289
 see his cost went up so 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:38.289
 make it so called nafig naturally 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.300
 stop baby you want to say there is no cruel 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.310
 Okay, I'll show of course I also wanted 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.320
 show by example by example 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.450
 daedric abuse if u improve on 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.020
 workbench be the same thing in a lot 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.730
 times will rise and the level of armor so 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.730
 let's see the weapon 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:17.100
 damage salt thousand five hundred and forty-three 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:24.000
 Wonderful tussen strike let's try 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:27.390
 on see one punch one punch my 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.160
 fighting girlfriend, too, the sword is grinding she 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.160
 will also be imposed on impact 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.209
 You see all the signal before 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.840
 not 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.020
 news 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.020

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.990
 I think I showed you this wonderful 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.000
 tank but advise too not 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.620
 overdo it if you do 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.080
 too let's say that's how I am a powerful weapon 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.950
 will kill the dragon with one blow then 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.780
 the game will of course be interesting but so 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.490
