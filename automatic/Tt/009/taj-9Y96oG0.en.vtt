I actually ended up going to all the

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
Home Depot's in the Bay Area to look for

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.590 
Home Depot's in the Bay Area to look for
these<00:00:17.080> cap<00:00:17.350> lights<00:00:17.590> and<00:00:18.150> pretty<00:00:19.150> much<00:00:19.240> clear

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
these cap lights and pretty much clear

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.290 
these cap lights and pretty much clear
out<00:00:19.869> all<00:00:20.199> all<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.250> stock<00:00:21.520> that<00:00:21.670> they<00:00:21.850> had

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
out all all the stock that they had

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.550 
out all all the stock that they had
so<00:00:22.570> I<00:00:22.599> created<00:00:23.109> a<00:00:23.199> little<00:00:23.320> bit<00:00:23.500> of<00:00:23.589> a<00:00:23.679> shortage

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980 

my<00:00:29.560> name<00:00:29.710> is<00:00:29.890> Corrine<00:00:30.310> Pawnee<00:00:30.609> Japan<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.179> I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
my name is Corrine Pawnee Japan and I

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.750 
my name is Corrine Pawnee Japan and I
have<00:00:32.560> this<00:00:32.770> guy<00:00:33.040> back<00:00:33.280> here

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
have this guy back here

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.470 
have this guy back here
called<00:00:33.940> tap<00:00:34.240> cap<00:00:34.450> animation<00:00:35.970> so<00:00:36.970> if<00:00:37.270> you

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
called tap cap animation so if you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.800 
called tap cap animation so if you
imagine<00:00:37.600> each<00:00:38.079> h<00:00:38.620> tap<00:00:39.010> light<00:00:39.220> as<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.460> pixel<00:00:39.850> you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
imagine each h tap light as a pixel you

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.960 
imagine each h tap light as a pixel you
can<00:00:41.020> kind<00:00:41.590> of<00:00:41.620> actuate<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.220> turn<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.670> on<00:00:42.790> and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
can kind of actuate it turn it on and

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.790 
can kind of actuate it turn it on and
off<00:00:43.060> and<00:00:43.420> start<00:00:43.720> creating<00:00:43.990> patterns<00:00:44.350> or

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
off and start creating patterns or

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.800 
off and start creating patterns or
messages<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.360> each<00:00:48.150> frame<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.450> going<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.720> be

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
messages and each frame is going to be

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.990 
messages and each frame is going to be
captured<00:00:50.260> by<00:00:50.410> little<00:00:50.710> device<00:00:51.010> here<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.550> you

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
captured by little device here and you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.530 
captured by little device here and you
can<00:00:52.150> start<00:00:52.390> creating<00:00:52.690> animations<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:54.540> you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
can start creating animations and you

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.080 
can start creating animations and you
see<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.080> know<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.410> mean<00:00:57.130> I<00:00:57.280> I'm<00:00:57.490> fascinated<00:00:57.820> by

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
see you know I mean I I'm fascinated by

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.530 
see you know I mean I I'm fascinated by
what<00:00:58.210> people<00:00:58.930> create<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:01.450> know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
what people create and you know

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.840 
what people create and you know
hopefully<00:01:01.810> I'll<00:01:02.320> see<00:01:02.530> what<00:01:02.830> what<00:01:03.580> people

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
hopefully I'll see what what people

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
hopefully I'll see what what people
create<00:01:04.119> today<00:01:04.390> at<00:01:04.600> Maker<00:01:04.839> Faire

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.779 

I<00:01:15.009> just<00:01:16.009> kind<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.399> really<00:01:17.240> like<00:01:17.539> seeing

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
I just kind of really like seeing

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.270 
I just kind of really like seeing
repeating<00:01:19.789> patterns<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.509> just<00:01:21.280> started

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
repeating patterns and I just started

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.539 
repeating patterns and I just started
experimenting<00:01:23.060> with<00:01:23.450> lines<00:01:24.109> and<00:01:24.710> shapes<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
experimenting with lines and shapes and

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.480 
experimenting with lines and shapes and
things<00:01:25.789> like<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:25.969> it<00:01:26.240> eventually<00:01:27.490> creating

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
things like that it eventually creating

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.219 
things like that it eventually creating
something<00:01:28.729> that's<00:01:30.310> very<00:01:31.599> basic<00:01:32.599> like<00:01:32.840> like

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
something that's very basic like like

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.559 
something that's very basic like like
these<00:01:33.590> pixel<00:01:34.280> patterns<00:01:34.819> right<00:01:35.090> here<00:01:35.359> it's

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
these pixel patterns right here it's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.880 
these pixel patterns right here it's
just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.399 

you<00:01:38.370> know<00:01:38.460> fun<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:38.909> bold<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.050> sort<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you know fun and bold this is sort of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.790 
you know fun and bold this is sort of
like<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:44.100> crowd<00:01:44.729> source<00:01:45.409> pattern<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
like a little crowd source pattern so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.399 
like a little crowd source pattern so
when<00:01:47.369> people<00:01:47.670> come<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> tap<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.229> my

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
when people come in and and tap on my

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.310 
when people come in and and tap on my
lights<00:01:49.650> that's<00:01:49.950> sort<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:51.210> know

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
lights that's sort of like you know

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.219 
lights that's sort of like you know
co-creating<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.890> atoms<00:01:53.490> together<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
co-creating all these atoms together and

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.210 
co-creating all these atoms together and
create<00:01:55.229> something<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.650> never<00:01:55.950> been<00:01:56.160> done

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
create something that's never been done

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.040 
create something that's never been done
before

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
before

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.790 
before
just<00:01:58.130> really<00:01:59.130> cool<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.490> I<00:02:00.259> if<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.470> were<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
just really cool because I if I were to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.440 
just really cool because I if I were to
do<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.280> version<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
do one version of this it would be one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
do one version of this it would be one
thing<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.680> magic<00:02:05.009> happens<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.490> people

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
thing but the magic happens when people

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270 
thing but the magic happens when people
actually<00:02:06.540> come<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.259> tap<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.100> lights

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
actually come in and tap all the lights

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729 
actually come in and tap all the lights
and<00:02:08.539> make<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.720> these<00:02:09.840> cool<00:02:10.050> patterns<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and make all these cool patterns that

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.760 
and make all these cool patterns that
I've<00:02:10.890> never<00:02:11.130> imagined<00:02:11.580> before

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
I've never imagined before

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:23.290 
I've never imagined before
