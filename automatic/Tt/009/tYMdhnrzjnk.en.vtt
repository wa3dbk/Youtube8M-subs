00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
experience books as you can see I have a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.390 
experience books as you can see I have a
few<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.529> answer<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
few right here and the answer to that is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.439 
few right here and the answer to that is
simply<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:19.230> raise<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:19.619> might<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.609> about<00:00:21.090> I

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
simply to raise your might to about I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.290 
simply to raise your might to about I
think<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.350> around<00:00:22.769> twenty<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.760> twenty<00:00:24.269> one

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
think it's around twenty to twenty one

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.900 
think it's around twenty to twenty one
thousand<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.220> will<00:00:26.369> start<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> get

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
thousand and then you will start to get

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880 
thousand and then you will start to get
the<00:00:27.029> purple<00:00:27.300> books<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.619> sure

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the purple books I think I'm not sure

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
the purple books I think I'm not sure
maybe<00:00:29.130> we'll<00:00:29.490> start<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.420> blue<00:00:31.080> books

maybe we'll start to get your blue books
then<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
then but I think that it's when you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.209 
then but I think that it's when you
really<00:00:33.870> start<00:00:34.140> getting<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.530> proper<00:00:34.739> books<00:00:35.040> at

thing I see I can see you like an
princess<00:04:59.060> or<00:04:59.300> at<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.200> bottom<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.770> at<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.160> top

I<00:05:02.030> can<00:05:02.090> it

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
I can it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.680 
I can it
I<00:05:02.920> would<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.970> maybe<00:05:05.560> maybe<00:05:06.560> not<00:05:06.770> actually<00:05:07.310> I

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
I would so maybe maybe not actually I

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.230 
I would so maybe maybe not actually I
would<00:05:08.690> say<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.310> would<00:05:10.310> maybe<00:05:10.550> be<00:05:10.940> better

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
would say that you would maybe be better

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.050 
would say that you would maybe be better
if<00:05:11.420> you<00:05:11.510> move<00:05:11.720> them<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.170> sides<00:05:12.470> here

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
if you move them to the sides here

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.220 
if you move them to the sides here
because<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:14.210> they<00:05:14.360> spawn<00:05:14.660> down<00:05:14.900> here<00:05:15.110> they

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
because if they spawn down here they

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.170 
because if they spawn down here they
will<00:05:15.380> just<00:05:15.620> go<00:05:15.830> directly<00:05:15.890> for<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.670> and<00:05:16.910> if<00:05:17.000> they

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
will just go directly for it and if they

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.410 
will just go directly for it and if they
spawn<00:05:17.480> here<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.930> like<00:05:18.200> this<00:05:18.760> pawn<00:05:19.760> hand<00:05:20.030> your

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
spawn here and like this pawn hand your

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.540 
spawn here and like this pawn hand your
interests<00:05:20.900> or<00:05:21.110> down<00:05:21.320> here<00:05:21.560> openly<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.310> don't

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
interests or down here openly I don't

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.400 
interests or down here openly I don't
know<00:05:22.670> if<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:22.820> can<00:05:22.940> see<00:05:23.090> my<00:05:23.240> pawn<00:05:23.780> pointer<00:05:24.260> here

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
know if you can see my pawn pointer here

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.350 
know if you can see my pawn pointer here
but<00:05:24.590> then<00:05:25.340> they<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.700> go<00:05:25.820> round<00:05:26.090> all<00:05:26.330> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
but then they have to go round all the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.020 
but then they have to go round all the
way<00:05:26.480> here<00:05:26.720> then<00:05:27.260> into<00:05:27.710> your<00:05:27.950> base<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.640> if<00:05:28.820> they

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
way here then into your base and if they

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.660 
way here then into your base and if they
spawn<00:05:29.300> around<00:05:29.480> here<00:05:29.960> they<00:05:30.680> will<00:05:30.920> go<00:05:31.100> all<00:05:31.460> the

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
spawn around here they will go all the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.700 
spawn around here they will go all the
way<00:05:31.700> up<00:05:32.030> here<00:05:32.270> probably<00:05:32.450> first<00:05:33.020> or<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.380> mean
