00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.820
 but the dark breed 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 not tense 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.509
 a lot of the 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.929
 a behavior for the coastal strip north of Berlin 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.349
 how could it be different so that's why his partner in this 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.849
 business 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.759
 in Prettin, LinkedIn in the first end is inappropriately critical 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.620
 What I do not want to say, why see you again? 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.630
 in the same setting of these Hancock 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.630
 Years in which our lost roleplay was read and traded 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.510
 you thought 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.110
 Mainly Hannig has selected the lyrics to have laughed too 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 read the opposite of the here on criticism makes ours 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.810
 Nellessen is solved he can not make criticism knows is a super 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.270
 game 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.490
 who stand for the stinging attitude as trivial and have to 1 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.810
 this time it could even make you a little bit excited 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.180
 because you can, for example, for the country that is nice and is and in Europe 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.080
 on the slopes and above all only as an all-rounder but you could appear 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.610
 anyway, only a single companion outer skin play mix two goals 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.039

 Thomas Müller 79 VfL of some in the gameplay «You want now in the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.759
 Rolling underwater you drive nothing at all what happened to them that is 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.759
 a bit of opportunities for McLaren Stephan Haupt 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.110
 I can not judge that because I did not play the predecessor often 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.780
 from that I do not want to miss I think Erdmann it already has one 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.050
 Sense smooth Handelsblatt but if you now have this character because 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.759
 He feels you can tell him in the case 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.329
 who was brought storm there then I would like to know what 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.599
 With some people we are a bit like a brother 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.929
 ended up giving his love-hate love when you still 40 40 hours even 80 hours 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.240
 famous 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 something supplied by the exhibitor all but say at least says it is good 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.899
 because I believe that she is the only partita character and that for me 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.040
 is a flowered asshole I had that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.539
 they all should drink alcohol again 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.099
 In order to blur the turn of the century Funes social vein 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.550
 Bayern he does not want to have more to say in Alberts especially 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.569
 Kirk m bit lower that nice 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.489
 I think no. There are again very beautiful stories 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.209
 some very nice levels 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.229
 in Lindau, it's definitely worth it for trends " 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.419
 to promote his hands 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.579
 but not completely free of criticism 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.760
 Fans will lick their fingers properly after that 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.839
 after the zoff of interest 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.619
 According to read criminally could the people too long and too 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 Tedious by the spectators 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 ajax 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 Fantastic, but he also says that more than that
