00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.730
 ah 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.080
 Welcome to this video number 2 of the 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.820
 series of 6 steps to love as you 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.709
 You can give an account in the previous video 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.840
 we talked a little bit about what psychology 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.119
 male and female psychology and one 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.920
 of the key points so you can 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.470
 relate to others and have a 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.210
 very very very father relationship later what 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.849
 we take to the next level you already understand 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.320
 psychology you already realize what is it 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.089
 what's happening around you and how 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.100
 you take with others what is the 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.960
 next good point that I want to where 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.150
 I want to get what kind of man I want 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.280
 and how I get it already I teach you a 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.629
 technique that is to form triads so that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.329
 can you relate only to 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.530
 superstars and you have very very men 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.149
 successful around you 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.550
 wanting to relate to you and 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.079
 speaking well of you if you found this 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.629
 video because some friend you the real thing you 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.980
 I pass it is necessary that you register and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.809
 that you see the video of the previous series 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.340
 if you have not seen it because I know I'm going 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.929
 to teach now is a continuation of 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.519
 same so if you have not seen the video 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.840
 number 1 I recommend you look for it in 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.940
 somewhere this window has to have 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 a link so you can see it and see 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.570
 now the video number 2 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.270
 in this video 2 I'm going to talk about 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.680
 point 3 and from point 4 from to 6 for 2 of 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.430
 love to find a relationship of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 reverie in step number 3 we are going to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.710
 talk about you have already identified the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.119
 man you like and you know that 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.770
 man that you like that you have in the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.929
 look 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.570
 it catches you a lot of attention and maybe 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.920
 cross looks and maybe something happens to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.390
 the best even is already 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.450
 conversing at work that is very 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.819
 common but still do not have a way out 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.259
 they still do not have a date like you do 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.509
 so that that person you have in your 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.000
 mind or that you have in your sight you 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.500
 approach and invite you to go out or talk 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.690
 with you and invite you out 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.460
 on the blog or on the facebook page you 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.260
 you have to have fixed many times they arrive 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.000
 those comments of what it is that speaks 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.130
 with me a lot in the office or talk to 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.680
 michu with me a lot at school or 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 We talked a lot through chat but never 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.690
 invite anywhere because he does not invite you 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.630
 the number one mistake by which you do not 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.240
 invites is because there is no doubt that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.580
 solve 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.420
 There is nothing to solve because I would like 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.160
 going to a date with you if all the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.840
 questions that have all the doubts that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.700
 has through you the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.590
 responding with you in front 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.940
 Think about it somehow whenever 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.660
 you want to know something about yourself is we have to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.700
 be at work 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.830
 every time you want to know something about yourself you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.360
 about chatting you leave your work to a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 side and you start talking to him and everything 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.989
 is very father finished talking or 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.220
 finish having what you want from you what 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.290
 who needs you and leaves 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.420
 and the next day he returns and receives it and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.640
 he leaves the next day he returns and what 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.440
 receives and leaves 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.990
 because I would have to invite you out 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.780
 because he would want to stay longer 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.700
 with you if you have what you need not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.560
 it does not make sense if on the other hand 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 He is with you or comes close to wanting 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.819
 talk to you and say for example 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.100
 you sow the doubt so that he wants 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.230
 going out with you begins to practice a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.790
 little and you tell him or you already know that I have 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.830
 a lot of work to do I would like 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.420
 keep practicing with you because I want 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.190
 tell me about this and this and about 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.020
 another but in this moment I really have 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.090
 to finish this and maybe we can 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.860
 leave in the week or I would like me 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.170
 I will finish talking about this but I have 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 something else to do you retire and you 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.650
 you turn to what you're doing to 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.260
 start it's you who cuts the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.420
 conversation is he who stays with 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.489
 Want more to stay wanting to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.380
 more will want to invite you to continue 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.600
 that same conversation in a context 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.370
 different and that's when you're going to achieve 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.900
 going out with him is there when you can 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.519
 use all other techniques of 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.019
 attraction and all other strategies 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.110
 that you learn how to conquer a 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.310
 man but until then you do not have 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.500
 many tools if you're in the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.360
 work you do not have many tools if 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.739
 you are on facebook you have few 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.580
 tools are you in the chat by the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.310
 mobile 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.340
 you need a complete context then 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.220
 You sow doubt and you sow the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.410
 doubt and you leave and when you achieve that you arrive 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.880
 to an exit already at the exit and when 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.950
 you start to build more moment 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.770
 and this brings us to the next point 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.010
 point that is point number 4 once 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.440
 that you manage to go out with what you do or how 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.940
 you get to have a lot of contact with him to 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.370
 that nothing else has a good time with you 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.590
 but want a lot more with you and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.330
 I want to see you even talk about you 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.670
 with your friends and presume that you 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.460
 he knew is a level completely 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.930
 different to have a good time to presume that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.150
 you just met a new girl and that 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.560
 you want to go out with her again 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.540
 totally different 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.910
 to start one of what I 'm going to 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.010
 Talk is the most common mistakes 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.750
 forget about cafes forget about bars and 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.820
 forget about places where you are 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.040
 in front of him having conversations 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.620
 direct 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.930
 because they still do not know each other 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 they still have nothing in common yet 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.320
 they do not have a link that keeps them 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.810
 an interesting conversation during 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.460
 long periods of time very 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.830
 probably if you do this it's going to 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.510
 seem job interview is going to have 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.820
 uncomfortable silences and he is going to make you 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.850
 a question of family type or type 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.440
 of work or type of pets goes to 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.720
 have an awkward silence and you go to 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.330
 ask the same thing and the dynamic is not going to 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.970
 flow very well that is what you can 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.250
 do instead choose scenarios 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.300
 or choose contexts that are completely 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.580
 different and completely absurd in 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.550
 where you have the opportunity to move it to 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.170
 him with your emotions the advantage that 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.210
 you have as a woman is that you move a lot 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.190
 that your emotions are awake that 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.400
 you can touch it and have it change its 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.920
 level quickly take advantage of are a 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.470
 interesting place or a place that could 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.120
 move it could be best to go skating 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.580
 go ice skating if you go to 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.380
 skate on ice to start if one 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.090
 of the two does not know is better because 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.689
 encourage contact and because there will be 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.429
 much laughter 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.559
 because probably one of the two 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:53.959
 will fall and from that you have a 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.419
 pretext to talk about that laugh and 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.399
 move it emotionally 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.860
 if there is no conversation you have something else 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:03.049
 in the middle you can make it move the 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.849
 environment that things go very well and 

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:07.489
 in small spaces of time you 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.849
 comunicas let raise the doubt and you 

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:13.729
 You are going to raise the doubt and you leave 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.870
 you generate a lot of attention this disappears 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.360
 your anxiety completely 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.740
 another thing that happens is that when 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.780
 are you on this first date or in this 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.220
 second appointment you have anxiety because if 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.660
 the man you're looking for you like 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.000
 a lot and you did what we saw in the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.130
 past videos you have high expectations 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.110
 that things work then 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.960
 you probably have anxiety and you do not know 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.880
 what to say is happening to you because you're 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.700
 focusing your attention on what he 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.420
 think about you 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.040
 how do you change it, turn it around 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.570
 what am I thinking of him 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.550
 has what I'm looking for does not have what 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.470
 what I'm looking for is showing the 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.380
 things that I did on my list really 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.840
 it's worth it that I'm giving away my 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.520
 time towards him if you change the focus 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.010
 and instead of thinking you're thinking 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.410
 the one about me you think is 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.610
 introducing me to me too 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.920
 completely your focus your anxiety 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.790
 disappear your anxiety goes on a 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.410
 second 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.690
 at this time we have spoken this 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.220
 forget number 2 I told him how 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.960
 get him to approach you and you 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.240
 invite to leave class and the next 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.070
 point how to get out and handle the situation
