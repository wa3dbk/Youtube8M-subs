00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.150
 blue and good but it's very good in this 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.039
 occasion is I have an audition bald and 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.859
 is that images are filtered out of the possible 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.900
 playstation 4 slim the rumors about a 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.310
 new playstation 4 model come back 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.839
 is the order of the day after the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.789
 filtration of some images of the 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.679
 alleged console since the launch was 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.909
 first sony playstation has always 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.380
 released what is a review of 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.189
 hardware in their consoles to do the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.020
 top 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.150
 playstation 4 was going to be less and 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.590
 although it seems that even then it's too much 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.600
 soon for health that is a bending 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.220
 4 sling have already leaked what they are 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
 the images of what the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.970
 new model of sony and is that if they look 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.290
 the images that I put in the background do not 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.150
 have to know what the code name is 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.800
 with which they are working in addition 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.450
 they also show us how in the case of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 that are confirmed, we would be 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.900
 before what is a much more model 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.250
 small of which we know nowadays and 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
 is that it is logical not if it is that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.400
 we are talking about what is a 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.930
 slim version we can also observe 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.880
 which is a new reader location 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.350
 discs and not buttons much more 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.409
 visible that the current version of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.600
 playstation 4 before this filtering are 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.880
 denied or confirmed the veracity 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.560
 of them from according to the sources 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.359
 is expected to be presented in the next 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.280
 e3 or during what is gamescom 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.810
 but I would like to emphasize again that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 this is only a rumor but if 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.709
 it turns out to be true that they think the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.509
 new design of we want to comment that in 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.670
 the bottom part telling me that they 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.849
 it seems the design the truth to me 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.619
 It seemed very beautiful and very aesthetic and very 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.090
 modern the truth too but good 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.030
