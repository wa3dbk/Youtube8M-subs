00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.010
 Good evening everyone, nice to meet you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.379
 My name is my head 8101 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:20.680
 I usually post the station change song using vocaloid 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:25.390
 Negina is the first work I tried to compete in the fancy train series voluntarily, so the quality is guaranteed 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:29.280
 I do not do so , but I hope you will watch it to the end 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.280
 Now let's immediately depart 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.850
 Let's go by a stray train The 6th collection of Tobu Sky Tree Line 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 May 22, 2012 Including Tokyo Sky Tree and surrounding facilities 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.339
 Tokyo Sky Tree Town opens 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:08.170
 Speaking of Tokyo Sky Tree Town, cargo terminals used to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:15.340
 Transportation power improvement of Isesaki Line in 1990 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.840
 At the end of a raid to destroy the ground home for the quick turn made for the sky in just 13 years 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.689
 was born 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:27.759
 It was built on the site of about 37,000 square meters of horizontal Narihirabashi Station 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.159
 Is a commercial facility building the Lord we are Tobu Railway 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.280
 world 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:40.009
 Selling radio waves boasting one height 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:40.549
 It is estimated that the number of yearly visitors is about 290.0 million, and foreigners can go directly from Haneda. 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.229
 To 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.180
 It might be for sale, but it was separated from Yamanote Line 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.530
 The head is a bruise when I say it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:59.740
 Asakusa Station, which is the base for Uo Luggage Terminal, is also one station 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.860
 How much ability to draw customers at this facility, which was built halfway 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.830
 This is the question of the Lord for a long time 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.830
 Well that's okay now, though 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:22.530
 The final decision to build a new tower in Sumida-ku, Tokyo was made in March 2006. 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:28.270
 Local express is abolished, which, coincidentally to direct between Asakusa Isesaki 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:36.310
 The pleasures of the daytime also depend on the eastern conspiracy that wants to guide tourists by express 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.870
 Historic diamond reform and rapid downgrade to the north during each station stop at the Tobu Animal Park 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.260
 Same month 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:48.290
 It is no exaggeration to say from this side in the long run that it's the company that the head went crazy 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:54.829
 May be the type of skytree in the subsequent head 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:03:03.079
 Rule attachment is no longer a travel company rather than a railway company as is well known 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:07.099
 From April 2010, the 350 form 3rd organization began to be operated as Sky Tree Train 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.280
 Some people may have noticed something unusual 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:15.140
 Tobu users 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.140
 I may not want to see it anymore, but let me introduce the curse of the head here 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:31.340
 Eerie purple to not be devoted i-th would be that what 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 Ya Nante but they've named wonder what the call without saying a Getemono this 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:43.430
 The other two colors and Sunny Coral Orange are not as poisonous as Ya, though 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.849
 A disappointing coloring far from the incumbent who has been used to seeing for many years 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.500
 It seems to be the color of the sky tree light up 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.830
 Maybe there was no more decent color 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.610
 And do not forget February 2012 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:02.530
 The head is from March 17 diamond revision 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:07.810
 Route nickname from Asakusa Oshiage to Tobu Animal Park 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.520
 Assigned station numbering to Tobu Sky Tree Line 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:18.470
 Perfectly mounted Leela Bridge 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:25.850
 I made a shocking announcement that a special express stop at Sky Tree station in Kaikyo . 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:27.150
 Umitsuri nice house and Mu today Ugh this is the part, such as corresponding to the main subject of this 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:35.789
 The 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:40.830
 It should be the interpretation of another street from the very this one sentence if the person to a normal way of thinking is 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:47.139
 You should think this way If you are a roughly even without a railway fan 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:53.689
 That the express train stops at Tokyo Skytree Station is natural for the later moons 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:59.060
 I think it's a normal way of thinking that I'm going to stop 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:01.840
 Re p Lord also it was one who made such a concept examples 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.840
 Yes Yes 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:13.180
 However, it is better not to sweeten the eastern company 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.180
 Our forecast will be largely betrayed on the day of the diamond revision 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:29.990
 Ohirairabashi that was light about the media from the early morning of March 17 which has finally been met 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:32.139
 High speed Tobu Nikko which left Asakusa at 6:20 of Kaito Sky Tree Station Empire 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.439
 Aizutajima Yuki is 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.439
 Let's pass Tokyo Skytree Station brilliantly 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:48.820
 Yea Miss's overrun Uteshi 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:56.860
 Even in the route map, there is no quick word saying that Tokyo Sky Tree has a stop. 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:58.150
 What I can do anyway Anything that can be said is the rapid section Rapidly both Tokyo Sky Tree Station 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.360
 It does not stop at 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:05.180
 Limited express stops 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:12.979
 Opinion is divided in various places about this 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:19.380
 If you want to return from the sky tree to buy express ticket ploy express induction that if ride express 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:25.350
 Since the 6050 series for rapid snowing is battery, foreigners also gather skype 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:32.580
 Escapism called sleep with such vehicle in Lee involved in the company of Apartments 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:38.430
 If something stops in the snow sky tree, the time will be extended and the vehicle will not be enough. 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.370
 Also trough excuse to tight in the eyes and cancer also wide-area operations, including 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.330
 it's no use 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.250
 Set minutes 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:55.090
 Because the rapid itself is scheduled to disappear in the near future 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:07:00.320
 Snow admission to comprehensive vehicle Mfg 6050 system from the beginning of this year in any case are two organized Kanazawa Hakkei 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:03.860
 About 20 years from the appearance that there is a movement of large-scale remodeling no 3 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:09.440
 Recycling train made by gathering hunts 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:13.070
 The 6050 series may be at the crossroads of life soon 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:17.140
 It's all Skytree rash's life company 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.140
 It depends on Tobu Railway 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:33.520
 How was the end of the main story above ? 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:38.729
 How is undecided but also us and I am glad 2 does not come into play to make the future of the name train series 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.729
 It was a work, but thank you for watching
