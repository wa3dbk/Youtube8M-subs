problem

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.619 
problem
well<00:03:09.379> actually<00:03:09.940> there's<00:03:10.940> more<00:03:11.060> than<00:03:11.450> one

Hemisphere<00:03:54.280> now<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:56.269> first<00:03:56.569> problem<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:57.230> this

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
Hemisphere now the first problem is this

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.289 
Hemisphere now the first problem is this
there<00:03:58.639> simply<00:03:59.329> are<00:03:59.810> not<00:04:00.410> enough<00:04:00.949> resources<00:04:01.940> on

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
there simply are not enough resources on
