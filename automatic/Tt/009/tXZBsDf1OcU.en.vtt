00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in all directions and it doesn't seem

in all directions and it doesn't seem

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
particularly organized but in fact there

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.540 
particularly organized but in fact there
is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.210> method<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> madness<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
is a method to the madness and and this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
is a method to the madness and and this
has<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.910> been<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.149> much<00:00:54.539> planned<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:56.010> we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
has all been very much planned out if we

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
has all been very much planned out if we
as<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.329> through<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.050> prune<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
as we come through and we prune the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
as we come through and we prune the
vines<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.399> were<00:00:59.460> dormant<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
vines when they were dormant when the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.330 
vines when they were dormant when the
when<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> leaves<00:01:01.079> had<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.379> fallen<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:02.219> were

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
when the leaves had all fallen we were

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
when the leaves had all fallen we were
thinking<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.390> much<00:01:03.539> bigger<00:01:03.750> did<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
thinking about how much bigger did the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
thinking about how much bigger did the
vine<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.339> could<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.670> could<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.270> give

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
vine have and how could we could we give

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
vine have and how could we could we give
them<00:01:07.439> enough<00:01:07.770> fruiting<00:01:08.250> wood<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:09.210> order<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
them enough fruiting wood in order to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810 
them enough fruiting wood in order to
produce<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.869> decent<00:01:10.350> crop<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> much

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
produce a decent crop and not so much

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.300 
produce a decent crop and not so much
that<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.330> overtax<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> vine<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
that it would overtax the vine so that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
that it would overtax the vine so that
so<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:15.210> control<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> amount<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.229> fruiting

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so we can control the amount of fruiting

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.700 
so we can control the amount of fruiting
wood<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> Canes<00:01:17.700> bear<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.080> last

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
wood because the Canes bear the last

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
year's Cannes bear this year's Cannes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
year's Cannes bear this year's Cannes
and<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.590> year's<00:01:22.830> Cannes<00:01:23.130> each<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.880> two

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and this year's Cannes each have two

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
and this year's Cannes each have two
clusters<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.500> come<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
clusters on them so we can come out and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
clusters on them so we can come out and
we<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> thin<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.210> off<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.020> think

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
we can we can thin these off if we think

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
we can we can thin these off if we think
there's<00:01:28.439> too<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.740> fruit<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.549> them<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.570> can

there's too much fruit on them we can

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.749 
there's too much fruit on them we can
leave<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.140> canes<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> vine<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
leave more canes if we think the vine it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.640 
leave more canes if we think the vine it

balance<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> try<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.320> enough<00:01:49.619> leaves<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
balance to try to get enough leaves to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.249 
balance to try to get enough leaves to
for<00:01:50.520> photosynthesis<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> grapes

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
for photosynthesis to get the grapes

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.370 
for photosynthesis to get the grapes
ripe<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.850> leave<00:01:54.000> enough<00:01:54.479> fruit<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
ripe and and to leave enough fruit on it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.819 
ripe and and to leave enough fruit on it
so<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.310> getting<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.610> decent<00:01:56.790> crop<00:01:57.829> one

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so that we're getting a decent crop one

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
so that we're getting a decent crop one
of<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> questions<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.490> always<00:01:59.610> comes<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of the questions that always comes up in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.969 
of the questions that always comes up in
the<00:02:00.570> vineyard<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.380> crop<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.829> there

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the vineyard is how much crop is there

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.499 
the vineyard is how much crop is there
going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.729> everybody<00:02:03.149> always<00:02:03.210> wants

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
going to be and everybody always wants

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.980 
going to be and everybody always wants
to<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:04.340> why<00:02:05.340> why<00:02:05.969> there's<00:02:06.240> more<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.810> why

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
to know why why there's more or why

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.540 
to know why why there's more or why
there's<00:02:07.229> less<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.799> how<00:02:07.950> much<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.429> going

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
there's less or how much is there going

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.040 
there's less or how much is there going
to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> very<00:02:09.390> difficult<00:02:09.750> question

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
to be and it's a very difficult question

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.140 
to be and it's a very difficult question
for<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.770> growers<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> answer<00:02:11.610> because<00:02:11.790> there

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
for the growers to answer because there

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
for the growers to answer because there
are<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.300> many<00:02:12.540> factors<00:02:12.690> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
are so many factors that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.449 
are so many factors that
into<00:02:14.209> bearing<00:02:15.209> on<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.079> fruitfulness<00:02:16.709> for

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
into bearing on on the fruitfulness for

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.280 
into bearing on on the fruitfulness for
one<00:02:17.609> thing<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.239> fruitfulness<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.109> vine

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
one thing the fruitfulness of the vine

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.199 
one thing the fruitfulness of the vine
is<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.159> determined<00:02:20.730> when<00:02:20.879> this<00:02:21.000> little

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
is that is determined when this little

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.449 
is that is determined when this little
bud<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:22.079> produced<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.680> cane<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.219> year

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
bud that produced this cane this year

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.220 
bud that produced this cane this year
last<00:02:23.700> year<00:02:23.849> when<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.209> was<00:02:24.329> what<00:02:24.689> was<00:02:25.019> just

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
last year when it was what was just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
last year when it was what was just
developing<00:02:25.769> inside<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:27.120> cane<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:28.670> depending

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
developing inside this cane it depending

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.280 
developing inside this cane it depending
on what<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.030> weather<00:02:30.359> was<00:02:30.599> when<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.049> bud

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
on what the weather was when that bud

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.649 
on what the weather was when that bud
was<00:02:31.500> developing<00:02:32.040> determined<00:02:32.969> how<00:02:33.120> fruitful

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
was developing determined how fruitful

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.149 
was developing determined how fruitful
what<00:02:33.870> size<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.439> this<00:02:34.590> would<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.889> a<00:02:34.920> small

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
what size that this would be a small

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.530 
what size that this would be a small
cluster<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.030> would<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.329> little

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
cluster and that this would be a little

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.599 
cluster and that this would be a little
bit<00:02:36.900> larger<00:02:37.049> or<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.829> instance<00:02:38.129> on<00:02:38.219> this<00:02:38.370> shoot

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
bit larger or for instance on this shoot

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.030 
bit larger or for instance on this shoot
it<00:02:38.849> developed<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.049> bit<00:02:40.230> later<00:02:40.500> when

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it developed a little bit later when

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.589 
it developed a little bit later when
there<00:02:41.219> was<00:02:41.340> more<00:02:41.549> sunlight<00:02:41.849> shining<00:02:42.299> on<00:02:42.569> it

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
there was more sunlight shining on it

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.289 
there was more sunlight shining on it
and<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.250> clusters<00:02:44.639> are<00:02:44.790> much<00:02:45.000> larger

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
and so the the clusters are much larger

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.270 
and so the the clusters are much larger
than<00:02:45.599> they<00:02:45.930> were<00:02:45.989> on<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.500> bud<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.859> developed

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
than they were on the bud that developed

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.030 
than they were on the bud that developed
early<00:02:47.909> when<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.480> was<00:02:48.599> overcast<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.799> can

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
early when it was overcast so you can

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.039 
early when it was overcast so you can
see<00:02:50.189> that<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> weather<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.239> happens<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
see that the weather that happens at the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
see that the weather that happens at the
time<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.530> these<00:02:52.680> buds<00:02:53.010> were<00:02:53.280> developing

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
time that these buds were developing

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.879 
time that these buds were developing
last<00:02:54.060> year<00:02:54.299> has<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> profound<00:02:54.840> effect<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.620> what

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
last year has a profound effect on what

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.860 
last year has a profound effect on what
the<00:02:56.010> crop<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.939> this<00:02:57.180> year<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the crop is going to be this year but

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.110 
the crop is going to be this year but
it's<00:02:58.019> not<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.169> only<00:02:58.319> effect<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.669> in

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
it's not the only effect because in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.020 
it's not the only effect because in
addition<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.430> weather<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.969> is

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
addition to that we the weather that is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.729 
addition to that we the weather that is
taking<00:03:03.389> place<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.689> now<00:03:04.079> during<00:03:04.469> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
taking place right now during the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.099 
taking place right now during the
balloon<00:03:04.980> period<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.000> see<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.510> these<00:03:06.959> are

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
balloon period you see that these are

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.869 
balloon period you see that these are
all<00:03:07.319> these<00:03:07.680> flowers<00:03:07.919> are<00:03:08.400> right<00:03:08.639> in<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
all these flowers are right in the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.179 
all these flowers are right in the
middle<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.209> bloom<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.560> that

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
middle of bloom you can see this that

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.520 
middle of bloom you can see this that
some<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.549> statements<00:03:11.790> are<00:03:12.359> drying<00:03:13.019> up<00:03:13.230> and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
some of the statements are drying up and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.209 
some of the statements are drying up and
others<00:03:14.340> are<00:03:14.519> just<00:03:15.030> popping<00:03:15.269> out<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.439> but<00:03:17.010> in

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
others are just popping out but but in

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.390 
others are just popping out but but in
general<00:03:17.579> only<00:03:18.180> about<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.449> quarter<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.930> these

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
general only about a quarter of these

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.189 
general only about a quarter of these
flowers<00:03:20.400> will<00:03:21.090> actually<00:03:21.510> produce<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.989> great

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
flowers will actually produce a great

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.800 
flowers will actually produce a great
the<00:03:23.159> others<00:03:23.639> will<00:03:23.819> just<00:03:24.060> dry<00:03:24.239> up<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.540> fall<00:03:24.750> off

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the others will just dry up and fall off

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.469 
the others will just dry up and fall off
but<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.549> number<00:03:26.879> that<00:03:27.030> actually

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
but that the number that actually

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.149 
but that the number that actually
produce<00:03:27.659> grapes<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.169> quite<00:03:28.379> variable<00:03:28.799> from

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
produce grapes is quite variable from

year to year and it depends on what the
weather<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:30.989> we<00:03:31.709> had<00:03:31.889> some<00:03:32.129> very<00:03:32.250> hot<00:03:32.549> weather

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
weather is we had some very hot weather

weather is we had some very hot weather
last<00:03:33.120> week<00:03:33.479> if<00:03:33.720> these<00:03:34.260> had<00:03:34.290> been<00:03:34.470> flowering

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
last week if these had been flowering

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.710

when<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> weather<00:03:35.939> was<00:03:36.150> over<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.449> hundred

when the weather was over a hundred
degrees<00:03:36.870> we<00:03:37.530> could<00:03:37.739> pretty<00:03:37.919> much<00:03:38.040> guarantee

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
degrees we could pretty much guarantee

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.640 
degrees we could pretty much guarantee
that<00:03:38.729> there<00:03:39.030> would<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.180> almost<00:03:39.510> no<00:03:40.079> great

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
that there would be almost no great

berries on each of these clusters they

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.479 
berries on each of these clusters they
might<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.349> three<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:43.709> four<00:03:43.949> berries<00:03:44.310> on

might have just three or four berries on

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.699 
might have just three or four berries on
them<00:03:44.699> it's<00:03:45.180> very<00:03:45.419> very<00:03:45.750> bad<00:03:45.989> for<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> grape

cool<00:03:50.220> weather<00:03:50.489> during<00:03:50.790> bloom<00:03:51.150> would<00:03:51.629> have

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
cool weather during bloom would have

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.429 
cool weather during bloom would have

if<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.780> happens<00:04:01.439> then<00:04:01.919> we<00:04:02.129> have<00:04:02.280> very<00:04:02.549> uneven

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
if that happens then we have very uneven

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.330 
if that happens then we have very uneven
ripeness<00:04:03.599> within<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.439> cluster<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:04.949> may<00:04:05.129> have

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.219 
same cluster so so the weather this year
as<00:04:11.609> well<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> weather<00:04:12.239> last<00:04:12.629> year<00:04:12.870> have

as well as the weather last year have

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.530

profound effects as well as the soil and

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.810 
profound effects as well as the soil and
here<00:04:16.079> we<00:04:16.199> planted<00:04:16.859> our<00:04:16.949> cabernet<00:04:17.370> sauvignon

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
here we planted our cabernet sauvignon

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.120 
here we planted our cabernet sauvignon
in<00:04:18.060> our<00:04:18.180> weakest<00:04:18.659> soil<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.919> vine

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
in our weakest soil because it's a vine

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.099 
in our weakest soil because it's a vine
that's<00:04:20.400> very<00:04:20.579> vigorous<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.329> cane<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.840> grew

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
that's very vigorous this cane just grew

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.610 
that's very vigorous this cane just grew
in<00:04:22.289> about<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.830> month<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.330> 12<00:04:24.990> it's<00:04:25.200> it's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
in about a month and it's 12 it's it's

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.090 
in about a month and it's 12 it's it's
three<00:04:25.950> feet<00:04:26.159> long

we<00:04:27.280> don't<00:04:27.430> want<00:04:27.730> our<00:04:27.940> Cabernet<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.480> keep

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
we don't want our Cabernet to keep

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.510 
we don't want our Cabernet to keep
growing<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.440> producing<00:04:29.650> lots<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.310> leaves

growing and producing lots of leaves

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.100 
growing and producing lots of leaves
because<00:04:31.000> they'll<00:04:31.210> shade<00:04:31.420> out<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.750> fruit<00:04:31.960> and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
because they'll shade out the fruit and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.140 
because they'll shade out the fruit and
the<00:04:32.200> fruit<00:04:32.560> flavor<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.370> very<00:04:33.700> much<00:04:33.940> dependent

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the fruit flavor is very much dependent

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.680 
the fruit flavor is very much dependent
on<00:04:34.630> getting<00:04:34.930> good<00:04:35.530> sunlight<00:04:35.830> exposure<00:04:36.690> here

on getting good sunlight exposure here

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.260 
on getting good sunlight exposure here
we<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:37.960> actual<00:04:38.320> berries<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.040> week<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.150> if

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
we have actual berries and week and if

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.630 
we have actual berries and week and if
we<00:04:40.390> compare<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.650> some<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.130> see<00:04:42.400> some

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
we compare it to to some of you see some

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.330 
we compare it to to some of you see some
are<00:04:42.760> larger<00:04:43.390> than<00:04:43.420> others<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:44.650> they'll<00:04:44.830> all

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
are larger than others but they'll all

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.340 
are larger than others but they'll all
be<00:04:45.460> pretty<00:04:45.670> much<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.880> same<00:04:46.180> size<00:04:46.830> later<00:04:47.830> on

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
be pretty much the same size later on

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.480 
be pretty much the same size later on
but<00:04:50.350> if<00:04:50.470> we<00:04:50.560> compare<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.010> something<00:04:51.220> like

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
but if we compare it to something like

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.010 
but if we compare it to something like
this<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:52.060> is<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.270> flower<00:04:52.540> that's<00:04:52.690> just

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
this this is a flower that's just

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.540 
this this is a flower that's just
happening<00:04:53.350> now<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.890> see<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.160> potential

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
happening now you can see the potential

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.390 
happening now you can see the potential
for<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.360> number<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.780> berries<00:04:56.140> is<00:04:56.320> huge<00:04:56.710> but

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
for the number of berries is huge but

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.310 
for the number of berries is huge but
they<00:04:57.550> just<00:04:57.730> won't<00:04:58.240> end<00:04:58.480> up<00:04:58.660> being<00:04:58.930> there<00:04:59.170> in

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
they just won't end up being there in

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.620 
they just won't end up being there in
the<00:04:59.410> final<00:04:59.710> analysis<00:05:00.280> actually<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.450> looks

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
the final analysis actually it looks

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.850 
the final analysis actually it looks
like<00:05:01.780> we're<00:05:01.930> going<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.140> have<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.260> pretty<00:05:02.470> decent

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
like we're going to have a pretty decent

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.840 
like we're going to have a pretty decent
rasta<00:05:03.220> career<00:05:03.490> which<00:05:03.640> is<00:05:03.820> good<00:05:05.550> because<00:05:06.550> we've

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
rasta career which is good because we've

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.820 
rasta career which is good because we've
been<00:05:06.880> very<00:05:07.030> shy<00:05:07.480> and<00:05:07.750> Cheyenne<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.680> our

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
been very shy and Cheyenne on our

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.220 
been very shy and Cheyenne on our
Cabernet<00:05:09.250> for<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.550> last<00:05:09.730> two<00:05:09.940> years<00:05:10.170> but<00:05:11.170> I

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
Cabernet for the last two years but I

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.660 
Cabernet for the last two years but I
think<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.710> year<00:05:11.920> will<00:05:12.040> have<00:05:12.100> close<00:05:12.520> to

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
think that this year will have close to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.280 
think that this year will have close to

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
three times per acre which is a very

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.190 
three times per acre which is a very
comfortable<00:05:15.010> amount<00:05:15.720> certainly<00:05:16.720> not<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.930> high

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
comfortable amount certainly not a high

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.560 
comfortable amount certainly not a high
amount<00:05:17.440> by<00:05:17.650> most<00:05:17.830> people<00:05:18.160> standards<00:05:18.520> but<00:05:19.300> I

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
amount by most people standards but I

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.810 
amount by most people standards but I
think<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:19.870> will<00:05:20.110> get<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.410> kind<00:05:20.560> of

think it will get the kind of

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.700 
think it will get the kind of

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
concentration as well as that stuff ripe

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.230 
concentration as well as that stuff ripe
