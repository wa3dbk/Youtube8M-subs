00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
just with a more different type I don't

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.750 
just with a more different type I don't
know<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.200> different<00:04:24.380> type<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.650> surface<00:04:25.460> area<00:04:25.580> to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760

him<00:04:25.970> i<00:04:26.030> think<00:04:26.240> i<00:04:26.450> like<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.169> top<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> logs

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
weathering of them but i don't think you

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.890
