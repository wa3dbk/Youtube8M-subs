00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
syringe as this is what was available to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
syringe as this is what was available to
me<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> kind<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> work<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> best<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
me and kind of work the best to do this

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.130 
me and kind of work the best to do this
effect<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.820> I'll<00:00:33.300> start<00:00:33.540> by<00:00:33.600> mixing<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
effect so I'll start by mixing up the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
effect so I'll start by mixing up the
Vaseline<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.649> soften<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.399> bit

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
Vaseline to soften it a little bit

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
Vaseline to soften it a little bit
taking<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.780> taking<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
taking a little taking a little bit of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619 
taking a little taking a little bit of
time<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.910> into<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> syringe

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
time just to get up into the syringe

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110 
time just to get up into the syringe
I've<00:00:40.590> heard<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> ultra<00:00:41.370> ice<00:00:41.520> gel<00:00:41.879> works

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I've heard that ultra ice gel works

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.060 
I've heard that ultra ice gel works
really<00:00:42.510> well<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
really well for this but it is a bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.619 
really well for this but it is a bit
more<00:00:44.219> expensive<00:00:44.520> I'll<00:00:44.879> show<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.480> out

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
more expensive I'll show you right out

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180 
more expensive I'll show you right out
that<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> Vaseline<00:00:46.379> didn't<00:00:46.680> last<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that the Vaseline didn't last the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.010 
that the Vaseline didn't last the
longest<00:00:47.520> amount<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.910> time<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
longest amount of time for me so it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
longest amount of time for me so it
would<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.200> good<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> photo<00:00:49.890> series<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.550> for

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
would be good for a photo series or for

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
would be good for a photo series or for
a<00:00:50.760> take<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.360> film<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> probably

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a take or two one film it probably

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
a take or two one film it probably
wouldn't<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.590> through<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> con<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> big

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
wouldn't make it through a con or a big

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
wouldn't make it through a con or a big
party<00:00:53.910> ultra<00:00:54.270> ice<00:00:54.480> gel<00:00:54.840> might<00:00:55.110> work<00:00:55.260> better

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
party ultra ice gel might work better

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
party ultra ice gel might work better
for<00:00:55.739> longevity<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.460> those<00:00:56.610> circumstances<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
for longevity in those circumstances so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
for longevity in those circumstances so
next<00:00:57.899> I'll<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.170> using<00:00:58.350> some<00:00:58.649> cream<00:00:58.920> paint<00:00:59.190> by
