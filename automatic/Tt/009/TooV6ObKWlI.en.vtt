00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello today is wednesday time 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.230
 next review one ace to her 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 My name is Andrei Kalashnik today you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 hear Chinese stronghold next 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.990
 wave of 77 naturally stands for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 Dima amount on the screen but when i 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.279
 first time I took this tablet in my hands 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.029
 it seemed that he was six-inch 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 but let's talk about this a bit later 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 By the way , this same tablet can be met 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.810
 as pipa and barely or pipo ultra u2 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 let's talk about me first 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.809
 I liked it except for the size of this tablet 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.410
 7 inch ips matrix screen 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.239
 1024 by 600 pixels resolution is not the most 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219
 cool features for the screen 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 especially when compared with the same 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.980
 the most novelties from samsung 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.739
 the fact that it is a halim chinese screen is not 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 occurs at all while working with this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 tablet, I realized that the Chinese 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.570
 really know how to make tablets 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.809
 well as you can see it works on android 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.850
 4 1 with almost internal memory 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.650
 hector built another 13 for your 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.930
 music documents and files altogether 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.540
 I recently reviewed in Chinese 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 children's tablet therefore could not resist and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.590
 played a little bit including angry 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590
 birds 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.390
 that's in some unthinkable way my 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.150
 the bird kills two pigs and you can 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.920
 continue to review further sooner 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.610
 you have already noticed that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.780
 next wave f7 many pre-installed 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.510
 Chinese software wouldn't say that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.229
 it's hacking some of them like for example 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.120
 this one 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 I like ereader only 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.770
 need to figure out a little throw 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.810
 his book and then you can read here 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 in such an interesting way as if 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.150
 you leaf through your book on ipad because 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.880
 page turning animation went 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
 from apple 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.729
 now connectors first standard 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.300
 headphone jack 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.330
 already demeo and mini usb power button 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.239
 unlocking the screen by the way stump 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.810
 metal on it bear the name 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.090
 buttons 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.550
 lest we accidentally forget two 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 speaker side charging 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.330
 bottom slot for micro sd card and microphone 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.100
 now I personally have the size of nexus 7 but 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.070
 it seems almost half as much 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.900
 more due to the big move on 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.730
 picking as you saw x-37 box 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.630
 does not hold in itself 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.500
 wire well 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.680
 this is such a separate box with 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.250
 charging 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.250
 3 not adapters also in the box together 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.330
 so firstly this mini adapter 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.230
 usb usb to connect the mouse or 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.510
 keyboard 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.510
 which I do not really like, I do not like less 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.260
 drive now all phones micro yusbi 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:22.450
 connector including charging headset 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.300
 quite ordinary typical let's say 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 for Chinese tablets nothing especially 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.560
 By the way, the price for the next web does not stand out 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.180
 f7 you can look at the link in 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.540
 description for this video 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 then we have a charging cable 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.110
 original naturally and under 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.180
 I do not have the original view of the fact that he 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.710
 made in Chinese mix track plants 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.320
 the fact that it does not fit any other 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:53.970
 devices and goes mini usb cable for 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.970
 connect to computer 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.750
 that's all thank you for listening to my review 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.260
 subscribe and meet then in 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.260
