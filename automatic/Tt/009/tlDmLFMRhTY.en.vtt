00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.309 
so I'm back I finished my three six inch
eye<00:00:04.440> chords<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.430> left<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.150> yarn<00:00:06.359> attached<00:00:06.839> on

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
eye chords I left the yarn attached on

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.320 
eye chords I left the yarn attached on
this<00:00:07.680> left<00:00:08.160> one<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.460> was<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> last<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.269> I

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
this left one it was the last one that I

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.270 
this left one it was the last one that I
completed<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.349> didn't<00:00:10.620> cut<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.950> yarn<00:00:11.130> on

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
completed so I didn't cut the yarn on

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.839 
completed so I didn't cut the yarn on
this<00:00:11.429> one

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
this one

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.480 
this one
now<00:00:12.570> you<00:00:12.960> could<00:00:13.290> cut<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> yarn<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.340> one

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
now you could cut the yarn on this one

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
now you could cut the yarn on this one
and<00:00:14.639> not<00:00:14.759> worry<00:00:15.059> about<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.049> thought<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and not worry about it but I thought I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.029 
and not worry about it but I thought I
would<00:00:16.560> leave<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> attached<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.830> it<00:00:19.830> was

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
would leave it attached so that it was

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.880 
would leave it attached so that it was
just<00:00:20.220> one<00:00:20.250> last<00:00:20.640> end<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:22.140> weave<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> end

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
just one last end to weave in at the end

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130 
just one last end to weave in at the end
it's<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.150> deal<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.960> that's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
it's really not a big deal but so that's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
it's really not a big deal but so that's
up<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.220> what<00:00:26.400> I'm<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.820> then

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.939 
is braid these and I'm going to start
with<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> left<00:00:29.840> cord<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.199> I'm<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.740> do

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
with the left cord and I'm just gonna do

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.940 
with the left cord and I'm just gonna do
a<00:00:31.980> brain<00:00:35.630> so<00:00:37.190> I'm<00:00:38.190> shooting<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a brain so I'm shooting to have like a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
a brain so I'm shooting to have like a
three<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.600> eye

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
three like if you look at this one eye

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:53.979 
three like if you look at this one eye
one<00:00:43.079> two<00:00:43.770> three<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.360> now<00:00:45.510> I've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.050> two

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.439 

one<00:00:54.989> two<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.739> three<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.699> you're<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
one two and three so you're just kind of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.500 
one two and three so you're just kind of
have<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> rearrange<00:01:01.070> here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.480> here<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
have to rearrange here and here so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
have to rearrange here and here so
they're<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:05.610> lined<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.710> alright<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.950> I've<00:01:08.340> got

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're all lined up alright so I've got

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.020 
they're all lined up alright so I've got
my<00:01:08.640> three<00:01:10.850> braided<00:01:11.850> sections<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.890> kind<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
my three braided sections are kind of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.280 
my three braided sections are kind of
times<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.689> don't<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> call

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
times going in I don't know what to call

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.850 
times going in I don't know what to call
it<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.280> two<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> three<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.560> yarn

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it but one two and three now in my yarn

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
it but one two and three now in my yarn
is<00:01:20.189> still<00:01:20.460> attached<00:01:20.759> over<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
is still attached over here it's on the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.100 
is still attached over here it's on the
outside<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> flip<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> around

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
outside so I'm going to flip that around

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.520 
outside so I'm going to flip that around
and<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.400> start<00:01:26.640> working<00:01:27.530> I'm

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and so that I can start working I'm

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420 
and so that I can start working I'm
going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> place<00:01:30.259> these<00:01:31.259> stitches<00:01:31.680> back<00:01:32.100> onto

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
going to place these stitches back onto

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
going to place these stitches back onto
my<00:01:32.700> larger<00:01:33.150> size<00:01:33.600> needle<00:01:34.200> straight<00:01:34.710> from<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
my larger size needle straight from the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
my larger size needle straight from the
deep<00:01:36.060> Aeons

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 

see<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.010> they're<00:01:44.190> all<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.820> right<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.180> on

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
see how they're all going right back on

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.570 
see how they're all going right back on
there<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.620> will<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.920> some<00:01:47.130> ends<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
there now you will have some ends to

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.030 
there now you will have some ends to
weave<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.810> best<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> big

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
weave in but it's best not really a big

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.960 
weave in but it's best not really a big
deal<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.370> just<00:01:50.610> pull<00:01:50.760> them<00:01:50.940> right

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
deal you can just pull them right

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.900 
deal you can just pull them right
through<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.350> icord<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.100> snip<00:01:53.400> them<00:01:53.580> off<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
through the icord and snip them off so

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050 
through the icord and snip them off so
they<00:01:54.060> stay<00:01:54.270> inside<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.780> icord<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:56.160> there<00:01:56.940> we

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
they stay inside the icord and there we

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.570 
they stay inside the icord and there we
have<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
have it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.040 
have it
I'm<00:01:59.580> trying<00:01:59.940> to<00:01:59.970> remember<00:02:00.180> where<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.479> end<00:02:00.810> is

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
I'm trying to remember where my end is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.180 
I'm trying to remember where my end is
my<00:02:02.780> ends<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.900> my<00:02:04.020> working<00:02:04.410> yarns<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
my ends up my working yarns over here so

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.010 
my ends up my working yarns over here so
I'm<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> pull<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.869> other

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I'm going to pull it down to the other

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.990 
I'm going to pull it down to the other
end<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.490> side<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
end now see this is the back side and I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
end now see this is the back side and I
can<00:02:12.180> show<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.570> quick<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.020> you'll<00:02:13.140> have

can show you really quick so you'll have

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.640 
can show you really quick so you'll have
to<00:02:13.500> weave<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.850> these<00:02:14.970> ends<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.500> what

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to weave in some of these ends and what

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.830 
to weave in some of these ends and what
I<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> would<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.420> take

I will do for that is I would just take

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.970 
I will do for that is I would just take
this<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.530> place<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> yarn<00:02:21.180> needle<00:02:21.980> and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this and place it on a yarn needle and

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.130 
this and place it on a yarn needle and
if<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.430> want<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.060> kind<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.390> close<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.690> that

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
if you want you to kind of close up that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.560 
if you want you to kind of close up that
I<00:02:25.170> cord<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> back<00:02:26.160> side<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.520> little<00:02:26.910> bit<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I cord on the back side a little bit I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.820 
I cord on the back side a little bit I
guess<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.590> do<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
guess I like to do that and then you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.449 
guess I like to do that and then you
would<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.010> leave<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:34.160> pull<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> inside

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
would just leave it in pull it inside

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.600 
would just leave it in pull it inside
the<00:02:35.910> cord<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.220> could<00:02:38.459> take

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the cord and then you just could take

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.420 
the cord and then you just could take
your<00:02:38.790> scissors<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.330> snip<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:40.260> off<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.250> then

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
your scissors and snip that off and then

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.390 
your scissors and snip that off and then
that<00:02:44.610> will<00:02:44.790> stay<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.239> inside<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> cord<00:02:46.400> all

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that will stay right inside the cord all

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
that will stay right inside the cord all
right<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.420> see<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:49.110> starting

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
right so now I can see that I'm starting

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.810 
right so now I can see that I'm starting
on<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> wrong<00:02:49.950> side<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> pearl<00:02:51.290> which<00:02:52.820> it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
on a wrong side for the pearl which it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.910 
on a wrong side for the pearl which it
doesn't<00:02:54.090> matter<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.600> much<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.350> I'm<00:02:55.590> going

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
doesn't matter that much but I'm going

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
doesn't matter that much but I'm going
to<00:02:56.040> keep<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> consistent<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.299> first

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
to keep it consistent with the first

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.090
