BB<00:00:18.270> cream<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.289> actually<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> right

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
BB cream and I actually have it right

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
BB cream and I actually have it right
here<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.730> available<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.359> Sephora<00:00:21.779> right<00:00:22.020> now

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
here it's available at Sephora right now

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.089 
here it's available at Sephora right now
for<00:00:22.470> $39<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.060> color<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.380> dark<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
for $39 the color I use is in dark I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.620 
for $39 the color I use is in dark I
think<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:27.359> shades<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:29.640> think

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
think they have or shades and I think

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.420 
think they have or shades and I think
that<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> shades<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:32.070> good

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that the shades that they have are good

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.889 
that the shades that they have are good
but<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.759> course<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.210> gonna<00:00:33.329> need<00:00:33.570> lighter

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
but of course they're gonna need lighter

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.479 
but of course they're gonna need lighter
and<00:00:34.170> they're<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.800> need<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> little<00:00:35.309> bit

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
and they're going to need a little bit

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.930 
and they're going to need a little bit
darker<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.570> most<00:00:36.840> women<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
darker for most women that I know so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.790 
darker for most women that I know so
with<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.360> being<00:00:39.540> said<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:40.020> guess<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
with that being said I guess that is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 
with that being said I guess that is
definitely<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> blow<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> product<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> lot

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
definitely a blow of the product a lot

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.819 
definitely a blow of the product a lot
of<00:00:42.719> people<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.020> not<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.559> able<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of people are not going to be able to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
of people are not going to be able to
use<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.250> however<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.210> may<00:00:45.420> broaden<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> line

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
use it however they may broaden the line

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
use it however they may broaden the line
I<00:00:46.410> guess<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> catches<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
I guess if it catches on and this is not

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.369 
I guess if it catches on and this is not
something<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.510> heard<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> was

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
something that I heard from them I was

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
something that I heard from them I was
told<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> usually<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.850> happens

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
told this is usually what happens

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
told this is usually what happens
usually<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.690> happens<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:52.410> makeup<00:00:52.710> they

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
and you may be saying okay well what's
the<00:01:09.869> sense<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> actually<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> BB

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the sense of that this is actually a BB

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
the sense of that this is actually a BB
cream<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> beauty<00:01:13.140> balm<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> has

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
cream so it's a beauty balm so it has

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.370 
cream so it's a beauty balm so it has
more<00:01:14.420> cosmeceutical<00:01:15.420> purposes<00:01:15.900> rather<00:01:16.140> than

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
more cosmeceutical purposes rather than

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.170 
more cosmeceutical purposes rather than
just<00:01:16.619> being<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.130> foundation<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
just being a foundation and it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460 
just being a foundation and it's
supposed<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> help<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> look<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
supposed to help with the look and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.359 
supposed to help with the look and
texture<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:19.979> skin

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
texture of your skin

texture of your skin
now<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.580> haven't<00:01:21.030> noticed<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.360> yet<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
now I haven't noticed that yet because I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
now I haven't noticed that yet because I
haven't<00:01:22.350> been<00:01:22.439> using<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.220> long

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
haven't been using it for a very long

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.539 
haven't been using it for a very long
time<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> love<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.770> doing<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
time but I love the doing this that it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.270 
time but I love the doing this that it
gives<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:27.000> skin<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> has<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> dry<00:01:28.170> finish<00:01:28.619> so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
gives my skin and it has a dry finish so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800

very almost undetectable shimmer and the

only way I could tell is when I have it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520 
only way I could tell is when I have it
on<00:01:38.400> my<00:01:38.520> hands<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.540> look<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.170> closely

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
but what you can do is if this is almost

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
but what you can do is if this is almost
great<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.159> get
