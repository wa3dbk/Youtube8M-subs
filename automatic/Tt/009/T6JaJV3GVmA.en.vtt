00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello androids how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.779
 a new video so you've decided to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.429
 root your android device not very 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.469
 Well, you're in luck because today you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.450
 I bring a new application capable of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 Rootear a wide series of devices 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410
 android most of them and attention 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.770
 eye is the first one that gets it done 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.109
 with devices with android 5.0 and 5.1 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
 lollipop as well as obviously in 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.410
 lower versions 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.439
 previously get the root used 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 be more complex and elaborate 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 through processes that are exclusive 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 for your android device about 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 all because of the confidence issue of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 where these tools come from and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 these applications I usually recommend that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.300
 do the processes if they are available 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 if there is information on the internet 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.539
 through these exclusive processes for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 your android although they are a little more 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.989
 elaborated but luckily already makes a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 couple of years that applications like 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 frama root or togo the root do this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 experience of rooting the device 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 much more comfortable and without any risk 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 of damaging our device in case of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.809
 that they do not get it so much so if 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.489
 you have your device with android 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.439
 lollipop as with lower versions 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.010
 stay because here you will learn to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010
 surround it 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.729
 very well androids well in this video 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.920
 I will accompany in the routing of this 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.860
 device that if you are curious is 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.740
 the zte blade s6 that you see is 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.299
 running android 5.0 lollipop what 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.819
 first thing we have to do is from 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.710
 the security settings activate the 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.210
 origins of strangers or can 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.369
 also called unknown sources 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.829
 that will allow us to download 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.229
 we will urge freckles from our 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.539
 browser now yes we enter our 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.380
 browser and going to the web root king 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:48.170
 dot net root bar and you will see this 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.819
 web as you see skin root 4.0 and we give to 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.009
 this button that I already tell you that 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.170
 surely it means to download 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.789
 says it tells us that it can harm your 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.829
 our device this what usually 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.110
 say with all the applications we give to 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.549
 accept and wait for them to download 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.369
 very well then now that we have it 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.099
 installed, we are going to open it and now you have 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.420
 recognized that is a zte recognizes the 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.950
 system that we will have to give 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.569
 simply and this is extremely 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.700
 simple this 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.260
 says ruth and now we will simply have 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.129
 to wait for this counter to arrive 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.129
 one hundred percent 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.110
 and there are androids has already reached 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.810
 one hundred percent after a couple of minutes and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.670
 we will give this button blue google us 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.590
 He will say that what he does 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.170
 this application is to use an exploit 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.090
 to say violate the system and apply 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.769
 the root if you skipped a google ad 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.689
 simply give it to accept and now 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.489
 you will have your device rooted 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.500
 for that matter you will see that you have 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.780
 added a new application that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.030
 called king user that comes to be the same 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.680
 that super zoom here will tell you a little 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.659
 about the news and you will already have 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.760
 your device rooted for 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.040
 make sure it's rooted and it's been 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.920
 completed the process correctly as 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.810
 you can always go to ruth checker 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.090
 magnificent free application that is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.849
 in google play that basically will ask you 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.489
 let's say jump to the window that 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.650
 is if you want to grant in the permissions 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.389
 of superuser if you miss this window 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.989
 androids now we will give you accept 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.730
 we accept and such we verify the root and 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.930
 here already when we jump this little window 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.359
 which can be different in each 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.900
 device we give you to confirm and how 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.730
 we see congratulations 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.770
 let's say the superuser permissions are 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.330
 have applied correctly in this way 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.890
 so simple androids you can already 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.290
 use and enjoy all 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.030
 functionality of the applications that 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 they require the root of the modules of 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.440
 equipment to install roms and everything that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.730
 you want before doing it in 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.740
 your devices I recommend that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.690
 google is a bit to see if there is something 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.770
 in someone who has commented if it works 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.540
 or not even though I already tell you that if not 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.489
 it works simply is to wait for the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.930
 process like many will restart at 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.940
 mobile and you're not going to lose absolutely 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.100
 nothing but that in the vast majority of 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.959
 cases will root your device 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.580
 android so in androids up here 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.230
 today's video I hope you have 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.570
 liked and that you enjoy it now in 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.970
 go ahead and it turned out and you go to the channel 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.989
 if it may have arrived now and not 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.400
 You know very well what all this is about 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.010
 because here you will find the best 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.790
 information of all applications 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.790
 until the next androids
