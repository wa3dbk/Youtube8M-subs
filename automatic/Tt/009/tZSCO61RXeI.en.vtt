00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.290
So I had so much fun today with the Geigerrig
making dry ice close and seen how

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.390
much pressure it could take.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.010
What we are going to do is to put this one
with the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.930
dry ice at the top, the water at the bottom.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.470
Blow it into the pack and just see what

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.470
happens.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.470
We have no idea what will happen.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.470
So let us go for it.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.470
Here we go.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.470
We

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.430
put it in the pack, zipping it shut, (A guy
in the background said, "standing like

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.740
crazy").

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:31.619
Tuck in there like that and let it go.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.319
That's the pack swelling.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:39.420
Woah!

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.620
That is

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.730
okay.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.159
See that bladder expanding in there quite
a bit.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.579
Wait quite a bit.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.000
What we

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.429
anticipate what will happen is that the pressure
will continue to build inside the

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:02.609
bladder.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
And probably what will give is the top of
___ instead of the pack.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
The pack

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.420
gives first.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.720
I told you how was strong enough the bladder
is.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.009
Look at that.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.009
Look how

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.009
tight it is getting.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.390
You could not stop the pack that tight?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.390
No.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.390
No water coming out

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.390
of it.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.950
You could not stop anything on that pack to
make it that tight.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.630
Look at that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.840
thing.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.240
It is tight as its a drum.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.240
Tight as a drum?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
Haha..

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.640
Still nothing.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
I cannot believe

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.979
that.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.200
Oh my gosh.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.439
Zoom in on that.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.640
I got it.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.259
I cannot believe that it is something is

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.259
got to go.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.810
Oh my God, the pack it was before the freaking
bladder do.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.810
That is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.810
unbelievable.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.899
You could not stop that pack that tight.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.069
No.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.170
No way, no how.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.170
Be

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.220
careful Brock.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.830
Be careful Brock.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.150
Be careful.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.659
Oh, we missed him.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.590
He was behind the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.590
shield.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.940
I cannot believe that and that is still no
leaks, nothing.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.940
Nothing has given

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.570
on that Hydration Engine yet.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.799
None a drop of water.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.370
I dont hear any leaks.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.370
I can

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.269
hear the pack cracking but there is nothing
coming out of it.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.269
There is no water

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.390
coming out of it yet.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.720
Something has got to give.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.030
I can see the zipper mood just the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.030
___.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.239
The zipper has going to come off before anything
happens ____.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.239
If it close the

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.060
zipper first, I will be ___ my mind.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.430
I told you how strong the Hydration Engine
is.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.430
It

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.780
is that Geigerrig Hydration Engine.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.840
Look at that thing.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.900
It is tightly ____.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900
The zippers

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
are wiggling.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900
The zippers are dancing.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.080
Look at the hand tags on the zipper, its like

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
they wiggle.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080
Oh yes!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.209
A little bit.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.010
I cannot believe that.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.489
The pack might go first.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.489
Unbelievable.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.770
That is 1680 ballistic nylon.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.770
(Men laughing).

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.819
You see the zippers.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.129
You

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:46.879
think you can get the top view of it.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:04:10.770
We will walk around this way.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:31.250
Well, there no

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.250
leak.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.110
The air is still good.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.740
The pack can deflate.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.320
Right there, there you go.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.360
Let us see

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.270
what happen.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.530
The pack, good?

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.530
No.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.310
It was so struck.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.310
Finally.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.470
It blew the pack apart.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.250
That is the Hydration Engine.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.720
Eventually, it was so strong.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.010
It held so strong that it

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.910
blew the pack apart.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.380
That is how strong this hydration bladders
are.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.380
The Geigerrig

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380
Hydration Engine.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.380
How about that for testing?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.780
Now, that is testing.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.180
Okay, alright.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.180
So

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.790
we put that bomb inside the bladder with just
water and dry ice to create that

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.790
bomb.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.290
And it just getting tighter and tighter and
tighter.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.250
So strong was this, that it

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.510
eventually blew and blew the whole seams up.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.730
That is how hard, that is how much

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.170
pressure this took before it went.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.160
This is quite unbelievable to be honest.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160
This is

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160
fun.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.050
It is fun to test the product and it is fun
to test the Geigerrig.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.050
What do you

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.050
think Brock?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.050
Is it fun to test the Geigerrig?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.050
It is fun.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.050
what do you think Claire?

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.050
I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.050
love filming it.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.820
You guys have a good day.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.860
Take care.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.710
So we want to really do a close inspection
of this hydration engine.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.710
Some of the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.350
things that people ask is, "How well is that
slide top can hold?"

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.350
Look at that.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.350
The

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.720
slide top here is in pristine condition all
the way across.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.560
Nothing, no issues at all.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.050
On both of the slide tops.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.050
Okay?

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.311
Additionally, when you come down the seams,
all

00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:59.460
of the seaming around the outside held perfectly.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.460
All the way around on both

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.300
Hydration Engines . The seams held perfectly.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.240
Also, you can see right in here that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.810
the valves, no failure on the valves.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.150
And all of the valves are excellent on both

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.150
sides.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.490
the valves were just perfect.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.670
They did really well.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.180
So really what we had

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.509
here, is we had, I mean, this thing can hold
as much pressure as it you can actually

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.690
put into it for sure.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.150
You can jump on this things, beat on this
things and it went so

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.120
long, so powerful that it built up and eventually
blew the pack apart before it

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.120
failed.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.740
So anyway, the Geigerrig Hydration Engine.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.380
Have a great day.
