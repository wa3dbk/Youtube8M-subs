00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.340
 to yours 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.330
 Yeah sure 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.440
 bart is a standard transporter 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 silent with dimensions and weights 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.090
 reduced have a capacity of 24 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.950
 liters and is suitable for transport of 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.430
 up to 20 meters with a capacity 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.770
 up to one ton what are 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 the applications of bartz deposits 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.170
 They are versatile and easy to install 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.940
 Vaart is suitable for transporting 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.650
 dust and granules and I was 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.290
 particularly indicated for 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.269
 food products industries 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.370
 Chemical and pharmaceutical feature 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.960
 distinctive of the bart is that it does not require 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.820
 engineering design and the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.780
 Installation procedures are 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.150
 simple and immediate how they work 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.920
 the marc deposits are endowed with a 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.110
 load valve that opens to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.360
 allow the entry of material in the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.909
 propeller once the phase of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.590
 filling the valve closes the material 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.170
 begins to descend down the pipe 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.630
 pushed at a low speed until the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.760
 destination previously chosen when 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 the loaded material ends the line of 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.630
 transport remains empty and the valve 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.789
 load is opened again for 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.250
 start a new cycle thanks to its 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.740
 low height but can be installed 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 underneath in a hopper in a position of 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.149
 Breaks manual or discharger sacks 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.759
 super bags for transporting powder 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.149
 and great some contents in sacks and super 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.149
 bags 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.930
 and 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.109
 and
