00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 what is the truth hidden behind the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.569
 espionage before civilians like 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.080
 us that the president himself evo 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.030
 morals in view of the mere suspicion of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.190
 that he could be behaving 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 this man his aircraft was banned 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 sharply land in France 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 portugal and finally it had to be 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 led to another a real shame 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.960
 was you had I think 13 hours 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.390
 exactly 13 hours the plane stopped 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 not earthly plane registered a scanner 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.650
 named from the plane not here that a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.840
 president of a president is those 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 issues of july 2013 france and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.520
 portugal and did you not count 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:51.420
 pray here because you can put it on 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:54.980
 possibility that still can not what 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.980
 Putin does not do that to him 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 but neither is it casual that some 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 way could we say all his government 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.409
 have given him a hand without order and that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.530
 we have but you do not know 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.719
 of urgency your country for sick because 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.719
 because he is arrested by 3 other leaders 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.689
 we have the president of bolivia looking 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.609
 stopped practically wind is is 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.280
 cultured as to completely in your 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.530
 plane with the latest technology that he 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.299
 I was somehow guarding 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.099
 as well as a charge almost of polizonte 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.469
 grabbed his name was in australia 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.060
 they were cattle like the worst not even 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.860
 a common user but clearly 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 as someone suspected of committing a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.759
 crime or of great diplomats and days 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.039
 of 100 questions from other countries what 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 would happen if Argentina venezuela or 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.899
 Colombia would do the same to a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 president who I of France 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.909
 outside crossing argentine sky or sky 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.049
 how this was translated is because we are 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.409
 being completely unpublished 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.649
 the presidents a lack of respect 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.520
 Well exactly what Miguel Insurza 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.690
 about this one 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.100
 snub to say the least 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.520
 They gave the president of Bolivia a lot 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.040
 good attention michelle the lock ay 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.770
 let's see the graph of evo morals 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.290
 nothing nothing friend of mine and can not have a 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.870
 reason justifies an action of so much and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.540
 respect for the highest authority of a 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.030
 country the countries involved should give 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.710
 an explanation of the reason in the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.940
 which will make this decision by 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.210
 supposedly Miguel insulza secretary 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.460
 general of the oea this recent fresh 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.500
 last July 2, equal Latin 2003 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.390
 no matter what the oea or the un says 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.020
 truth is that the important countries of the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.810
 country 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.400
 very good door and sapone know what is 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.080
 the most incredible of the things that do not 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.440
 We have been able to learn about the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.020
 own snow der is that he knows that a 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.850
 can locate anyone in the 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.680
 world with whom you are speaking can 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.810
 Turn your cell phone into a 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.700
 microphone even if it's off for 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 listen to her convince and prevent this 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.530
 expression if someone wanted to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.810
 example matching text could be in all 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.970
 the phone's radius see how much gps 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.740
 how much phone and what person are we 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.900
 with him in these moments who is 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.770
 board all over to that end and that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.200
 extreme 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.050
 and in fact like snow in black only 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 he thought about these techniques he told that 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.130
 what he did so that they could not 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.110
 locate old notable listener to data 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.270
 observed a fact but here I never had 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 very extreme or blind genes but the 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.520
 own laughs and tactics please in the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.580
 graphic for me not identified snow 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.290
 he put his cell phone into the refrigerator or 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.410
 more or less more because the idea is 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.690
 block the radio signal that can be 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.420
 use to transmit voice data and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.920
 block everything absolutely the audio that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.200
 those who are going to see inexperienced a 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.450
 anti- surveillance device that what 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.190
 what I had to do the guy had to 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.950
 buy a cell phone like this after 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.290
 prepaid he spoke he broke and hers 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.400
 I had to keep it in case 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.530
 I can talk again 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.480
 publicly frozen in the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 refrigerator you can say that only so 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.250
 the signals not only arrive but 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.350
 they can not occupy the phone 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.180
 cell phone with a microphone to know that 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.739
 there is everything around and with whom 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.739
 speaking but seeks to live 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.830
 it will not be that at some point he sold 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.380
 the soul to the devil to work at the cia 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:39.290
 after he wants the CIA to send him 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:45.860
 to the pitanza that was this person and in 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:47.420
 some time the type of 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.290
 wounded safety problems there 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.290
 here all descend 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.590
 but there are many bad guys in these 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.750
 moments working against a lot of 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.750
 people that one has repented 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.640
 thank you very much that someone but that 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.410
 tell what others do not want because it is 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.210
 there they tell you about us we should not 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.790
 have our things because they watch over us 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.130
 let's say there are a number of things own 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.960
 country is where it explains all are put 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.300
 fingers the mouth that makes us three mind 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.710
 comes someone tells him with healthy life 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.410
 good person snowe 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.600
 auden obviously raised a letter commanded 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.130
 an international missive and he knows 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.740
 what are the consequences that says 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.590
 So this is what the former CIA agent says 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.480
 the enee be letter rafael strap 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.280
 president of ecuador that one of the 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.950
 possible places where it could have been 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.520
 base belts no matter and zebras do not 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.920
 see the days that I have left of life 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.920
 I will keep dedicated to fight for 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.510
 justice in an unequal world now I 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.240
 I keep free and able to publish 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.700
 information that serves the public interest 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.010
 but it is also clear that soon 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.300
 at any moment you can catch him and 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.610
 there he waits for you 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.050
 today they burn flags in bolivia 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.990
 Portuguese flag Italian flag and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.730
 other flags and I think that here they can 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.770
 occur march but that effectively 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.600
 to people who are respecting the 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.470
 rights the human rights of 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.080
 Privacy 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:29.850
 of freedom I believe that everyone 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.560
 when the 11 they can find out everything 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.990
 of anyone else 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.090
 already of the allowed even I mean 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.250
 that they can draw deductions and not 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.050
 You have to know something about you, Gonzalo. 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.580
 that can give you an idea of what I'm going 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.020
 to be watching years and if they 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.730
 they knew that those dangerous parents 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.770
 that can start to be impossible 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.160
 arrest you a series when something 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.160
 terrible
