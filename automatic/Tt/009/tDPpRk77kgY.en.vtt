answer a question that I've had for a
while<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.299> build<00:01:36.600> both<00:01:37.140> no<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.670> only

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
while can you build both no you can only

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.039 
while can you build both no you can only
build<00:01:39.299> robot<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:41.270> vehicle<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.780> parts

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
build robot or vehicle there are parts

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
build robot or vehicle there are parts
enough<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.470> both<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> I'm

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
enough for both but for this one I'm

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200 
enough for both but for this one I'm
going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> robot<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.880> because

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
going to go with the robot just because

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to go with the robot just because
I<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.390> that's<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.020> better<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I think that's going to look better and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
I think that's going to look better and
be<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:49.920> dynamic<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.060> before<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
be more dynamic but before we get to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
be more dynamic but before we get to
that<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.579> talk<00:01:53.790> about<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that we are going to talk about the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.260 
that we are going to talk about the
crayons<00:01:54.780> themselves<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:57.060> here

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
crayons themselves they are right here

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.620 
crayons themselves they are right here
on<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.509> first<00:01:57.780> page<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.210> pretty<00:02:00.210> much<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
on this first page and pretty much the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
on this first page and pretty much the
assembly<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> put<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> limbs<00:02:02.009> together<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
assembly is put the limbs together so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
assembly is put the limbs together so
we'll<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.719> ahead<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.170> take<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:04.979> at

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
we'll go ahead and a take a look at

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.819 
we'll go ahead and a take a look at
bumblebee<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:06.380> provoke<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.619> little

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
bumblebee here provoke them a little

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.080 
bumblebee here provoke them a little
baggie

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.490 

such<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.510> parts<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.050> fly<00:02:13.200> anywhere

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
such that the parts don't fly anywhere

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.560 
such that the parts don't fly anywhere
so<00:02:13.950> we've<00:02:14.250> got<00:02:15.290> arms<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.580> torso<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.420> arm

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
so we've got arms and torso and the arm

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.240

robot version I just need to do the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.959 
robot version I just need to do the
final<00:03:59.170> assembly<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.519> what<00:04:00.700> I'm<00:04:00.819> left

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
you can get some really dynamic poses

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.969 
the bumblebee now I do have a caveat I'm
probably<00:05:40.870> not<00:05:41.259> going<00:05:41.409> to<00:05:41.500> take<00:05:41.650> this<00:05:41.800> thing

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
probably not going to take this thing

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.640 
probably not going to take this thing
apart<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.490> fill<00:05:42.729> to<00:05:43.060> build<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.750> vehicle<00:05:44.530> mood

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
apart to fill to build the vehicle mood

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.640 
apart to fill to build the vehicle mood
because<00:05:45.610> quite<00:05:45.909> frankly<00:05:46.000> this<00:05:46.990> took<00:05:47.259> an<00:05:47.409> hour

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
because quite frankly this took an hour

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.279 
because quite frankly this took an hour
just<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.219> put<00:05:48.400> together<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:49.780> could<00:05:50.020> easily

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
just to put together it could easily

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.170 
just to put together it could easily
take<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:50.979> long<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.159> disassemble<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.090> then

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
take that long to disassemble and then

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.709 
take that long to disassemble and then
in<00:05:52.300> another<00:05:52.389> hour<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:53.050> put<00:05:53.199> together<00:05:53.320> again<00:05:53.650> I

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
in another hour to put together again I

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.860 
in another hour to put together again I
rather<00:05:55.719> like<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.979> robot<00:05:57.340> mode<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.820> this<00:05:58.659> is

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
rather like the robot mode and this is

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.810 
rather like the robot mode and this is
something<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.259> Lego<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.460> Mega<00:06:00.639> Bloks

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
something that Lego and Mega Bloks

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.689 
something that Lego and Mega Bloks
hasn't<00:06:01.449> really<00:06:01.659> succeeded<00:06:02.259> I<00:06:02.409> I<00:06:02.710> think<00:06:03.279> Hasbro

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
hasn't really succeeded I I think Hasbro

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.330 
hasn't really succeeded I I think Hasbro
really<00:06:04.270> has<00:06:04.419> a<00:06:04.449> winner<00:06:04.750> here<00:06:05.110> this<00:06:05.830> on<00:06:06.130> this

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
really has a winner here this on this

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.140

strongly<00:06:48.610> recommend<00:06:48.850> picking<00:06:49.389> up<00:06:49.570> some<00:06:49.810> of

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
strongly recommend picking up some of

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.770 
strongly recommend picking up some of
these<00:06:49.990> things<00:06:50.229> now<00:06:50.979> there<00:06:51.250> are<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:51.580> 799<00:06:52.479> I

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
these things now there are the 799 I

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.730 
these things now there are the 799 I
think<00:06:53.020> there<00:06:53.110> is<00:06:53.229> a<00:06:53.460> $17.99<00:06:54.660> $25.99<00:06:55.660> to<00:06:55.780> $29.99

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740
