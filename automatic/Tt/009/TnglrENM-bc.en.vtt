might want for rock climbing these are
all<00:00:05.970> technical<00:00:06.480> shoes<00:00:06.690> over<00:00:06.930> here<00:00:07.170> but<00:00:07.529> you've

shoes which you're not going to use for
the<00:00:11.070> technical<00:00:11.280> rock<00:00:11.670> climbing<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.360> they're

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the technical rock climbing but they're

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.570 
the technical rock climbing but they're
good<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.049> approach<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.040> hike<00:00:14.219> up<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> the

good if the approach the hike up to the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.330 
good if the approach the hike up to the
climb<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.849> steep<00:00:15.030> or<00:00:15.509> slick<00:00:15.980> often<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.070> will

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
climb is steep or slick often these will

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.769 
climb is steep or slick often these will
actually<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.789> sticky<00:00:18.180> rubber<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
actually have sticky rubber like the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.790 
actually have sticky rubber like the
rest<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> shoes<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:19.770> over

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
rest of the shoes we're going to go over

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
rest of the shoes we're going to go over
and<00:00:20.460> they're<00:00:20.580> basically<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.240> light<00:00:21.449> hiking

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and they're basically just light hiking

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
and they're basically just light hiking
shoes<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.529> use<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.430> where

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
shoes that you can use to get where

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.599 
shoes that you can use to get where
you're<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:24.150> safely<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
you're going more safely so in the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.040 
you're going more safely so in the
climbing<00:00:26.970> world<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.420> three<00:00:27.660> basic<00:00:27.810> types

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
climbing world there's three basic types

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
climbing world there's three basic types
of<00:00:28.439> shoes<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.039> first<00:00:29.279> one<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.849> lace-up

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of shoes the first one here is lace-up

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.040 
of shoes the first one here is lace-up
shoes<00:00:31.099> now<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.279> any<00:00:32.430> climbing<00:00:32.880> shoe<00:00:33.090> you've

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
shoes now with any climbing shoe you've

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.319 
shoes now with any climbing shoe you've
got<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.469> sole<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> shoe<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.880> with

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
got the the sole of the shoe is with

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
got the the sole of the shoe is with
sticky<00:00:36.750> rubber<00:00:36.870> which<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> rubber<00:00:38.040> that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sticky rubber which is rubber that's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
sticky rubber which is rubber that's
been<00:00:38.600> formulated<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> higher

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
been formulated to have a higher

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
been formulated to have a higher
friction<00:00:41.040> coefficient<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> rock<00:00:42.120> which

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
friction coefficient on the rock which

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.910 
friction coefficient on the rock which
basically<00:00:42.870> means<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> stick

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
basically means that it's going to stick

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
basically means that it's going to stick
to<00:00:44.129> rock<00:00:44.629> better<00:00:45.629> than<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:45.989> average<00:00:46.110> shoe

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to rock better than your average shoe

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
to rock better than your average shoe
sole<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> lace<00:00:50.700> ups<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
sole so the thing with the lace ups is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.500 
sole so the thing with the lace ups is
that<00:00:51.920> when<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.010> put<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.309> foot<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.360> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that when you put your foot in you can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
that when you put your foot in you can
dial<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> fit<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> dial<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> fit

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
dial up the fit you can dial in the fit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
dial up the fit you can dial in the fit
you<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.570> tie<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.109> tight<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.620> loose<00:00:58.680> as

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you can tie them as tight or as loose as

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
you can tie them as tight or as loose as
you<00:00:59.129> want<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.090> general<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.629> climbing

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you want and in general with climbing

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.950 
you want and in general with climbing
shoes<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.280> tighter<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:03.210> any

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
shoes you want them tighter than any

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.090 
shoes you want them tighter than any
other<00:01:04.170> shoe<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.559> ever<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> where

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
other shoe you're ever going to where

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
other shoe you're ever going to where
you<00:01:05.369> want<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> second

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you want to think of them like a second

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420 
you want to think of them like a second
skin<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.799> starting<00:01:07.979> out

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
skin so if you're just starting out

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
skin so if you're just starting out
lace-up<00:01:09.180> shoes<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.720> idea<00:01:10.049> because

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
lace-up shoes are a good idea because

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
lace-up shoes are a good idea because
even<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.310> too<00:01:11.460> big<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> first

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
even if you get them too big the first

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
even if you get them too big the first
time<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.600> always<00:01:12.780> lace<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.260> tighter

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
time you can always lace them up tighter

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.910 
time you can always lace them up tighter
and<00:01:13.799> they'll<00:01:14.340> work<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> long<00:01:15.000> run<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.860> we

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and they'll work in the long run and we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
and they'll work in the long run and we
can<00:01:17.040> move<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> step<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can move over to a kind of a step up in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.429 
can move over to a kind of a step up in
performance<00:01:19.740> often<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> velcro<00:01:21.030> shoe<00:01:21.570> for

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
performance often is the velcro shoe for

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
performance often is the velcro shoe for
those<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.710> us<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:23.100> lazy<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.700> untie<00:01:24.150> her<00:01:24.210> shoes

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
those of us too lazy to untie her shoes

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
those of us too lazy to untie her shoes
after<00:01:24.750> every<00:01:25.080> climb<00:01:25.700> these<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.880> great

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
after every climb these are great

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.490 
after every climb these are great
compromise<00:01:27.600> often<00:01:28.140> they're<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.439> more

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
compromise often they're a lot more

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
compromise often they're a lot more
aggressive<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.939> means<00:01:30.210> they're<00:01:30.479> turned<00:01:31.020> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
aggressive which means they're turned in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
when you put your toe in the shoe it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.380 
when you put your toe in the shoe it's
going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> curl<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.270> you're

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
going to curl up in there and you're

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
going to curl up in there and you're
going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.630> able<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> toe<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.439> rock<00:01:37.680> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
lace-up shoes because in the long run

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.390 
lace-up shoes because in the long run
those<00:02:34.470> are<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.890> easiest<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
those are going to be the easiest and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
those are going to be the easiest and
most<00:02:35.430> versatile
