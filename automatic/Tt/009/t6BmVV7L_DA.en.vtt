course of second bottle cage you can

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.330 
course of second bottle cage you can
take<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.769> bottle<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:28.039> now<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> easiest

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
take this bottle out now the easiest

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.389 
take this bottle out now the easiest
thing<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.550> do<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.939> hand<00:00:31.160> nursery<00:00:32.160> stock

bottle<00:00:32.790> cage<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> comes<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.480> bike

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
bottle cage that comes with this bike

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.020 
bottle cage that comes with this bike
you<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.300> screwed<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> frame<00:00:38.030> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you see it's screwed into the frame but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.729 
you see it's screwed into the frame but
this<00:00:39.180> bike<00:00:39.420> frame<00:00:39.660> does<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.230> any<00:00:40.500> holes

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
this bike frame does not have any holes

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.850 
this bike frame does not have any holes
back<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:42.110> second<00:00:43.110> bottle<00:00:43.379> cage<00:00:43.559> all

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
back here for a second bottle cage all

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.260 
back here for a second bottle cage all
the<00:00:44.070> GM<00:00:44.280> silly<00:00:44.670> rode<00:00:44.820> bikes<00:00:45.289> don't<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
the GM silly rode bikes don't like that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
the GM silly rode bikes don't like that
so<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.440> take

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so basically all I have to do is take

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
so basically all I have to do is take
your<00:00:50.309> section<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.820> inner<00:00:51.030> tube<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.710> slice

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
your section of inner tube and slice

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.889 
your section of inner tube and slice
that<00:00:52.920> section<00:00:53.399> off<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.910> rubber<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> used<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that section off this rubber is used to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.630 
that section off this rubber is used to
protect<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.440> bike<00:00:55.620> frame<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> actually

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
protect the bike frame and to actually

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.450 
protect the bike frame and to actually
give<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> better<00:00:57.719> friction<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.980> hold<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
give you better friction to hold this on

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.080 
give you better friction to hold this on
better<00:01:00.410> you'll<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.850> good-quality<00:01:02.850> zip

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
better you'll need two good-quality zip

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.230 
better you'll need two good-quality zip
ties<00:01:03.449> good<00:01:03.870> heavy-duty<00:01:04.229> zip<00:01:04.530> ties<00:01:05.240> basically

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
ties good heavy-duty zip ties basically

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.350 
ties good heavy-duty zip ties basically
you'll<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.780> those<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.080> zip<00:01:07.290> ties<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
you'll just put those two zip ties on

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
you'll just put those two zip ties on
one<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> bottle<00:01:10.350> cage

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
one on this side of the bottle cage

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460 
one on this side of the bottle cage
mount<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.780> side<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> ball<00:01:13.260> cage

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
mount and then on this side a ball cage

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
mount and then on this side a ball cage
mount<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> course<00:01:15.600> you'll<00:01:15.810> put<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> inner

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
mount and of course you'll put the inner

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
mount and of course you'll put the inner
tube<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.860> under<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.720> all<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tube up under that you put all this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
tube up under that you put all this
together<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.560> clamp<00:01:20.520> these<00:01:20.640> things<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.030> as

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
together and clamp these things down as

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
together and clamp these things down as
tight<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.939> that<00:01:23.939> gives<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
tight as you can and that gives you a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
tight as you can and that gives you a
bottle<00:01:25.080> cage<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.409> works<00:01:25.590> fairly<00:01:25.799> well<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
bottle cage that works fairly well and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850 
bottle cage that works fairly well and
of<00:01:26.939> course<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.200> expect<00:01:28.500> there's<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.770> be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
of course as we expect there's gonna be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
of course as we expect there's gonna be
some<00:01:29.070> plant<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.450> asked<00:01:30.930> us<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> be

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
some plant but they asked us to be

frame or if you have an adapter doesn't
quite<00:01:50.090> fit<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:51.409> can<00:01:51.560> give<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:51.890> try<00:01:53.140> and

quite fit you can give this a try and

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.749 
quite fit you can give this a try and
chances<00:01:54.560> are<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:55.009> zip<00:01:55.220> ties<00:01:55.399> at<00:01:55.610> home

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
chances are you have zip ties at home

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.880 
chances are you have zip ties at home
you<00:01:55.939> probably<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:56.810> bike<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.439> bow<00:01:57.590> home<00:01:57.740> if

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
you probably have a bike to bow home if

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.830 
you probably have a bike to bow home if
you<00:01:58.039> already<00:01:58.310> been<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:58.970> cycling<00:01:59.479> for<00:01:59.630> quite<00:01:59.810> a
