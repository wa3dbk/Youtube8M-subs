a more detailed look at the keyboard now

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.250 
a more detailed look at the keyboard now
now<00:03:02.820> let's<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.240> look<00:03:03.540> at<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.990> keyboard

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
itself so here is the de novo keyboard

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.990 
itself so here is the de novo keyboard
unpackaged<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.920> as<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.070> said<00:03:11.130> before<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.670> nice

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000

will do is attract a lot of fingerprints

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.590 
will do is attract a lot of fingerprints
you<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.450> try<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:27.930> now<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:30.360> the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
you just try that right now and on the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.130 
you just try that right now and on the
back<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:31.850> it's<00:03:32.850> pretty<00:03:33.090> thin<00:03:33.420> pretty<00:03:33.840> thin

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
back here it's pretty thin pretty thin

back here it's pretty thin pretty thin
profile<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:36.140> here's<00:03:37.140> where<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.500> batteries

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
profile and here's where the batteries

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.690 
profile and here's where the batteries
are<00:03:38.310> kept<00:03:39.120> right<00:03:39.600> here<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.800> if<00:03:40.950> i<00:03:41.040> open<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.520> up

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
so there you go so overall I think that

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.740 
so there you go so overall I think that
this<00:07:03.009> is<00:07:03.069> a<00:07:03.189> very<00:07:03.310> good<00:07:03.430> keyboard<00:07:03.819> and<00:07:04.599> that

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
this is a very good keyboard and that

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.379 
this is a very good keyboard and that
you<00:07:04.930> should<00:07:04.960> get<00:07:05.289> it<00:07:05.500> um<00:07:06.090> one<00:07:07.090> of<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:07.240> things

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389 
you should get it um one of the things

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.480 
you should get it um one of the things
that<00:07:07.539> you<00:07:07.659> do<00:07:07.840> have<00:07:08.020> to<00:07:08.169> watch<00:07:08.349> out<00:07:08.560> for<00:07:08.590> is<00:07:09.069> the

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490 
that you do have to watch out for is the

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.809 
that you do have to watch out for is the
piano<00:07:10.000> back<00:07:10.960> like<00:07:11.469> the<00:07:11.620> glossy<00:07:12.069> finish<00:07:12.400> on<00:07:12.639> the

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
piano back like the glossy finish on the

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:15.209 
piano back like the glossy finish on the
back<00:07:12.939> of<00:07:13.090> the<00:07:13.180> keyboard<00:07:13.569> because<00:07:14.009> it<00:07:15.009> will

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:15.219 
back of the keyboard because it will

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:16.559 
back of the keyboard because it will
attract<00:07:15.550> a<00:07:15.580> lot<00:07:15.789> of<00:07:15.819> fingerprints<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:16.389> dust

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
attract a lot of fingerprints and dust

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.809 
attract a lot of fingerprints and dust
so<00:07:16.960> just<00:07:17.229> keep<00:07:17.500> a<00:07:17.650> can<00:07:17.860> of<00:07:18.069> compressed<00:07:18.340> air

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:18.819 
so just keep a can of compressed air

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.939 
so just keep a can of compressed air
