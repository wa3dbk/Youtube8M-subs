00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.200
 hello that such friends I am mica vicente and 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.440
 today we are going to do a craft 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.720
 fun and super easy practice for the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 Valentine's Day I will explain what 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.350
 we need 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.720
 ah 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.640
 for this activity it is enough to need 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.160
 ribbon reason a rule glue scissors 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.090
 a compass a pen and paper or 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.090
 colour cardboard 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 we started we took a paper one of them 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.780
 and what we do is mark a diameter 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 of 10 centimeters we mark the point 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 medium and we perform a semi 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 circumference with the cone we give lines 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.550
 vertical until the end of our 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 paper we mark the points again 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.980
 means are left between the lines so that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 we find four vertical strips 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.820
 now we are going to cut it down no matter what 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.379
 you can see the lines of the pencil because 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.850
 then they will be hidden by our 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.989
 heart we will turn around and what 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.989
 we will leave in the back 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.490
 we cut one by one does not have to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.369
 what is accurate is not important 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 but the more straight cuts the better clear 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.450
 well now we take the other folio we have 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.890
 chosen the yellow color for you to see 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 well the result and contrast with the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 red we are today a little patriotic what 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.490
 that we do the same thing 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 semicircle and the four lines 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 vertical 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.490
 we marked the points if the diameter was 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.980
 of 10 well you know at zero point in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.620
 the two and a half in the five in the seven and 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.240
 medium in 10 again so they turn out 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.220
 our four strips 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.330
 we cut 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.330
 the best we can 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.030
 very well then we have already 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.570
 the two or the two parts of the heart 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.940
 cut out now comes how difficult are you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 prepared come now we have to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.340
 interlacing the strips with each other 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.650
 as if it were a basket one up one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.150
 down one up one down can 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.860
 be a bit confusing but surely 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.460
 you take the trick in the end is not so 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.160
 difficult as it seems 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.470
 you take the second strip now take the 3rd 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.380
 strip and then do the opposite of the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.670
 previous strip down up up down 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.670
 very well we have the last 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.050
 and we already have our heart for both 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.960
 sides so we have to do for 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.830
 remove the excess we take the scissors 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.690
 and we cut it 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.570
 so that the result is a little more 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.880
 adjusted what we are going to do is paste 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.340
 each of the fringes that come out of the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 heart on both sides a little bit of 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.880
 glue will be enough besides this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.000
 will help not to move our 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.980
 heart 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.380
 If you want, you can finish adjusting the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.290
 cut out see how it has been left for 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.810
 is a perfect heart good then 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.930
 here we have it now what we are going to 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 to do is cut some strips with the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.040
 excess paper one centimeter wide 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.140
 approximately you can help with the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.910
 rule if you want and we paste it by the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.390
 back that is where they will look 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.080
 our pencil stripes 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.080
 OK 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.540
 Well now we perform the same operation 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.060
 and we make another heart of them 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.520
 measurements we cut the back strip and what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.440
 What we do is fold the strip so that 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.840
 there is a kind of washer or ring 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.000
 this is going to help us build a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.640
 good evil for example or for what 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.770
 you want to use we passed our strip or 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.830
 cord or tie or what you have that you 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.510
 like and tie some knots in each of 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.180
 the washers that we have left in the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.930
 hearts 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.909
 you see very easy now you can follow 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.980
 adding more hearts to form a 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.810
 You can place a long garland 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.450
 in the room in the room or as 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.730
 headboard of the bed with below 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.950
 let's make one but smaller 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.799
 just half of five centimeters 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.900
 in diameter so you know we're going to 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:16.150
 make quickie because it's just like 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.150
 before but smaller 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.180
 maybe you find it more difficult here 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.860
 interlace the strips but good always 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.389
 you can separate it and start over 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.389
 you will find the trick 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.139
 we already have it cut out we paste and 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.080
 ready 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.150
 here we are going to make a small variable 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.909
 today we are going to make a hole with our 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.680
 die-cutter or with a toothpick or the same 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.039
 pen what you have by hand or a 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.110
 folios hole also serves and 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.229
 We will pass a ribbon or ribbon that you have 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.419
 by hand or that you like with the measure that 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.430
 You see in the tutorial it's enough because 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.199
 what we are going to do is surround a 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.289
 napkin can be with cutlery 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.990
 like us or are the cutlery to mode 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.219
 of napkin ring in another tutorial os 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.219
 we will teach how to fold the napkin 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.900
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.460
