00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 how are I very happy because 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
 also today I am a year older is my 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 birthday so I accept all kinds of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.030
 comments and likes I also thought of a 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
 program that helps us all to the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
 plaquitas to the llenita to the gorditas 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.150
 that the truth favor us and I'm going to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.920
 talk about clothes and accessories that we 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.920
 they make see thinner let's see them 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.600
 and if we want to see the color thin 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.149
 basic is the black could also use 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.339
 navy blue or coffee but black there is no 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.199
 loses is the basic basic color for 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.300
 achieve but it's not much more stylized 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.339
 and thin your little witch let's start 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.649
 above your blouse can not be neither 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.019
 very tight or very loose there is going 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.120
 because very loose is going to make you see more 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.909
 big and it's going to be like that you see 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.290
 broader and pegadita you do not see when 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.049
 really what you want to hide 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.979
 then look for your blouse to be 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.750
 perfectly of your size if you do not know 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.310
 what is your size always proves that a 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.899
 bigger and a smaller one so that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.570
 see which is the most because it favors 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.880
 the pants the pants could 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.800
 be jeans or pants if they are jeans 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 they choose the darkest color they are 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.819
 very dark they are also elegant that we 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.960
 they can go out at night then they're going to 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.030
 love the idea I'm using 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.729
 black pants these pants or 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.770
 skinny jeans are all pegaditos but if 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.659
 your legs are a little more chubby 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.580
 the biggest thighs or are you every 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.560
 little bag what is going to fit you best is 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.840
 the straight cut the straight cut is the one that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.750
 going from the knee down in 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.530
 straight fall more or less this fall that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.600
 makes the leg 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 much thinner and much more stylized 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.320
 the accessories in the accessories we 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.640
 let's have fun we're not going to any 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.380
 funeral we do not have to be all 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.140
 dressed in black of course not 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 the shoes the necklace the bag there 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.259
 we can put color I wanted the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.750
 shoes were also in a neutral tone 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.790
 but that also are not shoes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.159
 knots to these why why are they going to 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.710
 make ourselves look better than ever 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.270
 higher is a much much more posture 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.009
 Right that is going to make us follow them 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.050
 I feel also thinner the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.600
 accessories necklaces bracelets or 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.130
 rings can call you use can 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.410
 get attention with them can be 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.510
 large but preferably that the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.400
 necklaces be along because because 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.080
 if we have a very rough necklace that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.180
 reach this height because nothing else we are going 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 to attract attention to this section 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 and what we want is something a little more 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.150
 stylized we want to be seen 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.739
 for here not that they are not a little more 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.019
 elongated then I'm using a 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.840
 very cute necklace too little is also 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.280
 an elongated necklace with some design there 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.110
 many types of necklaces I'm 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.300
 sure you really like using this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.830
 type of necklaces the bag your bag 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.510
 it also has to be in proportion to you 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.120
 you can not use a bag or so big 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.470
 not so small if you are a little bit more 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.650
 big is about your bags being 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.319
 mediums that have I do not know any cut 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.819
 rectangular you can not choose because I know 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.890
 always looking for a balance and always 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.640
 than to think how we will see much more 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.640
 stylized 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 we continue with looks also with the color 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.070
 black but let's put another color on 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.380
 white and also this shirt is ideal 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.120
 because because it has vertical lines what 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.040
 that makes us look much thinner 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.620
 opt for the vertical lines apart 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.970
 of the trend of the stripes right now is 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.070
 fuertÃ­sima then also they are 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.100
 to see the fashion they are going to look very, very 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.290
 well very thin taco tacos or 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.520
 the jackets you use when you use them 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.960
 use them below the hip more or 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.090
 less at this height because because if 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.850
 you have big hip or big thighs 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.920
 you are going to disguise them a lot, opt for 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.050
 this type of bags with straight cut you 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.090
 they're going to make it look very stylized 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.800
 I'm wearing leggings but leggings 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.240
 black the black leggings that are going to 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.810
 make us look like some legs 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.700
 much prettier much more shapely 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.470
 the shoes we always talked about 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.180
 they have to be high shoes this core 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.010
 against ideal to work I'm 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.840
 using a little heel just a little bit 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.270
 heel but if heel to follow 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.160
 maintaining the perfect posture and 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.720
 finally the bag the bag we talked 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.430
 that it has to be in proportion I 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.600
 I found this in medium size is ideal 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.290
 for the day and you'll help 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.290
 a lot to look 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.570
 and if they have a formal event they want 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.640
 make a skirt which is best for them 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.310
 to stay if they want to look thin is the 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.590
 straight cut a straight cut that is not 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.510
 very close to help us hide that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.970
 that we do not want to teach maybe thighs 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.760
 big or hip a very very cut 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.250
 simple that will also favor them 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.110
 anyone this skirt has a little bit 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.150
 of blue we talked that the navy blue and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.530
 the black are very good friends and very 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.840
 good allies when we want to see each other 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.730
 thin the shirt is a shirt very 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.940
 basic also look for that I do not know 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.710
 I saw neither too big nor too tight 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.960
 balanced everything perfect accessories 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.150
 the necklace is still long as 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.120
 we talked to see each other so much 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.830
 more elongated shoes shoes 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.140
 They are ideal to go out at night are 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.900
 high shoes that will keep us with 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.330
 the beautiful coquettes height and finally 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.790
 the bag this bag is a little more 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.320
 oval is small ideal to use 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.190
 during the night and it looks really good 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.190
 also with this look 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.290
 and if the dress is a black look 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.780
 3 will get you out of any trouble you are looking for 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.760
 that also be in straight cut accentuate 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.550
 the most use it a little more credit of 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.740
 up and down and down or everything 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.290
 loose as you like and how best you 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.720
 is the accessories here are key to 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.880
 go up much much more the look first to 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.950
 necklace a necklace as we talked is 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.990
 long although it is very striking is a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.580
 class statement of those necklaces that 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.900
 let's see a lot that they call 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.180
 very much the attention that nothing else with 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.790
 this with nothing else with this necklace you do 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.740
 the look this necklace is ideal because it 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.220
 I say that it is at the same time that it is very 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.170
 very loaded is along along the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.380
 shoes shoes also have something 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.660
 of color I decided to use them very very flirty 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.190
 and very fun to go out at night 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.680
 we do not have to use everything dark we can 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.880
 use neon colors is a little bit of everything 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.560
 and finally the bag I did not want 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.270
 put a lot of color because it already brought 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.770
 enough in the accessories and I wanted to use 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.770
 a very neutral bag in black 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.900
 and they already saw that there are garments that can 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.520
 do wonders for us taking 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.680
 have different body types so 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.050
 you adapt the look that you liked best 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.010
 I'm sure you're going to see 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.540
 spectacular I leave all my 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.760
