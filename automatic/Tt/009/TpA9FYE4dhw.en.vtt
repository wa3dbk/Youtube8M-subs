00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.779 
and it's a very nice afk skill the last
method<00:05:25.110> has<00:05:25.410> two<00:05:25.620> parts<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.370> that<00:05:26.639> is

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
method has two parts to it and that is

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.480 
method has two parts to it and that is
wood<00:05:27.030> cutting<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:27.570> want<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.440> include<00:05:28.710> ivy<00:05:29.250> and

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
wood cutting I want to include ivy and

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.570 
wood cutting I want to include ivy and
crystal<00:05:30.000> trees<00:05:30.300> one<00:05:30.900> because<00:05:31.349> Ivy<00:05:31.889> even<00:05:32.280> at<00:05:32.430> my

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
crystal trees one because Ivy even at my

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.210 
crystal trees one because Ivy even at my
high<00:05:32.820> level<00:05:32.849> is<00:05:33.360> still<00:05:33.900> very<00:05:34.139> good<00:05:34.320> you<00:05:35.099> could

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
high level is still very good you could

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.270 
high level is still very good you could
stand<00:05:35.520> here<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.090> if<00:05:36.510> you're<00:05:36.750> in<00:05:37.200> super<00:05:37.830> AFK

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
stand here and if you're in super AFK

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.520 
stand here and if you're in super AFK
mode<00:05:38.550> there<00:05:39.330> will<00:05:39.450> always<00:05:39.630> be<00:05:39.750> ivy<00:05:40.200> in<00:05:40.260> front

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
mode there will always be ivy in front

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.810 
mode there will always be ivy in front
of<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> because<00:05:40.950> they<00:05:41.099> respond<00:05:41.490> rate<00:05:41.639> is

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
of you because they respond rate is

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.270 
of you because they respond rate is
great<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:43.110> believe<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.530> voice<00:05:43.680> esaron

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
great and I believe the voice esaron

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.920 
great and I believe the voice esaron
makes<00:05:44.490> them<00:05:44.729> last<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:45.150> little<00:05:45.300> bit<00:05:45.389> longer<00:05:45.510> if

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
makes them last a little bit longer if

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.620 
makes them last a little bit longer if
it's<00:05:46.110> not<00:05:46.289> these<00:05:46.530> is<00:05:46.889> the<00:05:47.370> it's<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.360> trees

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
to one that is activated you just mine

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.310 
to one that is activated you just mine
or<00:06:44.280> not<00:06:44.430> mine<00:06:44.760> you<00:06:45.030> can<00:06:45.150> hack<00:06:45.390> and<00:06:45.720> all<00:06:46.200> of

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
or not mine you can hack and all of

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.350 
or not mine you can hack and all of
these<00:06:46.470> get<00:06:46.860> some<00:06:47.220> great<00:06:47.520> wood<00:06:47.730> cutting<00:06:48.030> XP

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
these get some great wood cutting XP

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.540 
these get some great wood cutting XP
definitely<00:06:48.810> better<00:06:48.960> than<00:06:49.050> IV<00:06:49.590> but<00:06:50.100> IV<00:06:50.430> is

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
definitely better than IV but IV is

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.300 
definitely better than IV but IV is
still<00:06:50.760> decent<00:06:51.180> I<00:06:51.390> mean<00:06:51.690> it's<00:06:52.110> around<00:06:52.530> 100<00:06:52.770> XP

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
still decent I mean it's around 100 XP

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.200 
still decent I mean it's around 100 XP
off<00:06:53.520> per<00:06:54.020> chomp<00:06:55.020> and<00:06:55.470> it<00:06:56.280> just<00:06:56.610> depends<00:06:57.000> on<00:06:57.150> how

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
off per chomp and it just depends on how

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.180 
off per chomp and it just depends on how
lucky<00:06:57.450> you<00:06:57.660> get<00:06:57.780> I<00:06:57.870> guess<00:06:58.080> but<00:06:58.860> that's<00:06:59.040> gonna
