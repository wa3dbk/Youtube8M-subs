00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 or the one that you see me as it has taken people 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.170
 from samsung on taking a second 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 generation of your smart watch ie 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 they are samson 10 and here I have them the sant 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:24.930
 it went up 2 and those are winds 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 I read the case is that they have enough 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 improvements with respect to the first model 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.210
 as for example the fact that in the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 straps there is nothing nothing nothing 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 electronic this makes the straps 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.610
 are interchangeable with which we can 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 change style whenever we want 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 of course if we have any problems or 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 whatever it is, it 's a lot cheaper 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 repair or this one breaks the strap and already 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 are you changing it so where have they put 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 the camera the microphone and everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 had previous model then directly 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 in the stainless steel box you see that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.170
 part of there good in story this is the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.530
 day 2 day 2 is the end for now 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 2 megapixel camera this is the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.920
 day 2 leo does not incorporate the camera but 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.439
 I'm going to continue with the day 2 camarita here 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.700
 next to it has an infrared emitter something 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.869
 again also with respect to the previous 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.560
 generation and that makes us able 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.080
 use the watch as a remote control 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.580
 there's the interface and it's not very good 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.710
 different from the interface that the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.509
 previous guide but inside yes it is 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.850
 very different because it is based on 15 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.979
 of the samsung operating system is 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.069
 compatible when it hits the market will be 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.819
 compatible better said with about 20 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:41.780
 galaxy devices and for example then 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.620
 I'm going to open the pedometer part 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.670
 as well 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.950
 50 with gyroscope accelerometer photometer 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.920
 and something new also that these have 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.920
 devices is what I'm going to teach 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.450
 the heart rate meter 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 also so that we can have it in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 any frequency and tells us by 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.180
 Of course the clock shows us all the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.780
 notifications that we can receive in 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.910
 our galaxy s 5 or devices 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 compatible, all we need is 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.830
 have the clock application and for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.470
 supposed to stop it by means of titles 4.0 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.170
 the screens are still 1.63 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.090
 inches and 320 x 300 pixels of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.130
 resolution with which the screen is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.400
 square inside uses a 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.160
 dual-core processor and in here if you go 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.959
 a look at the neo what you see is that 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.170
 it's a little easier, it has the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.660
 infrared over here below we have 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.049
 also the frequency meter 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.450
 heart and this model weighs 55 grams and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.220
 this one weighs 68 grams have increased 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.660
 also the battery in principle the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.890
 change in operating system seems to be 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.630
 that has seated them quite well and 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.520
 they undertake a day because it lasts 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.650
 approximately 1 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.910
 the three days with more intensive and if it is 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.310
 less intensive can last 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.840
 up to six one of the things that we 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.820
 they seemed absolutely incomprehensible 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.010
 in the previous generation it was a clock 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 which is used for athletes and that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.990
 it did not resist absolutely any water 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.090
 but not just water from the megabytes but 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.460
 that neither rain nor humidity nor anything 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.990
 so on this occasion they have 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.480
 changed and they have also put the 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.250
 standard ip67 ie submersible 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.230
 for 30 minutes to one meter of 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 depth to make sure that the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.140
 athletes or when it rains they are not 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.270
 spoils your galaxy guide has also 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.010
 You changed the charging system you remember 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.350
 that used to open up as a kind of 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.450
 backpack is one thing if you got the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.430
 device and it closed on this occasion 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.090
 what they have done is something a little more 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.730
 small 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.860
 these are the pins would go connected 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.730
 directly to 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.980
 well and good I'm placing it 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.990
 that way but you can imagine it and 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.140
 then from here to a microusb connection 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.030
 already the electric current so good 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.300
 This has been a first contact with the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.160
 new days the same as I was saying 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.600
 with the s5 at the moment we have no price 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.530
 but we do know that it will reach 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.060
 market on April 11 to about 150 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.220
 countries a lot we hope to try them 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.730
 also in early warning and be able to send another 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.730
 for now
