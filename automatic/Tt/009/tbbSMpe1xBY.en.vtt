00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 so girls will go there and I will 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.430
 put a cup 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.779
 okay but a chip is quite big boy of 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.910
 rice is and I will put sock type because 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.130
 respect I have to wait 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.410
 He's a little bigger, yes, yes. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.749
 how to make a cup and a half I'm 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.119
 using this reason I prefer rice that 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:30.390
 do not be valued tac is that rice 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.880
 normal or cheaper where you have it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.880
 and now we will ask 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:52.449
 feel a little bit and from the angel to Lent 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:58.489
 and it hits again and it's okay, people 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:01.659
 knows the importance that the mass here looks 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.129
 How did you stay alone with me? 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.680
 now you're going to get a virose wine 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.670
 with a sieve so we'll improve this 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.009
 rice 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560
 You pick it up and Rose stays here. 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.580
 and put it in the cup. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.740
 then we're leftover trifle here 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.039
 Rice is just a little bit like that. 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.690
 compare so much that yields hour 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.509
 rendered are here but this one I do not 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.700
 I know that he'll put it on 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.520
 another phase line and the day that I want 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.080
 to make a kind of chamomile tea I 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.500
 I put Chávez indicated the name there. 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.960
 inside is and passed in the face that helps give 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 one calmed the pimples these things 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.590
 like this 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.899
 I'll come back and pozinho targets for 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:56.330
 kaká hit to meet blender and 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.810
 I'm going to hit a little more 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.509
 I think of sifting 6-star people but there 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.420
 will you be able to taste the customer that 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.239
 I like it, it's fine because I 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.849
 I can use this mix up here to 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.819
 do skin cleansing too why 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.090
 I like to make it look fine, and I 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.370
 I think it's better than the sugar I see 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 a lot of people talk does skin cleansing 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.480
 with sugar I prefer this one here I am 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.980
 I'll show you why. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.989
 so everything good that it gave from here 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.400
 Look how much order is left for us. 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.190
 thin 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 the goal is to stay well 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.890
 thin 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.650
 in this case you may want to make a 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 exfoliation it does not attack both the skin 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.370
 is the sugar is sometimes irritating to the skin 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.890
 for he held something like that and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.170
 This one is fine, fine one. 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.819
 very dusty 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.569
 Now I'm going to put this mixture in 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.569
 pot here 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.040
 so boy here is everything that we 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.210
 You need to make our face but it ta 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.520
 rojo batidinho already venerated and everything else and 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.490
 I 'll just put it here and measure it 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.060
 For you to have a notion, then I 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.720
 I'll put a deadly two spoon 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.430
 I do not do the measurement, do not choose well. 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:28.180
 and sky very full on and I'll put it now 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.010
 a little bit of that actually people 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.530
 is the text this mask with several 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.990
 soaps and everything else that I most 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.220
 I liked it with this soap the mix 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.350
 of soap with this soap here 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.260
 cologne and milk soap 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.460
 colony is in my opinion that was the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.150
 best way 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.150
 this mask 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:58.410
 so now I'll put a little 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.410
 here and if both 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.930
 I already do well, gold, you know I already know 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.950
 what is the texture that I like and everything 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 more 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.599
 and now I'm going to put this foam 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.599
 here together it's ok, let's go there 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.270
 the state says lung 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.800
 I got this much foam that is 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.400
 Now you're going to mix well. 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:49.070
 Soft for you, do not take this effect 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.490
 of the foam is in this focus here you go 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:56.900
 stir well to smooth vc not both lose 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.639
 espuminha same thing you also 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.419
 Chechen, a loaf of bread, okay. 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.100
 slowly 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.100
 the camera is blurring 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.570
 so people here she stays this way 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.110
 So well aerated, it's even here for me. 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.990
 I'm going to add four more buns 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.040
 I like her faster 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.340
 I took time to move it and it ended 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.900
 little foam that the cap broke down here 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.120
 inside 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:43.300
 It's okay, but her texture is fine. 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.670
 firm neighbor very firm even people look 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.390
 for example the attack on the harvest and 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.870
 do not cost fall know arrive do not fall from 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.450
 Pot if you see it that way 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.510
 What you do is she does not even get to 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:02.080
 fallen can here for me this texture 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.820
 The ideal of this mask is only for you. 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.820
 have an idea how she stays here 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.370
 she stays like this and I'll pass it on 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.100
 way here across my face I're 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.190
 I prefer to go with the spatula without so 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.540
 I'm going through and a half depositing 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:30.310
 in the face of acim sale and leave act 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:32.500
 around a quarter of an hour and she 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.650
 It will turn red in your face. 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.350
 Then you go and it's after she had 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.020
 here you will come with a wet hand to 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.210
 pass on her good looking hand 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.610
 time you have all the wet mask of 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.700
 new you can have circular motions 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.030
 very slowly and doing a massage a 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.130
 exfoliation on your face are we 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.700
 This mask that I always told 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:00.730
 You and I'm using it, it 's a good time. 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.880
 These days I stopped using it and everything 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.630
 more but I quite like the effect it 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.000
 she gives 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:11.110
 It helps in the pimples so much that I go 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.390
 because I gave her an allergy and she gives 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.400
 again she helped me a lot when I 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.650
 have allergies and had a lot of thorn in her 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.710
 helped me a lot so that's why I 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.720
 I'll make you 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.270
 if you always ask me to do 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.080
 So you're there for my recipe. 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:31.700
 nothing is more than fine rice 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:36.590

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:39.110
 avon lily striations kim and this milk of 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.560
 colony which is one actually a 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.660
 facial cleaning foam can also be 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.960
 a little blue one here is the dark green 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.480
 But there 's blue that's the same thing, I guess. 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.800
