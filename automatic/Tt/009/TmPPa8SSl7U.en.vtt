00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello the whole world of the anses and there 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.910
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 multiplayer of grand theft auto 5 and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.349
 this trick is to get sell 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.930
 cars that are worth more than 50 thousand dollars 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.790
 in previous versions because as 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 you will already know many of the tricks that 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.439
 we have made infinite money and so on 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.149
 because many people what happens to them is 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.610
 they can not sell the vehicle because 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.350
 is worth more than 50 thousand insurance that has 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 past this to many of you true 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.310
 Well, that's because the vehicles that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 you have are old versions 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.680
 previous for example maybe you have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.480
 bought one of in version 1.0 7 and if 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210
 do some trick now or try it 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.540
 sell then maybe it does not leave you I do not know 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.700
 if he's always going to leave us or possibly 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.590
 it's something they've gotten so that they do not 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.020
 you can sell that's why you can only 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.270
 sell the vehicles that are of the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.100
 current version I think the 1.10 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
 they work I do not know if it's true but 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 possibly you can sell them but I 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 I speak of vehicles that you have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 bought in very old versions and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.880
 right now you do not have money to be able 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.649
 do other tricks not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.049
 maybe possibly you have to you 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.759
 you have the garage clogging those 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.909
 vehicles that maybe it say 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 there is no way to remove it unless 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.210
 take a street vehicle the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 substitute for that that's what I've 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 done many times or even others 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.850
 people have also done that because they 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.679
 He has had a remedy to remove it from the garage 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.899
 because you can not sell or you 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.819
 we can remove the insurance is worth a way 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.729
 easiest to do this is to be able to 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:41.039
 sell it by doing a trick first thing 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 more important is to have the garage full 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.420
 in case you do not have it full of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 trick can not be done so I would 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.409
 What I recommend is that you buy a car 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.630
 free good to enter so to speak 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.929
 or if you want the infrabel face as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 You want to have the garage 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.080
 full in case you have it already full 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.819
 so do not worry 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.909
 I in my case have vehicles that do not 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.740
 appear here because they are one before the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.539
 this I did a trick and they are really 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.670
 here what happens that you do not see is worth what 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.069
 I say so you know then what 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.630
 we are going to do is sell the vehicle that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.599
 we want to sell the one that does not leave us in 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.650
 theory in the case this for example 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.390
 imagine that you have another 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.760
 vehicle and you can not sell it 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 we get into our garage in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.860
 our vehicle in which we want 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.780
 sell but you can not then what 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.620
 let's do now is ride on the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.190
 vehicle as I said 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.319
 we give the mobile we go to the internet and 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.170
 we buy a vehicle I recommend it to be 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.330
 one that can be sold because if not yes 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.400
 buy one that is free then 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.810
 will not let sell the other vehicle 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.180
 then we buy the cheapest one that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 it's karim back we bought it and then 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.970
 as I told you we had to have the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.890
 full courage in my case because you are 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.110
 seeing I have it full so we will have to 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.970
 replace a vehicle then what 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.519
 we are going to do is substitute in which 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.320
 we are assembled we replace it and now 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.750
 what you need to do is wait for it 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 when we replace, we have to wait 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.530
 let us know that the street in revel already 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.260
 has come to our garage as soon as 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.390
 leave that message as we see here then 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.489
 what you have to do is start and leave 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.470
 out of the garage because if you do not 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.880
 this is going to lose the vehicle so 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.220
 It is very important that you do this 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 way then when we're out 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.090
 what we will have to do is 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.980
 simply sell the vehicle that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.990
 we have now and when we go to 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.150
 sell it in the saints custom 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.460
 will let you sell the vehicle now that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.920
 we already have money we could buy another 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.960
 vehicle and start with vehicles 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.230
 that are worth less and do the trick of 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.030
 infinite money that we have 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 functional so far and so little to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.880
 little you are getting more and more money 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.830
 until you buy vehicles because 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.980
 worth more not like for example a steel 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.500
 a tourism and already what I recommend that you 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.110
 you get about 5,000,000 or four 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.060
 that you see so that when they leave 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.490
 another patch, so we can sell these 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.650
 vehicles and buy new ones in 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.990
 if you want to always get 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.730
 money not to lose money and well then 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.260
 basically it would be this so good 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.330
 Well, this has been everything if you liked it 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.460

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.440
