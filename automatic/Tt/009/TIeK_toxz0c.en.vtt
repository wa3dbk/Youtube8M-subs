00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610 
so it's very healing and very relaxing
and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.360> add<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> little<00:00:54.840> bit<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> vitamin

and you can add a little bit of vitamin
E<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.149> mix<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:58.140> increase<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> healing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
E to the mix to increase the healing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 
E to the mix to increase the healing
process<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> you've<00:01:00.629> got<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> oil<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.530> these
