00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.270
 what is it and now we'll see 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.330
 how to move the object 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.660
 here on the screen 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.670
 or better in the camera view becomes clearer that it has lost the movements that in the 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.060
 object in the case of suzane can do within this terrestrial environment 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.080
 also in the audience the directional ones if you click English 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.650
 yes looking for eric 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.239
 he will move 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.029
 by the so-called cheese fiction 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.679
 observe 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.940
 portraying the year that will have more ahead ok 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.879
 if you click on this 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.879
 red and it will move on the axis 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 beauty 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 called 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.890
 axis 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170
 the goal critics 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 Just in the square for Bosco corner 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.070
 these are the possible movements 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 the object 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.020
 marking the target areas if you have clear 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 the face is your keyboard 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.310
 See that he points out that he gets to know the whitening. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.140
 exporting next to your mouse 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 coincidentally around the house 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 What do you want so much that even today? 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.460
 after the letter filled for example relevant month and only 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.080
 patients and according to the school 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.500
 if you do the same thing in check followed by elite 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.750
 and then start moving the next day 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 the y-axis 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 it's the same 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.010
 with the event 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.220
 amy upward movement on the landing 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.250
 so if you have several options using your directional arrows 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.630
 carrying the tattoo 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.840
 then 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.480
 of a reading that identifies the doctors if it makes better share 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 green is oy and the going up and down 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.680
 other 20 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.329
 do not forget the pcdob shortcut keys reminds 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.139
 Until I act, it's one of them. 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.120
 now imagine that if you want to give an internal agility 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.339
 Nassar 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.080
 At that time, the face fell. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.469
 our sweet friend 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.469
 small even with air from your keyboard 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.659
 is in the free rotary free rotary 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.979
 twitter did the same thing rehen followed by chile 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.409
 a lie around the cher axis 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.379
 click here not the moment 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 I'll do the same br following the indication 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.339
 moving in the trash of fiction 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.989
 why rv 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.090
 at the moment the line 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.149
 and surroundings 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:51.969
 on axis v 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.680
 then you have to have it as important to know right away the use of the key if the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.339
 east key 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.569
 The letters for the section are obviously defined if you have a 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.599
 control of the movement you want to do 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.039
 none of the objects 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.169
 no this is an important milestone 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.899
 on flat ground and like any other 3d software is interesting because it is 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.189
 work and with 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.209
 with an hour of training and doctors 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.529
 because it will provide you with ease shooting and movements on the screen as per 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.659
 example by a move to go home 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.459
 ie using took off that rolling button that rolls end in the middle of the mouse 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:38.010
 you're going to get close 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.589
 The button 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.589
 central mouse ok took it off 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.539
 called 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.639
 vote at school 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.649
 This is a movement of him to come. 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.379
 enough ahead he comes 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.680
 close behind the rhÃ´ne behind the button 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.549
 do not enter it 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.549
 of State 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.389
 distant 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.799
 a way of 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.959
 You chose June. 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.990
 rita instead of having a minor 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.339
 still identifies that the least 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.379
 using the numeric keypads 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.499
 thus 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.259
 here is not have the options of dunga on the camera at number 0 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:19.189
 topel number 7 frontino targeted on track of a number 3 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.289
 it is important to color these four commands here 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.900
 not all of course it would be too long using shortcut keys 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 Let's try the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.759
 seven product 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.430
 with the proeiro 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.419
 in the top three teams 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.610
 and the 0 to see the bed again realized very easy nÃ© 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.449
 decorating these gates 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.449
 You'll move much faster. 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.330
 it is not advisable to set goals 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.900
 of blender 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 So do not forget the school, back and forth, back and forth. 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.830
 front bion 7 million 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.419
 from the top 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.500
 three eyes 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.710
 from the right side of the sides 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.490
 and in turkey 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.520
 the next tutorial 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.860
 talk a little about 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.030
 is that the size adjustment options and other things else here in our 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.200
