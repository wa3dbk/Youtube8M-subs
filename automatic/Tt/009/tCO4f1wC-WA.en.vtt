00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.320
 hi to all people sign ex 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.360
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.369
 new trick on skyrim 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.630
 so for this trick it is enough that 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.449
 you were going to interpol so loudly 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.859
 various and you will go after 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.970
 to the azure hotel I think it's 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.650
 over there maybe a little bigger 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.480
 way you will see I made the path to 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.410
 foot in the video I leave you there the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.970
 way that I did like that you 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.370
 will see what I 'm doing so 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.800
 this trick is to be able to 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.860
 to make gold without much difficulty 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.960
 and that's how to say 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.400
 this gold you can come back to take 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.400
 progressively, except that it is not 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.199
 the gold you are going to recover it's are 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.180
 books that a van houtte skeleton and to 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.320
 infinity and you can take 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.570
 as much as you want as much as you 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.040
 of your inventory will allow it and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.280
 then come back to resume by the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.869
 after 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.460
 another moment so voili voilou here 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.380
 the path may be quite long so 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.520
 I do not know if I blu ray all the way 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.630
 sequence with my voice but for one 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.890
 will see well also know that on the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.400
 way I met a few small 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.420
 problems 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.260
 as you have you fear you 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.240
 see now if hello you here 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.160
 so I came across some trolls 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.740
 and in addition the voices were completely 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.990
 crazy and so raised the strohl guy who 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.030
 was talking to me about sweet stuff and not dying 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.400
 which I had completely planted in 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 So here I am, I get it 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.080
 recovers his fat 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.100
 I therefore continues it must be you 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.140
 follow the path what it is very 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.340
 important this is where is one 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.409
 kind of hotel actually open up goes to 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.020
 global yes and I also want to soon 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.810
 offer you another tip on 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.330
 skyrim which will consist of increasing 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.820
 your your all that is cured zon 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.970
 destruction one-handed weapons ahmad hand 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 archery all that I believe that even the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.039
 conjuration game not sure but I believe 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.509
 that the conspiracy also read his after 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.400
 it's up to you to invent what you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.110
 can do except against the next 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.599
 video that I would risk you 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.520
 spoiler the quest of the black brotherhood 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.930
 so if you have not done it 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.040
 do it then came back to see my 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.850
 video anyway that i will tell you in 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.380
 video start 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.390
 so if you remember it's not 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 very serious there a second troll that I 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.290
 do more of trout 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.910
 want more watched the takes the pose 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.820
 here you are dead to the kind of skyrim 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.110
 but these bugs and this is bucking of this 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.750
 it's not possible 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.010
 such as the troll who already speak and in addition 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.250
 who talks to me about gifted stuff 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.260
 I have absolutely nothing to fuck these 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.250
 worst last is that after I believe 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840
 that when I go on and the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.510
 skeletons that I have to kill also here he 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.740
 spoke to me so it's good it was the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.890
 eat that was completely buggy then 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.500
 good in the in the last video 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.060
 tips for eloquence she too 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.140
 also it's the same it's on the same 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.610
 session of which everything was buggy 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.500
 also so great so here is the hotel where 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.170
 you have to go there then you 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.600
 will arrive on the main altar the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.560
 wii the skeleton and rent the book 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.450
 gateways 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.680
 they are worth August and this to infinity so the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.970
 principle to make him wake up this 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.260
 that you have to steal something from the hotel 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.250
 you take anything from me 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.630
 wanted to take the purse but hey 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.290
 eat at bugger and I took the bouquet 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.520
 but it's good it's the same yeah here I 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.110
 equip me with my baby because I am 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.790
 were saying in time to try cynical of 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.190
 time I am this level 33-12 machine 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.450
 risk to do me much what and 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.420
 I slider on the intron scholarship 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.790
 book to look for you here I kent you 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.490
 then if you keep him talking not 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.620
 drop and another skeleton game 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.800
 the top and we are well ahead of that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.459
 behind this is what is it is a 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.740
 dish in your mouth 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.020
 so here I doubt the skeletons is good 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.620
 we do not care is because there are 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.940
 more important game twice they have a 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.740
 interesting thing the rue jean had him 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.180
 a rice nest each always good at 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.900
 take 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.370
 I recovered an art one by accident 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.320
 here I go on the skeleton 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.150
 we killed that is raised is him 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.040
 the dig and you see there the doors 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.730
 oblivion on him you take the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.980
 books go back to you hop etc etc etc 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.180
 and that it can last for plants it's 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.859
 for that all the passage that is the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.810
 key well to accelerate good there a little to 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.000
 what a small technical problem 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 yes I kill him but hey that's all that I 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.100
 put them in time I found 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 it would last too long 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.130
 few minutes so you can do 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.529
 his machine is also what I have 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.959
 noticed on the end is that 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.199
 this is a little doubt in con it is 

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:39.089
 that if you open your inventory of 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.439
 of the skeleton that you close and that 

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:41.459
 you turn over it will have two 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.629
 books a place and you can do 

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:47.759
 that to infinity until they have 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.499
 6 7 8 9 22 12 35 is then recovered 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.789
 all of a sudden all that will be done 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.559
 shit to take apparently it comes back 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.579
 the same 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.199
 so you see the value of this book 

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:56.819
 it's 50 so we have to start from the moment 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.869
 where the book makes 50 it means who 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.439
 teaches you something 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:03.119
 so before you sell it read the 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.139
 unless you open it and teach you 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:04.829
 something so I think it was 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.959
 of the conspiracy 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.189
 there I made an ellipse I got 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.289
 found wood arrives to resell everything 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.049
 the brothel world I look at the number of 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.789
 books that I have not recovered 

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:16.469
 badly you can say time you see 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.819
 that teaches you the adjourned conjuration 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.019
 63 so here I sell him first time 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.489
 I invested in these cases because 

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:25.439
 as in the previous two police I 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.449
 you had shown how to ride your 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:32.629
 eloquence level 100 there I take advantage 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:34.769
 so here I sell him all the shit 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:37.289
 so if that does not go much so 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:38.369
 you do that regularly that's it 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.319
 still reports a lot of studies 

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:42.419
 for nothing I believe that the skeletons 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.860
 repop every 48 hours 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.719
 so that's always good to take 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.269
 is what I made in 2000 some 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.429
 piece thing we are that's it so 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.709
 these are the people I tell you to the 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.589
 next it was nex and I hope that 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.479
 this video tips will have pleased you and that 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.279
 the next one too so here I am reading 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.579
 all kisses people to the next 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.579
 ciao
