the power of two people put together he
could<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.030> trained<00:02:27.330> under<00:02:27.569> bills<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.170> then

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
could have trained under bills and then

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.800 
could have trained under bills and then
you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.430> he<00:02:29.760> didn't<00:02:30.000> reach<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.239> god<00:02:30.390> level

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810

you know not he didn't reach a god level
but<00:02:31.319> he<00:02:31.470> got<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> certain<00:02:32.069> point<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.879> made

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
but he got to a certain point that made

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.000 
but he got to a certain point that made
him<00:02:33.480> seem<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> fusion<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:34.709> different

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
him seem like a fusion of two different

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.610 
him seem like a fusion of two different
people<00:02:35.540> well<00:02:36.540> he<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> fusion<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.470> two

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
people well he is a fusion of two

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.100 
people well he is a fusion of two
different<00:02:37.860> people<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.459> his<00:02:39.150> powers<00:02:39.569> his

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
different people and his powers his

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.470 
different people and his powers his
powers<00:02:40.470> multiplied<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.129> not<00:02:41.310> added<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.239> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
powers multiplied it's not added on so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.830 
powers multiplied it's not added on so
it's<00:02:43.019> like<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.830> metamorph<00:02:44.370> Eugen<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.330> adds

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
it's like the metamorph Eugen just adds

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
it's like the metamorph Eugen just adds
your<00:02:46.110> power<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:46.980> additionally<00:02:47.519> where

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
your power you know additionally where

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.009 
your power you know additionally where
as<00:02:47.790> opposed<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.329> pitar<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.690> just

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
as opposed to the pitar I just

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.470 
as opposed to the pitar I just
multiplies<00:02:49.560> your<00:02:49.769> power<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.269> terms

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
multiplies your power so like in terms

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.479 
multiplies your power so like in terms
of<00:02:51.660> mathematics<00:02:52.260> statistics<00:02:52.380> Vegeta<00:02:53.310> would

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
of mathematics statistics Vegeta would

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.309 
of mathematics statistics Vegeta would
still<00:02:53.700> be<00:02:53.790> more<00:02:53.910> powerful<00:02:54.239> than<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:55.200> know

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319

the chichi does have two kids instead of
just<00:03:11.670> one<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.390> trained<00:03:12.750> Brian<00:03:13.319> Penn<00:03:13.590> so

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
just one it trained Brian Penn so

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.220 
just one it trained Brian Penn so
there's<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.790> not<00:03:15.060> even<00:03:15.390> count<00:03:15.569> as<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:15.930> him<00:03:16.079> I

mean he was still being there for both
families<00:03:18.569> as<00:03:18.690> much<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.319> was<00:03:19.410> hard<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.859> him

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
families as much as it was hard for him

he even admitted like hey I can't
separate<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.010> I'll<00:03:23.609> contribute

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
separate this is it so I'll contribute

separate this is it so I'll contribute
by<00:03:24.389> being<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.650> father<00:03:25.889> of<00:03:26.040> both

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
by being you know the father of both

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.970 
by being you know the father of both
families<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.000> either<00:03:27.389> way<00:03:27.750> he<00:03:27.930> took<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.230> two

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
families but either way he took the two

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.400 
families but either way he took the two
of<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> two<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.299> women<00:03:30.569> under<00:03:31.260> his

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
of the two of the the women under his

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.740 
of the two of the the women under his
wing<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.829> they<00:03:32.250> became<00:03:32.519> Super<00:03:32.940> Saiyans<00:03:33.299> very

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
wing and they became Super Saiyans very

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.059 
wing and they became Super Saiyans very
very<00:03:33.930> fast<00:03:34.200> because<00:03:34.380> he<00:03:34.620> trained<00:03:34.859> them<00:03:34.950> like

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
very fast because he trained them like

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.150 
very fast because he trained them like
beasts<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.940> mean<00:03:36.709> what<00:03:37.709> was<00:03:37.799> your<00:03:37.859> take<00:03:38.040> on

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
beasts so I mean what was your take on

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.930 
beasts so I mean what was your take on
that<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.549> having<00:03:38.730> having<00:03:39.239> him<00:03:39.389> be<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.599> teacher

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
that like having having him be a teacher

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.129 
that like having having him be a teacher
I<00:03:41.940> was<00:03:42.540> thinking<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:44.239> him<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.389> train<00:03:45.690> two

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
I was thinking that for him to train two

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.110 
I was thinking that for him to train two
different<00:03:46.470> people<00:03:46.590> or<00:03:46.709> two<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.280> his<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:48.090> of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
different people or two of his one of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.210 
different people or two of his one of
his<00:03:48.209> one<00:03:48.450> being<00:03:48.660> his<00:03:48.780> kid<00:03:48.989> one<00:03:49.380> being<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
his one being his kid one being like I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890 
his one being his kid one being like I
guess<00:03:50.849> they're<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.060> don't<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.389> how<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.660> put

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
guess they're I don't know how to put

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.180 
guess they're I don't know how to put
this<00:03:52.049> but<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:54.230> felt<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:55.799> they<00:03:55.919> trained

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
this but I felt like if they trained

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.530 
this but I felt like if they trained
under<00:03:56.430> him<00:03:56.459> would<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.970> make<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.329> would

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
under him would that make that would

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.449 
under him would that make that would
that<00:03:57.690> make<00:03:57.870> them<00:03:58.079> like<00:03:58.349> get<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.069> his<00:03:59.220> power

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
that make them like get to his power

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.400 
that make them like get to his power
level<00:03:59.819> oh<00:03:59.940> no<00:04:00.329> absolutely<00:04:00.840> not<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
level oh no absolutely not but that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.319 
level oh no absolutely not but that
would<00:04:01.530> make<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.919> mean<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> way<00:04:02.489> he<00:04:02.700> would<00:04:02.790> push

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
would make I mean the way he would push

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.420 
would make I mean the way he would push
you<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.690> train<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.019> would<00:04:04.290> be<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.680> lot<00:04:05.220> more

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you and train you would be a lot more

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.650 
you and train you would be a lot more
intense<00:04:05.790> than<00:04:05.910> anybody<00:04:06.239> else<00:04:06.480> because

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
intense than anybody else because

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.599 
intense than anybody else because
remember<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.650> let's<00:04:07.859> say<00:04:08.010> if<00:04:08.040> Goku<00:04:08.489> were<00:04:08.549> to

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
remember like let's say if Goku were to

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.339 
remember like let's say if Goku were to
punch<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.030> face<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.450> would<00:04:09.540> hurt<00:04:09.720> but

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
punch you in the face it would hurt but

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.330 
punch you in the face it would hurt but
let's<00:04:10.500> say<00:04:10.620> if<00:04:10.709> he<00:04:10.829> would<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.010> punch<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
let's say if he would have punch you in

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.530 
let's say if he would have punch you in
the<00:04:11.400> face<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.760> would<00:04:11.819> hurt<00:04:12.000> twice<00:04:12.209> as<00:04:12.359> much

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
the face it would hurt twice as much

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.199 
the face it would hurt twice as much
because<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.250> power<00:04:14.430> multiplier<00:04:14.970> it's

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
because the the power multiplier it's

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.229 
because the the power multiplier it's
just<00:04:15.480> like<00:04:16.010> it's<00:04:17.010> like<00:04:17.220> double<00:04:17.579> goku<00:04:17.880> strength

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
just like it's like double goku strength

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.870 
just like it's like double goku strength
so<00:04:18.359> it's<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.599> whatever<00:04:19.049> happens<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:19.650> like

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
so it's like whatever happens it's like

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.969 
so it's like whatever happens it's like
vegeto<00:04:20.880> hits<00:04:21.120> harder<00:04:21.510> he's<00:04:21.690> faster<00:04:22.260> he's<00:04:22.740> more

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
vegeto hits harder he's faster he's more

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.120 
vegeto hits harder he's faster he's more
durable<00:04:23.400> he's<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:23.789> agile<00:04:24.210> he's<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.539> like

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
durable he's more agile he's more like

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.560 
durable he's more agile he's more like
he's<00:04:26.130> more<00:04:26.370> strategic<00:04:26.880> so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
he's more strategic so

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.530 
he's more strategic so
it's<00:04:28.320> just<00:04:28.500> like<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.340> think<00:04:29.820> they<00:04:30.060> would<00:04:30.300> I

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
it's just like I I think they would I

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.180 
it's just like I I think they would I
think<00:04:30.960> those<00:04:31.080> two<00:04:31.290> girls<00:04:31.530> would<00:04:31.650> end<00:04:31.830> up<00:04:31.950> being

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
think those two girls would end up being

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.910 
think those two girls would end up being
very<00:04:32.540> powerful<00:04:33.540> warriors<00:04:34.140> because<00:04:34.440> having<00:04:34.710> to

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
very powerful warriors because having to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.060 
very powerful warriors because having to
train<00:04:35.160> under<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.790> hybrid<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:37.620> it's

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
train under a hybrid is just it's

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.320 
train under a hybrid is just it's
incredible<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.580> mean<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:38.940> had<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> option

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
incredible I mean if you had the option

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.240 
incredible I mean if you had the option
of<00:04:39.630> training<00:04:39.960> with<00:04:40.080> Vegeta<00:04:40.470> Goku<00:04:40.980> or<00:04:41.160> Vegeta

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
of training with Vegeta Goku or Vegeta

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010 
of training with Vegeta Goku or Vegeta
who<00:04:41.910> would<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.090> go<00:04:42.210> with<00:04:42.330> you'd<00:04:42.690> go<00:04:42.810> with<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
who would you go with you'd go with the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.830 
who would you go with you'd go with the
obvious<00:04:43.140> of<00:04:43.530> course<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.880> if<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.330> store<00:04:45.630> was

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
obvious of course so if this store was

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.260 
obvious of course so if this store was
up<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.380> would<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:46.890> rather<00:04:47.070> make<00:04:47.700> vegeto

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
up to you would you rather make vegeto

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.650 
up to you would you rather make vegeto
his<00:04:48.510> own<00:04:48.630> person<00:04:49.110> like<00:04:49.700> yeah<00:04:50.700> cuz<00:04:51.000> then<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.570> I

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
his own person like yeah cuz then then I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.330 
his own person like yeah cuz then then I
would<00:04:51.810> love<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.110> see<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.950> age-old<00:04:53.310> question

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
would love to see the age-old question

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180 
would love to see the age-old question
of<00:04:53.940> Gogeta<00:04:54.630> versus<00:04:55.020> vegeto<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.160> I

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
of Gogeta versus vegeto is that that I

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.160 
of Gogeta versus vegeto is that that I
mean<00:04:56.340> there's<00:04:57.240> no<00:04:57.360> way<00:04:57.510> we<00:04:57.660> can<00:04:57.780> see<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.020> now

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
mean there's no way we can see it now

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.500 
mean there's no way we can see it now
because<00:04:58.560> they're<00:04:59.430> all<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.760> same<00:04:59.790> person<00:05:00.180> so

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
because they're all the same person so

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.030 
because they're all the same person so
how<00:05:00.840> would<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:00.990> even<00:05:01.230> come<00:05:01.350> about<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:01.770> if

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
how would that even come about but if

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.850 
how would that even come about but if
Gina<00:05:02.910> was<00:05:03.030> his<00:05:03.180> own<00:05:03.270> character<00:05:03.570> then<00:05:03.870> yeah<00:05:04.050> but

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
Gina was his own character then yeah but

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.860 
Gina was his own character then yeah but
if<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.670> was<00:05:05.760> up<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:05.880> me<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:07.640> well<00:05:08.640> let's<00:05:09.480> say<00:05:09.660> that

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
if it was up to me I well let's say that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.170 
if it was up to me I well let's say that
would<00:05:09.990> have<00:05:10.110> happened<00:05:10.290> um<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.550> would<00:05:11.880> stick

would have happened um I would stick
with<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.420> story<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:12.990> I<00:05:13.050> would<00:05:13.290> not<00:05:13.470> allow

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
with that story but I would not allow

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.430 
with that story but I would not allow
vegeto<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.670> kill<00:05:14.910> Buu<00:05:15.150> off<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.690> easy<00:05:15.990> like<00:05:16.260> he

be gone knows it um I would stick with
the<00:05:22.410> formula<00:05:22.950> but<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.220> would<00:05:23.430> have<00:05:23.550> beers<00:05:23.910> being

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the formula but I would have beers being

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.120 
the formula but I would have beers being
like<00:05:24.780> reintroduced<00:05:25.350> like<00:05:25.710> towards<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.040> end

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
like reintroduced like towards the end

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.190 
like reintroduced like towards the end
after<00:05:26.970> he's<00:05:27.090> done<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:27.570> know<00:05:27.660> being<00:05:27.900> a<00:05:27.990> teacher

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
after he's done you know being a teacher

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.960 
after he's done you know being a teacher
or<00:05:28.380> whatnot<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.830> then<00:05:29.190> have<00:05:29.370> his<00:05:29.490> power<00:05:29.730> put

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
or whatnot and then have his power put

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.490 
or whatnot and then have his power put
to<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> test<00:05:30.270> because<00:05:30.600> he<00:05:30.780> never<00:05:31.080> really<00:05:31.200> had

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
to the test because he never really had

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.700 
to the test because he never really had
his<00:05:31.590> power<00:05:31.860> put<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> test<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:33.560> mean<00:05:34.560> only

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
his power put to the test I mean only

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.440 
his power put to the test I mean only
the<00:05:35.070> Keio<00:05:35.280> shouldn't<00:05:35.670> know<00:05:35.730> how<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:35.940> separate

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
the Keio shouldn't know how to separate

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.330 
the Keio shouldn't know how to separate
if<00:05:36.690> that's<00:05:37.230> even<00:05:37.410> possible<00:05:37.560> but<00:05:38.160> what

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
if that's even possible but what

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.560 
if that's even possible but what
wouldn't<00:05:38.550> what<00:05:38.880> I've<00:05:39.030> never<00:05:39.300> really

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
wouldn't what I've never really

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.940 
wouldn't what I've never really
understood<00:05:39.960> was<00:05:40.110> how<00:05:40.260> he<00:05:40.320> was<00:05:40.590> able<00:05:40.740> to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
understood was how he was able to

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.190 
understood was how he was able to
separate<00:05:41.400> in<00:05:41.580> booze<00:05:42.120> by<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.600> begin<00:05:42.720> with

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
separate in booze by it to begin with

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.870 
separate in booze by it to begin with
that's<00:05:43.560> why<00:05:43.770> this<00:05:43.830> story<00:05:44.310> made<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:44.700> much<00:05:44.820> sense

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
that's why this story made so much sense

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.380 
that's why this story made so much sense
because<00:05:45.240> in<00:05:46.230> the<00:05:46.890> actual<00:05:47.250> TV<00:05:47.430> show<00:05:47.760> they<00:05:48.000> never

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
because in the actual TV show they never

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.140 
because in the actual TV show they never
ever<00:05:48.780> ever<00:05:49.350> explained<00:05:50.070> why<00:05:50.460> they<00:05:50.640> separated

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
ever ever explained why they separated

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.750 
ever ever explained why they separated
ever<00:05:51.450> like<00:05:52.200> all<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.650> all<00:05:52.770> Vegeta<00:05:53.400> said<00:05:53.610> was

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
ever like all that all Vegeta said was

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.240 
ever like all that all Vegeta said was
oh<00:05:54.350> we're<00:05:55.350> back<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.800> normal<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.190> that

that<00:06:37.140> way<00:06:37.350> no<00:06:38.040> III<00:06:38.580> think<00:06:39.240> if<00:06:39.360> he<00:06:39.510> was<00:06:39.690> his<00:06:39.990> own

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
that way no III think if he was his own

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.600 
that way no III think if he was his own
person

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
person

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.890 
person
I<00:06:40.639> don't<00:06:40.789> think<00:06:40.819> as<00:06:41.150> many<00:06:41.389> people<00:06:41.689> would<00:06:41.810> have

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
I don't think as many people would have

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.929 
I don't think as many people would have
gotten<00:06:42.050> absorbed<00:06:42.620> like<00:06:42.949> I<00:06:43.009> don't<00:06:43.159> think<00:06:43.340> if<00:06:43.610> he

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
gotten absorbed like I don't think if he

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.999 
gotten absorbed like I don't think if he
were<00:06:44.060> to<00:06:44.210> say<00:06:44.240> he<00:06:44.930> assisted<00:06:45.349> Johan<00:06:45.740> or

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:46.009 
were to say he assisted Johan or

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:46.450 
were to say he assisted Johan or
something

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
something

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.730 
something
ultimately<00:06:46.879> Gohan<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.389> don't<00:06:47.870> think<00:06:48.080> that<00:06:48.319> the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
ultimately Gohan I don't think that the

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.439 
ultimately Gohan I don't think that the
Gohan<00:06:49.039> what<00:06:49.159> had<00:06:49.250> gotten<00:06:49.400> absorbed<00:06:49.939> if<00:06:50.180> the

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
Gohan what had gotten absorbed if the

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.659 
Gohan what had gotten absorbed if the
GTO<00:06:50.780> was<00:06:50.960> there<00:06:51.169> to<00:06:51.289> help<00:06:51.409> him<00:06:51.680> if<00:06:52.099> he<00:06:52.250> had

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
GTO was there to help him if he had

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.730 
GTO was there to help him if he had
volunteered<00:06:53.240> to<00:06:53.659> do<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:54.020> if<00:06:54.289> he<00:06:54.379> was<00:06:54.500> his<00:06:54.620> own

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
volunteered to do that if he was his own

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.890 
volunteered to do that if he was his own
character<00:06:55.090> absolutely<00:06:56.090> not<00:06:56.240> because<00:06:56.419> Vegeta

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
character absolutely not because Vegeta

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.119 
character absolutely not because Vegeta
would<00:06:57.110> have<00:06:57.199> stopped<00:06:57.439> him<00:06:57.560> before<00:06:57.949> he<00:06:58.099> even

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
would have stopped him before he even

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.429 
would have stopped him before he even
had<00:06:58.729> the<00:06:58.939> chance<00:06:58.969> to<00:06:59.360> absorb<00:06:59.629> anyone<00:07:00.020> but<00:07:00.229> I
