00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's basically it ok so the next

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's basically it ok so the next
question<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> worst<00:01:31.110> thing<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
question is what is the worst thing and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.270 
question is what is the worst thing and
what<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.790> make<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.090> okay<00:01:33.720> um<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
what do you do to make it okay um the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.960 
what do you do to make it okay um the
worst<00:01:35.520> thing<00:01:36.590> would<00:01:37.700> probably<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:40.970> was

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
worst thing would probably be I was

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.280 
worst thing would probably be I was
going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> say<00:01:42.299> video<00:01:42.479> ideas<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.140> I've

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
going to say video ideas but I've

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
going to say video ideas but I've
actually<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> pretty<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:44.369> video<00:01:44.729> ideas

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
actually got a pretty good video ideas

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
actually got a pretty good video ideas
um<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> probably<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.990> making<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.619> make

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
