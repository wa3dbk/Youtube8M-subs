there's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> red<00:02:39.200> green<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.640> blue<00:02:42.140> then<00:02:43.140> let's

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
there's a red green and blue then let's

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.720 
there's a red green and blue then let's
say<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> want<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> lighter<00:02:43.950> blue<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.459> can

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
say you want a lighter blue I can

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.580 
say you want a lighter blue I can
actually<00:02:45.030> turn<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.390> down<00:02:45.660> shade<00:02:46.080> by<00:02:46.290> saying

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
actually turn it down shade by saying

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.470 
actually turn it down shade by saying
and<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.250> hope<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.610> video<00:02:47.849> cameras<00:02:48.300> showing

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and I hope the video cameras showing

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.180 
and I hope the video cameras showing
that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.000 
that
gradually<00:02:49.790> decreasing<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.050> same<00:02:51.680> thing<00:02:51.860> with

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
gradually decreasing it same thing with

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.490 
gradually decreasing it same thing with
green<00:02:54.400> can<00:02:55.400> turn<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.700> into<00:02:55.850> blues<00:02:56.090> again<00:02:56.500> Red's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
green can turn it into blues again Red's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.680 
green can turn it into blues again Red's
I<00:02:57.620> can<00:02:57.800> feel<00:02:58.100> something<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.490> little<00:02:59.150> bit<00:02:59.270> darker

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I can feel something a little bit darker

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.860 
I can feel something a little bit darker
and<00:02:59.870> lighter<00:03:00.110> oranges<00:03:01.390> all<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.510> way<00:03:02.600> into<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
and lighter oranges all the way into the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.690 
and lighter oranges all the way into the
different<00:03:03.200> shades<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.620> yellows<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.580> have

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
different shades of yellows so you have

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.050 
different shades of yellows so you have
a<00:03:07.820> brightness<00:03:08.210> control<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:10.490> can<00:03:10.640> turn<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.940> up

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
a brightness control you can turn it up

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.530 
a brightness control you can turn it up
and<00:03:11.240> down<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:12.070> also<00:03:13.070> have<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> fun<00:03:13.640> fading

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
and down you also have the fun fading

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.220 
and down you also have the fun fading
patterns<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.500> three<00:03:15.710> color<00:03:15.950> jump

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
patterns you have the three color jump

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.920 
patterns you have the three color jump
you<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.500> seven<00:03:19.340> color<00:03:19.520> jump<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.780> if

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
you have the seven color jump and if

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.810 
you have the seven color jump and if
that's<00:03:21.050> jumping<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.620> little<00:03:21.710> too<00:03:21.950> quickly<00:03:22.160> you

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
that's jumping a little too quickly you

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.370 
that's jumping a little too quickly you
can<00:03:22.970> use<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.240> peak<00:03:23.510> control<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.080> turn<00:03:24.230> it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
can use this peak control to turn it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.720 
can use this peak control to turn it
down<00:03:24.410> just<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.860> notch<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:28.460> three<00:03:28.610> color

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
down just a notch you have three color

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.950 
down just a notch you have three color
fade<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.590> semi<00:03:33.830> color<00:03:34.070> baby<00:03:34.720> then<00:03:35.720> again

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
fade and a semi color baby then again

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.420 
fade and a semi color baby then again
you<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.200> still<00:03:36.410> use<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.680> speed<00:03:36.920> control<00:03:37.310> to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
you can still use that speed control to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.690 
you can still use that speed control to
adjust<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.000> can<00:03:38.150> make<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:38.900> faster<00:03:39.700> or

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
adjust it you can make it faster or

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.240 
adjust it you can make it faster or
slower<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:41.330> suit<00:03:41.510> your<00:03:41.660> needs

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
slower to suit your needs

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.140 
slower to suit your needs
let's<00:03:43.250> think<00:03:43.430> I'm<00:03:43.550> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> show<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
let's think I'm going to show you is you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150 
let's think I'm going to show you is you
have<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.330> DIY<00:03:44.660> function<00:03:45.440> which<00:03:45.800> basically

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
have a DIY function which basically

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.030 
have a DIY function which basically
allows<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.270> fine-tune<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.990> code<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.800> for

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
allows you to fine-tune the code so for

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.530 
allows you to fine-tune the code so for
example<00:03:49.520> let's<00:03:49.790> say<00:03:49.910> you're<00:03:50.030> using<00:03:50.060> these<00:03:50.390> in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
example let's say you're using these in

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.460 
example let's say you're using these in
a<00:03:50.600> wedding<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.690> although<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.870> do<00:03:54.110> have<00:03:54.140> this

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
a wedding and although you do have this

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.680 
a wedding and although you do have this
great<00:03:54.709> shade<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.340> yellow<00:03:55.489> here<00:03:55.850> let's<00:03:56.510> say

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
great shade of yellow here let's say

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.250 
great shade of yellow here let's say
that<00:03:56.750> you're<00:03:57.320> your<00:03:58.250> bride<00:03:58.700> says<00:03:59.150> no<00:03:59.390> no<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.780> want

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
that you're your bride says no no I want

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.630 
that you're your bride says no no I want
that<00:04:00.290> shade<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.770> be<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.890> little<00:04:01.100> bit<00:04:01.220> different

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
that shade to be a little bit different

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640 
that shade to be a little bit different
Barbara<00:04:02.060> broader<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:02.959> what<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.200> do<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.530> go

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
Barbara broader so what you do is you go

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.699 
Barbara broader so what you do is you go
to<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.920> DIY<00:04:04.370> function<00:04:04.820> here<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.530> can

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
to the DIY function here and you can

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.210 
to the DIY function here and you can
individually<00:04:07.010> adjust<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.560> values<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:13.070> where

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
individually adjust the values to where

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.860 
individually adjust the values to where
you<00:04:13.340> want<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.060> hope<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.390> can<00:04:14.540> tell<00:04:14.750> what

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
you want and I hope you can tell what

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870 
you want and I hope you can tell what
I'm<00:04:14.959> doing<00:04:15.230> here<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.950> vo<00:04:16.130> camera<00:04:16.549> may<00:04:16.669> not

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
I'm doing here the the vo camera may not

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.090 
I'm doing here the the vo camera may not
show<00:04:17.120> every<00:04:18.019> little<00:04:18.260> adjustment<00:04:18.739> very<00:04:18.919> well

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
show every little adjustment very well

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.000 
show every little adjustment very well
but<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.549> couldn't<00:04:20.120> really<00:04:20.209> see<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.570> shades

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
but I couldn't really see the shades

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.870 
but I couldn't really see the shades
turning<00:04:22.010> here<00:04:22.190> I'm<00:04:22.340> trying<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.610> go<00:04:22.700> really

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
turning here I'm trying to go really

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.650 
turning here I'm trying to go really
fast<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.419> can<00:04:23.570> tell<00:04:24.940> but<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.030> think<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
fast you can tell but I think just the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.570 
fast you can tell but I think just the
blue<00:04:26.840> green<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.470> red<00:04:27.530> values<00:04:28.010> independently

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
blue green and red values independently

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.560 
blue green and red values independently
there's<00:04:29.390> also<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.720> strobe<00:04:30.410> feature<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:32.450> can

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
there's also a strobe feature you can

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.010 
there's also a strobe feature you can
turn<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.900> up<00:04:33.640> turn<00:04:34.640> it<00:04:34.700> down<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.690> will<00:04:35.840> really

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
turn it up turn it down that will really

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.790 
turn it up turn it down that will really
get<00:04:36.200> your<00:04:36.380> attention

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
get your attention

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040 
get your attention
aside<00:04:37.370> from<00:04:37.550> being<00:04:37.700> very<00:04:37.880> durable<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.570> mean

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
aside from being very durable I mean

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.130 
aside from being very durable I mean
it's<00:04:39.260> very<00:04:39.320> easy<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:40.250> lift<00:04:40.690> you're<00:04:41.690> looking<00:04:41.990> at

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
it's very easy to lift you're looking at

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.290 
it's very easy to lift you're looking at
exactly<00:04:42.890> 35<00:04:43.400> pounds<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.030> unit<00:04:44.210> without

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
exactly 35 pounds for the unit without
