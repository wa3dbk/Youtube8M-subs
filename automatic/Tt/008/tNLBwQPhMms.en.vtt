00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.650

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.470
 peru do not be afraid because it is not 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.230
 I still think it's one of the things 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.699
 who most intimidated me to make turkey 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.039
 who thought it was very difficult but it is 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.869
 super easy very good very quickly 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.630
 the oven will do all the work that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.850
 you 'll just temper and exchange 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.579
 It's wonderful, I have here a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.010
 cup of softened butter must be 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.050
 a line for you to destroy place which 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.660
 Wait a minute, give me a break. 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.020
 and we will temper it to make a 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.000
 herbal butter this is what this 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.149
 will leave our turkey very golden 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.289

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.989

 only stay up you do not need 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.110
 necessarily use the generic cast 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.070
 You can use this one you want to dispute. 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.830
 alone 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.690
 The dill is very tasty too. 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.510

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.090

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.960
 generous amount of salt than because 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.380
 the turkey is not 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.790

 but how much can you help brother you? 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.180
 I prefer to put a little animal 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 together and I'll just mix I think 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.520
 not that we'll put it in turkey 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.450

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.100

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.340
 She's the first one that I like then. 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:04.600
 always involves putting down 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:06.820
 of the previous one and so it will not stay 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.950

 There you go and smell better perfume 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.750

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.570

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.820

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.680
 Cookie with what's left over in cinnamon 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.050

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:46.050
 that the lemon is one squeezed in the lemon 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:51.450
