would do with the killstreaks is add two
more<00:02:17.830> flares<00:02:18.220> every<00:02:18.459> killstreak<00:02:19.020> attack

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.220 
helicopters you can shoot them down
before<00:02:21.520> they<00:02:21.670> even<00:02:21.850> get<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.090> shot<00:02:22.330> off<00:02:22.390> pave

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230

lows<00:02:23.440> are<00:02:23.590> two<00:02:23.800> stinger<00:02:24.130> shot<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.910> make

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
lows are two stinger shot then you make

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.390 
lows are two stinger shot then you make
it<00:02:25.180> more<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.569> AC<00:02:25.720> AC<00:02:26.380> 130<00:02:26.920> where<00:02:27.310> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
it more like the AC AC 130 where it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.030 
it more like the AC AC 130 where it
takes<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:28.480> couple<00:02:28.630> people<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.709> shoot<00:02:29.890> down

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
takes like a couple people to shoot down

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.970 
takes like a couple people to shoot down
and<00:02:30.370> kill<00:02:30.850> streak<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.470> other<00:02:32.470> than<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.709> so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
and kill streak but other than that so

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.590 
and kill streak but other than that so
you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> see<00:02:33.370> their<00:02:33.550> whole<00:02:33.730> team<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:34.060> aiming

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you can see their whole team is aiming

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.800 
you can see their whole team is aiming
down<00:02:34.690> even<00:02:35.020> level<00:02:35.290> 30s<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.820> just<00:02:37.540> hope<00:02:37.660> they

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
down even level 30s and I just hope they

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.479 
down even level 30s and I just hope they
had<00:02:37.900> some<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.140> flares<00:02:38.530> or<00:02:38.740> something<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.310> see

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
had some more flares or something to see

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.640 
had some more flares or something to see
my<00:02:39.700> people<00:02:40.180> already<00:02:40.330> got<00:02:40.510> shot<00:02:40.690> down<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.110> one

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
my people already got shot down but one

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.050 
my people already got shot down but one
person<00:02:41.830> can<00:02:42.130> take<00:02:42.250> out<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> pavelow<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.880> 10

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
person can take out a pavelow in 10

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
person can take out a pavelow in 10
seconds<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.830> wish<00:02:45.010> they<00:02:45.130> would

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
seconds so I just wish they would

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.440 
seconds so I just wish they would
increase<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.580> flares<00:02:45.910> or<00:02:46.060> make<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.330> more

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
increase the flares or make it more

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.540 
increase the flares or make it more
difficult<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.989> shoot<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.220> should<00:02:48.430> be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
difficult to shoot down but it should be

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.150 
difficult to shoot down but it should be
a<00:02:48.580> team<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> team-based<00:02:50.590> thing<00:02:50.890> where

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
a team it like a team-based thing where

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.320 
a team it like a team-based thing where
you<00:02:51.250> have<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.519> shoot<00:02:51.640> down<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> kill<00:02:52.030> streak<00:02:52.120> but

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
you have to shoot down a kill streak but

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.660 
you have to shoot down a kill streak but
that's<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.600> my<00:02:52.780> opinion<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.519> anyways<00:02:54.519> back

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670
