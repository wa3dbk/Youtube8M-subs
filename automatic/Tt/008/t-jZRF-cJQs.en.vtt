that's<00:02:08.910> why<00:02:09.030> i<00:02:09.060> say<00:02:09.300> shakes<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> messiah

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that's why i say shakes is not a messiah

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
that's why i say shakes is not a messiah
and<00:02:10.500> he<00:02:10.800> needs<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> face<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> music<00:02:11.520> if<00:02:11.879> we

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and he needs to face the music if we

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
and he needs to face the music if we
fail<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.300> qualify<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.900> next<00:02:13.020> round
