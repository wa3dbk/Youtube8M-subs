 windows 98 to windows 7 exclusive 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.840
 windows nt but it would have to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.450
 actually synonymous easily buy and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.559
 taxi budget is a software for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.460
 create midi files or kita pro 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.399
 tabs i do not just use this file 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 so to play a bit around for fun 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
 I had tried these programs there 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 I had no idea of â€‹â€‹anywhere 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.000
 Victory I once had as a small recorder 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.780
 but played it years ago 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.750
 Now I've got a guitar 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 and for that you have to say that also for 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.840
 beginners well suited but see you 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.439
 Just have a look 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 This is a freeware for free 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.009
 disposal link to download I will 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.460
 as always in the video description 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.640
 put 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 and now do not first go straight times 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 with a self-composed song of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 me with the very imaginative title 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 my song not because of its tip but 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.369
 No other name came to mind with me 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.710
 is when you start the program the first time 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 opens the user interface looks like this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 you have your lines where you are from 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.750
 play his notes on it or on it 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.729
 can set and only times only a clock to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.000
 Add another tact to the one here 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.880
 just start up and start up 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.600
 then how many, for example 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.340
 new round part stays then one has one 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.570
 set of instruments you open 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.319
 can be done by just double clicking 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.319
 on the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.139
 Go away then you can get out of here 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.560
 has a lot of thoughts 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:31.629
 then you better have cellos and july 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:38.120
 possible huber piano and so what 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:40.459
 Organize the and of course edith at what 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.200
 Also nice is then you can here 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.299
 give track a name, for example 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.000
 first guitar and then you can go here 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.379
 to insert his notes when you go to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120
 example , the quarter wants to have a note 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.069
 then you have to give the first note and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.780
 then you can change it up here because 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.040
 That's a negative note at all 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.319
 refers or 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 then on the note down here in the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.040
 guitar riffs tabs no idea right now 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.549
 is provided if I click here now 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.689
 and do one or two then I can 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.639
 make an absolute out of it here and 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:23.569
 here too cold there for example 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:25.129
 now make a 64 00 de and tip so 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.659
 First an important tip if you have one 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.000
 I wanted to insert a drumset now 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.299
 times meant how to be 19 adds one 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.939
 go on track add on track 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.530
 opens a fold a new track in 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.400
 the standard settings he is called only 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.979
 crack 2 takes it a normal stole his 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.209
 guitar 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.870
 if you make drums out there 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.759
 want or any others 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.530
 musical instruments you with somehow 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:55.340
 are to drum on it or too 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:00.530
 then click on it and click on it 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.430
 you go down to pre pussys position 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.489
 no idea how trace please with that 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:13.329
 ok, you have to look and tricks 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.829
 here are the whole instruments 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.829
 and drummed immortal then you can 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.889
 here as soon as you put the then 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.620
 his length of takkt 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.379
 eight dead and then one can also ne 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.550
 Triangle has beautiful 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:36.219
 if that's what you see here then 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.199
 Of course, this is not the case 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.419
 that one on a guitar 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.689
 can reenact it is also possible to nix 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.969
 give in where you drumming 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:48.550
 and I say now times that you just have to 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.409
 one can only use matrix menu if 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.110
 I have a finished song I hope 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:57.069
 now that's just that 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.419
 used files no then you can 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:02.919
 here is guitar or bass if you want 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.080
 here are still many only five pages 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.810
 has stopped depending on what you did 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.279
 you can take care of this symbol here 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.699
 that 's everyone on it tychy perren 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.139
 fingerboard only fingerboard then you can 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.939
 View here where you can 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.379
 For example, a guitar has to grab a guitar 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:22.779
 here on the side with the 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:28.419
 second half of the page is from behind 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:30.430
 from the beginning of October the whole 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:37.750
 It will then be tense 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:40.449
 the first would be the second clock onto 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.379
 the guitar and then you can get here 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.360
 show where to grab 1 10 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.889
 000 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.819
 I can now sample myself once 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:56.229
 give of my song and runs in parallel 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:58.860
 then here below the indication where you 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.860
 must grab 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.640
 so i think that should be enough here 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.870
 For example, we are here today 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.380
 several instruments in it 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.180
 the pass is not yet second electronic 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.470
 guitar and drums 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.710
 yes, and if you can do it all now 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.420
 you just want to export 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.640
 file and export to 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:41.600
 then you go on like so on 1 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.760
 media format then what about a media 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.510
 center is so it can be called again 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.250
 But it can be synonymous in the new movie 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.900
 in the new media player of windows 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.430
 again I do not give now know as 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.700
 with apple because I am we are unfortunately 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.340
 no apple, yes, still an important thing 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.160
 if you have something to do then 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.510
 theme tutorials intro moderately makes eighth 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.670
 that the pace is right 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.330
 what is set is what to do 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:11.900
 just then on composition and on 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.780
 pace when you are here is a coupe 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.160
 Just once by default 120 if 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.210
 it too slowly dying halt 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.950
 faster until you like it and 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.300
 then just export it and then 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.440
 you can use that for his 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.550
 tutorials as intro and that would be it 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.400
 actually already been 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.440
 to this program tux kita I hope 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.230
 you like the program and have mine 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.180
 small program preview review as well 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.830
 I always fell and then I would 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.800
 happy if you subscribe to my videos 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.780

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.400

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.400
 Okay, we'll see each other if you go now
