00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.840
 let's see what are the equivalents of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 sugar that contain the different types 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.960
 of food that you may be 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.940
 consuming 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.680
 What I would show you is that the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.250
 organism converts carbohydrates into 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.800
 sugar 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 let's start with a typical cereal breakfast 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.640
 toasted 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.829
 orange juice 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 and a banana 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.340
 the cereal has approximately one 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 quarter cup of sugar 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.719
 on toast it has approximately 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.719
 a quarter cup of sugar 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.910
 the orange juice has approximately 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.910
 a quarter cup of sugar 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 and the banana has approximately one 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.449
 eighth of a cup of sugar that only 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.370
 breakfast let's say the 10 of the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.960
 tomorrow you're hungry and if you eat something 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 for example a yogurt that has 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 fruit in the background this kind of software 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 low fat has the huge 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 equivalent of a quarter cup of 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.990
 sugar 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 and for lunch let's say that you 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 he is taking care of the lines and eating 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250
 a chicken breast without the skin and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 a baked potato and a bread the chicken 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 has in his folder the potato has the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 tremendous equivalent of a quarter of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.180
 cup of sugar in it and the bread also 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.180
 has a quarter cup of sugar 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.810
 and when it arrives at 3 in the afternoon and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.119
 I felt tired you eat a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.119
 how many sweets and a soft drink 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.980
 the sweet has about a quarter 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.080
 of what I guess sugar 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.470
 the soda also has 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.900
 about a quarter of sugar 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.080
 then for dinner you behave well 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.480
 and eat low fat foods so 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.110
 try to do the right thing as 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.180
 then pasta bread and a soda in the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.370
 pasta again of about a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.340
 quarter cup of sugar bread has 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.120
 another room and the refreshment another room of 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 cup of sugar starts to give an idea 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.900
 see how much sugar you have 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.540
 food that consumes you is incredible 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.730
 true, keep in mind now that you are 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.290
 increases of sugar demand a rise of 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.360
 insulin to eliminate all the sugar 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.500
 of blood flow this only represents 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.020
 one day multiplied by 365 days and then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.490
 for the age that you have then it goes 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.350
 to begin to understand why to the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.850
 most people find it so difficult 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.800
 lose weight and why there are so many people 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.800
 with number of diseases
