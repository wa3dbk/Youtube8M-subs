00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and check the front tire pressure 35

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:04.209 
and check the front tire pressure 35
pounds

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
front count where you want to check make

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.690 
front count where you want to check make
sure<00:02:12.210> they're<00:02:12.510> tight<00:02:13.190> hold<00:02:14.190> 12<00:02:14.490> millimeters

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
sure they're tight hold 12 millimeters

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.270 
sure they're tight hold 12 millimeters
and<00:02:17.750> then<00:02:18.750> you'll<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.380> 40<00:02:20.070> millimeter

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and then you'll have a 40 millimeter

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.310 
and then you'll have a 40 millimeter
axle<00:02:21.060> bolt<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.600> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> check<00:02:21.990> make

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
axle bolt you also want to check make
