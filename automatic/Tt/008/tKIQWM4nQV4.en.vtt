 story meanwhile the third one already and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 it is a tricky topic today because 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.670
 The internship is also part of school 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.650
 and I thought today I want 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.079
 my first internship because right now 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.370

 sister then comes an internship 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.160
 I was thinking okay clear 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 are you talking about your first 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.930
 internship what was going on and how often I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 yes friends became crazy because I came 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 that there are more to do than before 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.489
 the whole people then fun and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.289
 fooling one but of course I have 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.600
 also learned a lot and i'll tell you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.449
 synonymous right now with my turns 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.329
 I can tell by the fall 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 you directly what I do what job 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.969
 my first internship was and that was that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 cook yes I chose cooking then because 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.850
 I like to cook and like to cook 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.210
 actually I had only play etc 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 and that's why I wanted to cook 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 but never really about it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.960
 thought so at the time yes what 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.220
 is with working hours and so because yes 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 at the time make and feel about it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.009
 no head over anything if you have that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 first internship then you are 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 anyway too young that evening 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.409
 work and that's why it was there anyway 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.299
 In any case, I was shit once 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.140

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.170
 hard I always knew such a right 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 I had to lie down for a long time 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.820

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.040

 I hold a headgear while cooking 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.660
 because I've always been so 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.430

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.680
 some want to mirror eggs and so on 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.030
 and so on, but friends, that will be 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.060
 really funny yes I have it now 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 just the construction of internships 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.970
 then the cold kitchen came first 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.460
 Breakfast then cold kitchen was there 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.190

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.930
 and so on, what you did everything 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.570
 then at some point came the hot kitchen 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.280
 So for lunch and so on and 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.290
 so on and I swear it to you by the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.670
 Sport exploited so I wanted worse 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.620
 exploited as every mother on the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.800
 street yes i wanted to exploited that way 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.209
 I had to peel potato every day 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.980
 I do not know if I have yours already 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.420
 have made live potato but that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.370
 is the inferior work this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.959
 I only had to give 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.910
 really several hours 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.320
 potato peel as I said okay 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.720
 gave everything and says then you get 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 Okay, that has to be shielded now 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.230
 start there so I really had to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.500
 several hours of potato peeling that was 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.570
 such a disgusting work and that has to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.440
 I really had to do it day in and day out 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.850
 Of course every time yes the the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.230
 Garbage away and that was now 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.850
 not so small containers or something 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.140
 that was sometimes really big things 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.600
 especially if nobody is like that then 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.920
 Rind was there like bones and so on 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.750
 ding even a few kilos 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.150
 then you had to run a half marathon 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.860
 because that is allowed, of course, everything in the hotel 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.600
 of course that must be far away 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.970
 so i had to run over parking 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.850
 That's what I wanted so exploited so well 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.799
 Really such a practitioner will be one way or the other 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.180
 exploits that clearly show the so 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.340
 of course then must the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.080
 Dirty work making friends is different 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.670
 it just does not stop being a practitioner 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.260
 Of course you can also be lucky 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.910
 usually one is exploited and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.760
 Of course, then I always would 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.230
 Have fun with me before that 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.530
 best of all i knew, of course 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.030
 every time in this room where this 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.740
 Storage room exactly in this storage room 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.570
 I had to go every once and somehow 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.240
 bring shit if anything 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.200
 I had to go there like this and 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.560
 That's when you said the author 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.880
 password 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.040
 I have to go to the elevator that one 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.150
 piece completely free before anything could 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.880
 in april on the mobile co 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.200
 that was all fit but then had to 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.320
 they said georgio can you 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.570

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.540
 spice he was called I do not know exactly where 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.610
 somehow blue pepper or fight 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.140
 so anything with blue and pepper and 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.850
 Okay , I'm ok, I think so 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.310

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.550
 Therefore, I can see through and I search 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.500

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.370

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.260

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.850

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.280

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:12.290
 funny situation but could not be 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.360
 but her little wanker is like that 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.820
 that in the internship yes if I somehow 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.900
 at some point take some interns 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.460
 I would think so too 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.260
 Any unnecessary things say so 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.940
 he has to do because it 's easy 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.310
 funny yes it's funny we have it so 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.870
 not mean it was a cool one 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.580
 time as a chef I can not really 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.190
 recommend but a very exhausting 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.410
 job but i can do that i can 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.690
 really recommend it was cool it has bock 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.790
 The people were really right there 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.860
 so it went in any case 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.420
 fit and you can my comments 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.740
 Write what kind of practitioner you are 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.230
 have graduated , if any 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.940
 or you are currently one 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.280
 intern in it since I do not know 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.990
 so and as I said I have done 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.130
 and I would recommend the 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.600
 working time not so shitty then 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.370
 i would even work as a cook because 

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.660
 cooking is really fun especially in the 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.190
 People always smile like that 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.840
 magic is a cool thing 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.040
 thing and there I would say if you 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.780
 the video has liked friends and you 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.630
 more so trains stories higher mixes 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.040
 then thumb up or through life it 

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.250
 are enough things house connections up 

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.250
