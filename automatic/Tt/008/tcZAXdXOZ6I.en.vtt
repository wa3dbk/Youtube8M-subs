00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
hi this is artist Tara Reid and I want

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.810 
hi this is artist Tara Reid and I want
to<00:00:07.410> talk<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> little<00:00:08.189> bit<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
to talk to you a little bit about a

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.089 
to talk to you a little bit about a
computer<00:00:09.360> skill<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.200> can<00:00:10.920> be

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
computer skill that I think can be

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.100 
computer skill that I think can be
really<00:00:11.460> helpful<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.000> if<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.480> want<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.929> be

really helpful to you if you want to be

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.829 
really helpful to you if you want to be
successful<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.860> art<00:00:14.130> licensing<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
successful in art licensing and that is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
successful in art licensing and that is
learning<00:00:16.230> how<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.500> create<00:00:16.920> repeat<00:00:17.520> orders<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
learning how to create repeat orders and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
learning how to create repeat orders and
repeat<00:00:18.600> patterns<00:00:19.279> some<00:00:20.279> people<00:00:20.580> aren't

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
repeat patterns some people aren't

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029 
repeat patterns some people aren't
really<00:00:21.000> into<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> computer<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.560> this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
really into the computer thing but this

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.220 
really into the computer thing but this
is<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> skill<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:24.300> make<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.660> marketable

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
is a skill that can make you marketable

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.790 
is a skill that can make you marketable
especially<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.369> today's<00:00:26.730> marketplace<00:00:27.210> where

especially in today's marketplace where

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.750 
especially in today's marketplace where
manufacturers<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:29.039> having<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> tighten<00:00:29.670> the

if you can already have it set up the
way<00:00:36.090> they<00:00:36.329> need<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.110> you're<00:00:37.620> more<00:00:37.860> likely

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
way they need it then you're more likely

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.630 
way they need it then you're more likely
to<00:00:38.670> get<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> deal<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.260> where<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:41.190> repeat

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
to get the deal so where would repeat

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940 
to get the deal so where would repeat

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
patterns come into play here's a few

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
patterns come into play here's a few
examples<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> products<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> have

examples of products that I have

examples of products that I have
licensed<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.410> repeat<00:00:46.829> patterns<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
licensed that use repeat patterns one is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.369 
licensed that use repeat patterns one is
wrapping<00:00:49.020> paper

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
wrapping paper

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
wrapping paper
you<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.129> wrapping<00:00:50.489> paper<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> roll<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you know wrapping paper is a roll and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
you know wrapping paper is a roll and
there<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.870> no<00:00:51.960> lines<00:00:52.379> down<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> show

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
there are no lines down it that show

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.830 
there are no lines down it that show
where<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.579> pattern<00:00:54.030> stops<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
where the pattern stops so they

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.410 
where the pattern stops so they
absolutely<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:56.070> repeat<00:00:56.370> patterns<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
absolutely need repeat patterns and it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
absolutely need repeat patterns and it
was<00:00:57.570> actually<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:58.079> first<00:00:58.320> wrapping<00:00:59.010> paper

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

figure<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.600> tweak<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.740> system<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
figure out and tweak the system so that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
figure out and tweak the system so that
it<00:01:11.610> worked<00:01:12.409> another<00:01:13.409> place<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.130> use

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it worked another place that I use

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
it worked another place that I use
repeat<00:01:14.729> patterns<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.689> fabric<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
repeat patterns a lot is in fabric and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
repeat patterns a lot is in fabric and
this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.280> great<00:01:17.490> example<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.150> mean<00:01:18.299> look<00:01:18.479> at

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
this is a great example I mean look at

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
this is a great example I mean look at
all<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.369> repeat<00:01:20.369> patterns<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
all these different repeat patterns and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
all these different repeat patterns and
different<00:01:21.330> colorways<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.439> come

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
different colorways that have come

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.109 
different colorways that have come
together<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.869> look<00:01:25.880> at<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
together now also if you look at this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.289 
together now also if you look at this
fabric<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.650> repeat<00:01:29.040> pattern<00:01:29.299> created

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
fabric this is a repeat pattern created

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
fabric this is a repeat pattern created
out<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.570> repeat<00:01:31.110> borders<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.100> being<00:01:32.579> able<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
out of repeat borders so being able to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480 
out of repeat borders so being able to
do<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> repeat<00:01:33.600> border<00:01:33.990> process<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.770> having

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
do the repeat border process and having

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.050 
do the repeat border process and having
the<00:01:35.579> patterns<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.210> good<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.869> well<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:38.060> borders

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the patterns is good as well and borders

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
the patterns is good as well and borders
is<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.390> easy<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.470> teach<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is really easy you I teach you that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
is really easy you I teach you that
first<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.939> repeat

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
first and then you can do repeat

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
first and then you can do repeat
patterns<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.590> gift<00:01:43.740> bags<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.280> repeat

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
patterns a lot of gift bags have repeat

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.249 
patterns a lot of gift bags have repeat
patterns<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.180> create<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> paper<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> then

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
patterns they create the paper and then

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
patterns they create the paper and then
they<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> fold<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> all<00:01:47.130> together<00:01:47.299> sometimes

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
they just fold it all together sometimes

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
they just fold it all together sometimes
there<00:01:48.479> might<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.750> repeat<00:01:49.110> border<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.740> goes

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
there might be a repeat border that goes

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.139
