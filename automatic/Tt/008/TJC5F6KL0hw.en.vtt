00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
can see how this isn't straight with

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.139

this and as you'll see later when I put
on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> motorcycle<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:44.520> isn't<00:00:45.360> exactly

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
on the motorcycle it isn't exactly

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.369 
on the motorcycle it isn't exactly
perfectly<00:00:46.230> straight<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:48.379> curved

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
perfectly straight up this is curved

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.000 
perfectly straight up this is curved
slightly<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:51.620> am<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.129> yeah<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:55.620> rated

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
slightly down I am so yeah I it's rated

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.580 
slightly down I am so yeah I it's rated
up<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> 700<00:00:56.699> pounds<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.210> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> people<00:00:58.440> say

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
up to 700 pounds a lot of people say

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.599 
up to 700 pounds a lot of people say
that<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:58.859> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> for

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that they don't want to use it for

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.000 
that they don't want to use it for
really<00:00:59.969> heavy<00:01:00.390> bikes<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.739> say<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
really heavy bikes because they say it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.179 
really heavy bikes because they say it
would<00:01:02.100> break<00:01:02.309> ah<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> ninja<00:01:04.530> 250<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
would break ah I have a ninja 250 so it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
would break ah I have a ninja 250 so it
isn't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.489> too<00:01:05.700> heavy<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:05.970> anything<00:01:06.140> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
isn't really too heavy or anything so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.730 
isn't really too heavy or anything so
it's<00:01:07.290> doable

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it's doable

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.969 
it's doable
um<00:01:08.689> it<00:01:09.689> needs<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.049> assembly<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
um it needs to assembly when you get it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
um it needs to assembly when you get it
basically<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> piece<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.900> piece

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
basically you get this piece this piece

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.700 
basically you get this piece this piece
and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> piece<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.259> bubble<00:01:16.259> wrap<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and then this piece in bubble wrap and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.330 
and then this piece in bubble wrap and
then<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> few<00:01:17.189> bolts<00:01:17.430> these<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.920> spool<00:01:19.920> holders

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
then a few bolts these two spool holders

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.390 
then a few bolts these two spool holders
in<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.909> plastic<00:01:21.630> bag<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:23.180> basically<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:25.400> you

in a plastic bag and basically I you
don't<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> bag

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you don't get the instructions have to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.319 
you don't get the instructions have to
go<00:01:29.189> online<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.549> print<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> instruction

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
go online and print out the instruction

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.429 
go online and print out the instruction
this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> page<00:01:30.960> 2<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.470> basically<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:33.380> lot<00:01:34.380> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
its just useless stuff but I using the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.929 
its just useless stuff but I using the
instructions<00:01:37.770> basically<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.460> assembly

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
instructions basically the assembly

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
instructions basically the assembly
instructions<00:01:39.390> only<00:01:39.540> tell<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> how<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> put

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
instructions only tell you how to put

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859 
instructions only tell you how to put
these<00:01:41.070> things<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.570> tell<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

put the whole thing together but I mean
it's<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.479> self-explanatory<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:46.200> have

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it's pretty self-explanatory you have

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
it's pretty self-explanatory you have
three<00:01:47.070> holes<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.610> three<00:01:48.060> holes

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
three holes in this thing three holes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
three holes in this thing three holes
here<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.320> bolt<00:01:49.649> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
here and then you just you just bolt it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.010 
here and then you just you just bolt it
in<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.990> by<00:01:51.990> holding<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> screw<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> then

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
in with a by holding the screw and then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.000 
in with a by holding the screw and then
with<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> 10<00:01:55.500> millimeter<00:01:56.180> socket

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
with a 10 millimeter socket

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.450 
with a 10 millimeter socket
your<00:01:59.010> socket<00:01:59.310> wrench<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.800> that's<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.250> get

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
your socket wrench so that's how you get

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.430 
your socket wrench so that's how you get
that<00:02:02.580> on<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.760> these<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.210> basically<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
that on to get these in basically you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680 
that on to get these in basically you
losing<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:07.950> four<00:02:08.760> bolts<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> lift<00:02:09.570> up

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
losing these four bolts and you lift up

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.150 
losing these four bolts and you lift up
this<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.110> square<00:02:10.470> piece<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.040> see

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
this little square piece as you can see

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
this little square piece as you can see
it's<00:02:11.310> two<00:02:11.490> separate<00:02:11.850> pieces<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:13.350> lift

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's two separate pieces there you lift

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
it's two separate pieces there you lift
that<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:15.030> get<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.960> slide

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that up and you get a you just slide

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
that up and you get a you just slide
this<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.740> take<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.760> also<00:02:17.910> how

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
this in you take it and that's also how

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.410 
this in you take it and that's also how
you<00:02:18.180> adjust<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.810> width<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:20.160> these<00:02:20.490> you're

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you adjust the width of these you're

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.790 
you adjust the width of these you're
basically<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.900> loosening<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
basically just loosening it up and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.150 
basically just loosening it up and
sliding<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> back<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.430> forth<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.120> very

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
sliding it back and forth so very

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160 
sliding it back and forth so very
rudimentary<00:02:26.160> adjustment<00:02:26.850> system<00:02:27.210> when<00:02:28.080> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
rudimentary adjustment system when you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
rudimentary adjustment system when you
get<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> though<00:02:28.710> I<00:02:28.980> mean<00:02:29.760> when<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.970> when<00:02:30.300> you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
get it though I mean when you when you

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.700 
get it though I mean when you when you
look<00:02:30.480> at<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.660> instructions<00:02:31.080> you'll<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
look at the instructions you'll see it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.650 
look at the instructions you'll see it
lists<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.100> these<00:02:32.310> things<00:02:32.610> you'll<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.540> like

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
lists all these things you'll be like

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.750 
lists all these things you'll be like
well<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> only<00:02:34.050> got<00:02:34.200> three<00:02:34.530> parts<00:02:34.860> that's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
well I only got three parts that's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.950 
well I only got three parts that's
because<00:02:36.000> most<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.240> its<00:02:36.390> already<00:02:36.510> assembled

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
because most of its already assembled

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.180 
because most of its already assembled
like<00:02:37.140> these<00:02:37.320> are<00:02:37.500> already<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> wheels

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
like these are already on the wheels

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
like these are already on the wheels
already<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.480> wheels<00:02:39.690> are<00:02:39.810> made<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
already on the wheels are made up like a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
already on the wheels are made up like a
silicon<00:02:40.620> type<00:02:40.920> by<00:02:41.660> type<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.840> substance<00:02:44.390> so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
silicon type by type of substance so

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.510 
silicon type by type of substance so
don't<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.870> you're<00:02:45.960> missing<00:02:46.080> stuff

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
don't think that you're missing stuff

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.650 
don't think that you're missing stuff
like<00:02:47.520> all<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.760> all<00:02:47.910> these<00:02:48.060> bolts<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.420> stuff

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like all the all these bolts and stuff

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.770 
like all the all these bolts and stuff
they're<00:02:48.810> already<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:51.560> yeah<00:02:53.780> I'd

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
they're already in there so yeah I'd

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.820 
they're already in there so yeah I'd
also<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.500> let's<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.640> else<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.940> there<00:02:57.830> um

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
also I let's see what else is there um

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.220 
also I let's see what else is there um
they<00:02:59.400> come<00:02:59.730> they<00:03:00.090> could<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.900> could<00:03:00.930> get

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
they come they could you could get

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.290 
they come they could you could get
paddled<00:03:01.560> afters<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:03.110> which<00:03:05.030> they<00:03:06.030> say<00:03:06.180> on

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
paddled afters for it which they say on

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.780 
paddled afters for it which they say on
the<00:03:06.390> parts<00:03:06.600> list<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> they're<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.489> include

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
the parts list but they're not include

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.190 
the parts list but they're not include
I'm<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.360> sure<00:03:09.480> about<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.810> price<00:03:10.020> on

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I'm not really sure about the price on

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.510 
I'm not really sure about the price on
them<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> power<00:03:10.830> adapters<00:03:11.370> would

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
them and then the power adapters would

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.170 
them and then the power adapters would
go<00:03:12.800> underneath<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.040> swing<00:03:14.310> arm<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
go underneath the swing arm here and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.790 
go underneath the swing arm here and
then<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> other<00:03:15.780> side<00:03:17.810> here<00:03:18.810> some<00:03:19.500> people

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
then on the other side here some people

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.770 
then on the other side here some people
who<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.520> other<00:03:20.700> bikes<00:03:21.000> they<00:03:21.270> say<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.570> the

swing<00:03:22.110> arms<00:03:22.440> scratched<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.310> bottom<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.670> their

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
swing arms scratched the bottom of their

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.580 
swing arms scratched the bottom of their
exhaust<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.540> custom<00:03:27.840> exhaust<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.320> also

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
I didn't get the swing arm so I don't

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.170 
I didn't get the swing arm so I don't
know<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.390> would<00:03:30.540> reach<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.260> high<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
know if it would reach that high but I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.210 
know if it would reach that high but I
opted<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.959> schools<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.070> got

this and also the size on these bolts

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.860 
this and also the size on these bolts
for<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.519> allen<00:03:50.820> wrench<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.600> plaque

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
for the allen wrench is like the plaque

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.440 
for the allen wrench is like the plaque
I<00:03:52.230> think<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.160> bigger<00:03:53.340> black<00:03:53.730> Allen<00:03:54.269> wrench

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
I think the bigger black Allen wrench

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.300 
I think the bigger black Allen wrench
that<00:03:54.690> comes<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.050> your<00:03:55.170> ninja<00:03:55.350> 250<00:03:55.800> toolkit<00:03:56.160> if
