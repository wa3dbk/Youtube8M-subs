00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.500

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.330
 right now we 're going to create a 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.390
 creative world 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 where but advance we are going to put you very 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 word is fine if nothing 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.070
 creative better if everything random and what 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's create good what is happening 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.330
 right now guys, we're staying 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 no memory in ios ok 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.570
 we run out of memory at the time of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.879
 play I do not know why until I good I think 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.270
 that all users have already raised a 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.780
 this 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 a thomas h chile form went up 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.560
 so that we put the two devices 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 our time to play if we play in 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.260
 wifi with several players or what wave does not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 and this one 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 let's find this guatafan 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 It is very bad this 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.550
 rendering right now I guess that since 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 I will correct it in 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.410
 What is the performance of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.750
 I play ok for now because that's how it's going to be 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.400
 the game and good guys for nothing to warn 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 I'll be the start but it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.869
 same 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 and well, right now, just 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.170
 I wanted to show a little bit of this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 minecraft how it dances 0.9 on an ipad there 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.740
 options 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.740
 everything to the maximum 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.600
 to see if that memory disappears 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 it is a book what of the memory that 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 finish the memory 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.430
 they are going to correct it I suppose I hope 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.370
 and well let's see if it's hard for us to say 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.380
 that in this update there is in sister 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.540
 island think we all know what 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.940
 there are no wolves 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.770
 well villages stronghold villagers already 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.620
 You can create the spoilers right now 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.020
 we believe they do not love each other and nothing 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.880
 All this I think we all know already 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.280
 because as in android they were already 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.800
 the suite there are already many tutorials about 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.420
 how to create things and all this that and good 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.010
 Well, let's start the series 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 it was just a video like this quickie 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.980
 Well, more than anything informative 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.600
 As you can see, it 's seeing quite a bit now 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.120
 same to see good is not me 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.310
 reading but at the time of generation 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.290
 It's not generating the ground very well 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.049
 let's see now if it is the memory 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 I hope it appears if not, well, guys 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.040
 this is going to be everything 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.360
 As you know, there are many things very 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.970
 many new things that we will already see 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.470
 in the series to begin with we have all 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.940
 the new stones that are here all 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.780
 the laws 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.030
 The emeralds 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.680
 and good among other things are not 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 the drumsticks that are these 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.430
 is the language of sexy anxiety is a 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.170
 collection very very chingona the truth 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.060
 only that if you find a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.989
 little bit of correction the books yet 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.910
 at least on ios maybe on android 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.319
 it's going very well but in the year it's the truth 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.319
 is that if he needs a little bit 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 and that's how the loaves are made 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.720
 which are very easy to do 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.860
 and then I think that nothing more kids nothing 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.670
 more than saying 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.180
 I really hope they are correcting 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.180
 all 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.920
 and well that exposes them without anything 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 mister meta joe we are on a ipad r 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.239
 17 and well nothing if you liked the video 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.750
 live favorites and comment and even the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.290

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.290
