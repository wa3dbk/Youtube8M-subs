00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
okay it's Christmas Eve I wanted to do

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.179 
okay it's Christmas Eve I wanted to do
some<00:00:04.799> logging<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:06.560> figured<00:00:07.560> why<00:00:07.710> not<00:00:07.740> shoot<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
some logging and figured why not shoot a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:18.980 
some logging and figured why not shoot a
video<00:00:08.460> while<00:00:08.670> I'm<00:00:08.820> doing<00:00:09.090> it

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 

and<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.349> thought<00:00:19.529> why<00:00:19.769> not<00:00:19.830> doing<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.310> 60<00:00:20.609> frames

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and I thought why not doing in 60 frames

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.919 
and I thought why not doing in 60 frames
a<00:00:20.910> second<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:24.589> got<00:00:25.589> my<00:00:27.590> laptop<00:00:28.590> set<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.309> here

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
a second so got my laptop set up here

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:45.380 
a second so got my laptop set up here
it's<00:00:30.929> running<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> software

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.370 

it's<00:00:45.870> running<00:00:46.109> the<00:00:46.199> software<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.649> need

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.440 

to<00:00:51.800> basically<00:00:52.250> log<00:00:52.490> everything<00:00:52.850> I<00:00:53.090> need<00:00:53.300> for

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
to basically log everything I need for

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:11.560 
to basically log everything I need for
my<00:00:53.510> tuner

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840 

this<00:01:12.140> isn't<00:01:12.440> gonna<00:01:12.530> be<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.770> long<00:01:13.040> video<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:13.580> hope

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
this isn't gonna be a long video I hope

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.420 
this isn't gonna be a long video I hope
I<00:01:14.300> just<00:01:14.870> hope<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.290> can<00:01:15.409> get<00:01:15.500> away<00:01:15.620> from<00:01:15.800> some<00:01:16.400> of

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
I just hope I can get away from some of

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.480 
I just hope I can get away from some of
this<00:01:16.580> traffic<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:17.420> can<00:01:17.600> actually<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:19.430> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
this traffic so I can actually get a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.700 
this traffic so I can actually get a
decent<00:01:19.729> pole<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:20.510> don't<00:01:20.810> like<00:01:21.020> doing<00:01:21.260> polls

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
decent pole I don't like doing polls

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.140 
decent pole I don't like doing polls
when<00:01:22.220> there's<00:01:22.430> traffic<00:01:22.700> around

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.700 

so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.260> thing<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so I basically have this thing it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.040 
so I basically have this thing it's
polling<00:01:32.300> information<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:34.080> connects<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.620> the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
polling information it connects to the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.810 
polling information it connects to the
connects<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.360> ODB<00:01:39.360> two-port

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.580 

and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.830 

I<00:01:45.679> just<00:01:46.189> have<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.429> hit<00:01:46.579> record<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.359> it<00:01:47.719> will

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
I just have to hit record and it will

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:58.870 
I just have to hit record and it will
record<00:01:48.850> everything

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.790 

the<00:01:59.420> unfortunate<00:01:59.750> thing<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.680> only

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
the unfortunate thing is that it only

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.440 
the unfortunate thing is that it only
runs<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.280> Windows

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
runs on Windows

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:18.270 
runs on Windows
I'm<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> Mac<00:02:04.409> guy

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.790 

there's<00:02:18.850> too<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:19.210> traffic<00:02:19.600> going<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.170> way

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.050 

I<00:02:27.830> wish<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:28.640> out<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.450> max

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.690 

it's<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:33.900> windows

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.400 

the<00:02:40.120> software<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.660> question<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.680> qtek

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.149 

great<00:02:45.980> software

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
great software

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.039 
great software
probably<00:02:49.159> one<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.459> highest<00:02:50.049> most

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
probably one of the highest most

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.720 
probably one of the highest most
expensive<00:02:51.739> tuning<00:02:52.129> up

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
expensive tuning up

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.600 
expensive tuning up
tuning<00:02:54.480> applications<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.459> Subarus<00:02:56.459> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.020 

you<00:02:59.850> know<00:03:00.000> FERC's<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.640> tune<00:03:02.640> most

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you know FERC's you can tune most

you know FERC's you can tune most

Subarus with cobb accessport s-- because

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.860 
Subarus with cobb accessport s-- because
the<00:03:08.070> BRZ<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:08.940> boosted<00:03:09.480> from<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
the BRZ was not boosted from the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.830 
the BRZ was not boosted from the
beginning<00:03:10.320> Cobb<00:03:11.070> decided<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:14.210> not<00:03:15.210> supported

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
beginning Cobb decided to not supported

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.270 
beginning Cobb decided to not supported
so<00:03:17.390> Becky<00:03:18.390> tech<00:03:18.600> stepped<00:03:18.930> up

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.760 

she's<00:03:23.060> pumping<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.560> they're<00:03:25.190> able<00:03:25.310> to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.540 

basically<00:03:28.520> unlock<00:03:28.910> everything<00:03:29.390> in<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> ECU

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
basically unlock everything in the ECU

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.940 
basically unlock everything in the ECU
I'm<00:03:31.550> still<00:03:31.970> not<00:03:32.180> logging<00:03:32.510> yet

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:50.070 

want<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.520> get<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> full<00:03:37.970> pull<00:03:38.360> in

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080 

I<00:03:50.170> usually<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:51.010> over<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.490> so<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:51.940> turn

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
I usually go over here so I could turn

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.589 
I usually go over here so I could turn
around<00:03:52.150> and

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
take my time getting on and that way I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.449 
take my time getting on and that way I
can<00:04:07.099> also<00:04:07.780> pay<00:04:08.780> attention<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:09.459> everything

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
can also pay attention to everything

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.500 
can also pay attention to everything
