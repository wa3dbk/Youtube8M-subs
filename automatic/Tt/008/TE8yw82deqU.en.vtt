00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.840
 the customers are super happy in 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.330
 fuel economy know I have even 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.920
 it's monstrous so I saw 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 really do some tests on the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130
 fuel consumption look 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 the company of my brother who is taxi 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 it's still because they are 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.430
 descended per km2 1 liter to 100 donations that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.369
 he and his 6 centers the exercise he has 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.400
 makes a gain in consumption of 0 820 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 recover 120 to 125 km so that's when 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.130
 even many divisions are super 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.820
 happy that way they tell me 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 that they want to double 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.380
 that's his answer right now what all 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 customers are satisfied 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.180
 I have zero around negative I get the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 rest of the family and customers who 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 come to see me after even after 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 three weeks or one month of use 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.430
 who tell us they are satisfied 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 that they have recovery on the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 engine and so kilometers that make 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.250
 in addition to their consumption of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 fuel since I was using this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.110
 that china was going back a lot 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.369
 of which ratified with the shift of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 governed or car said in essence 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.520
 a small camp engine I found him 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 that we will exhale uphill there is no 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.720
 worry that's fine I came by 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.700
 chance and I asked if this is the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 car frankly explained to me the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 month long explained at the beginning a little 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:48.140
 skeptical even his car at 68 and you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 have a difference with the dish too 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.960
 and it's true I have a lot of two months 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:10.069
 it feels like that right now there is no 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:10.069
 I could picture please 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.709
 as soon as one accelerates for the most part to 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.709
 remake
