00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
really like to live in holes their

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.290 
really like to live in holes their
cavity<00:00:29.740> nesters<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.310> these<00:00:30.880> woodpecker

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
cavity nesters and these woodpecker

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.570 
cavity nesters and these woodpecker
homes<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.779> we<00:00:31.869> build<00:00:32.140> are<00:00:32.410> perfect<00:00:33.160> nesting

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
homes that we build are perfect nesting

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.760 
homes that we build are perfect nesting
sites<00:00:33.820> for<00:00:34.030> them<00:00:34.210> so<00:00:34.990> they<00:00:35.140> always<00:00:35.500> beat<00:00:35.740> the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
sites for them so they always beat the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.650 
sites for them so they always beat the
woodpeckers<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.880> punch<00:00:37.150> they<00:00:37.360> get<00:00:37.510> there

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
woodpeckers to the punch they get there

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.440 
woodpeckers to the punch they get there
before<00:00:37.780> them<00:00:38.200> or<00:00:39.040> so<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.910> thought

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
before them or so we thought

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.210 
before them or so we thought
this<00:00:40.930> year<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.200> did<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.500> little<00:00:41.740> bit<00:00:41.830> of<00:00:41.920> research

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
this year I did a little bit of research

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.100 
this year I did a little bit of research
and<00:00:42.520> learned<00:00:43.060> that<00:00:43.240> if<00:00:43.330> you<00:00:43.360> fill<00:00:43.720> these<00:00:43.900> boxes

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
and learned that if you fill these boxes

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.980 
and learned that if you fill these boxes
with<00:00:44.620> sawdust<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.850> prevents<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.510> starlings

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
with sawdust it prevents the starlings

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.690 
with sawdust it prevents the starlings
from<00:00:47.140> nesting<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:47.650> them<00:00:47.800> because<00:00:48.160> starlings

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
from nesting in them because starlings

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.120 
from nesting in them because starlings
can't<00:00:49.060> excavate<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.110> sawdust<00:00:50.560> from<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
can't excavate the sawdust from the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.550 
can't excavate the sawdust from the
house<00:00:51.280> flickers<00:00:52.150> on<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.450> other<00:00:52.600> hand<00:00:52.870> are

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
house flickers on the other hand are

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.590 
house flickers on the other hand are
very<00:00:53.890> good<00:00:54.190> excavators<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.030> not<00:00:55.150> only<00:00:55.300> do

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
very good excavators and not only do

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.480 
very good excavators and not only do
they<00:00:55.750> clear<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.380> sawdust<00:00:56.800> out<00:00:56.950> but<00:00:57.220> in<00:00:57.310> fact

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
they clear the sawdust out but in fact

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.830 
they clear the sawdust out but in fact
it<00:00:57.670> makes<00:00:57.820> them<00:00:58.000> feel<00:00:58.030> like<00:00:58.210> they<00:00:58.450> built<00:00:58.660> the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
it makes them feel like they built the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.990 
it makes them feel like they built the
house<00:00:58.990> themselves<00:00:59.310> which<00:01:00.310> gives<00:01:00.610> them<00:01:00.760> I

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
house themselves which gives them I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.190 
house themselves which gives them I
don't<00:01:01.060> know<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.270> greater<00:01:01.720> sense<00:01:02.050> of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
don't know a greater sense of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.469 
don't know a greater sense of
satisfaction<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:03.670> birds<00:01:03.940> are<00:01:04.299> not

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
satisfaction these birds are not

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.149 
satisfaction these birds are not
strangers<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.289> one<00:01:05.409> another<00:01:05.679> you<00:01:05.979> know

strangers to one another you know
they've<00:01:06.340> only<00:01:06.429> been<00:01:07.030> interacting<00:01:07.749> for<00:01:07.960> about

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
they've only been interacting for about

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.560 
they've only been interacting for about
150<00:01:08.770> years<00:01:09.009> but<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.820> that<00:01:10.060> time<00:01:10.299> they've

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
150 years but in that time they've

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.630 
150 years but in that time they've
quickly<00:01:10.840> learned<00:01:11.229> that<00:01:11.799> they<00:01:12.100> do<00:01:12.159> not<00:01:12.340> like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
quickly learned that they do not like

about 50 or 60 degrees and a gentle

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.750 
about 50 or 60 degrees and a gentle
right<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.500> left<00:03:44.680> wind<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.100> also<00:03:45.220> picked<00:03:45.610> up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
right to left wind it also picked up

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.570 
right to left wind it also picked up
that<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.030> had<00:03:46.240> to<00:03:46.330> account<00:03:46.570> for<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:48.340> I

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
that I had to account for but I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.490 
that I had to account for but I
delivered<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.150> shot<00:03:49.360> cleanly<00:03:49.840> hit<00:03:50.170> him<00:03:50.290> right

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
delivered the shot cleanly hit him right

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.470 
delivered the shot cleanly hit him right
in<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.740> neck<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.400> bird<00:03:51.640> was<00:03:51.850> instantly

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
in the neck and this bird was instantly

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.070 
in the neck and this bird was instantly
dead

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.490 

so<00:04:02.080> more<00:04:02.620> waiting<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.490> waiting<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.780> waiting

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
so more waiting and waiting and waiting

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.190 
so more waiting and waiting and waiting
I<00:04:06.000> was<00:04:07.000> starting<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.390> think<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.750> didn't<00:04:08.020> know

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
I was starting to think I didn't know

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.540 
I was starting to think I didn't know
starlings<00:04:08.680> quite<00:04:08.890> as<00:04:09.010> well<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.280> thought<00:04:09.490> I

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
starlings quite as well as I thought I

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.820 
starlings quite as well as I thought I
did<00:04:09.850> this<00:04:10.150> sound<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.600> chicks<00:04:10.870> made<00:04:11.140> told<00:04:11.740> me

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
did this sound the chicks made told me

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.950 
did this sound the chicks made told me
that<00:04:11.980> they<00:04:12.100> were<00:04:12.220> gonna<00:04:12.310> come<00:04:12.700> out<00:04:13.390> within<00:04:13.720> you

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
that they were gonna come out within you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.080 
that they were gonna come out within you
know<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.110> day<00:04:14.440> or<00:04:14.470> two<00:04:14.800> but<00:04:15.580> they<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.910> weren't

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
know a day or two but they just weren't

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.220 
know a day or two but they just weren't
popping<00:04:16.450> their<00:04:16.570> heads<00:04:16.720> out<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.049> hole

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
popping their heads out of the hole

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.490 
popping their heads out of the hole
until<00:04:17.980> about<00:04:18.489> two<00:04:18.760> or<00:04:18.910> three<00:04:18.940> hours<00:04:19.120> passed<00:04:19.690> by

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.140 

and<00:04:23.500> after<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> first<00:04:24.070> chick<00:04:24.370> finally<00:04:24.880> stuck

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
and after the first chick finally stuck

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.610 
and after the first chick finally stuck
his<00:04:25.270> head<00:04:25.390> out<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.660> hole<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:26.110> would<00:04:26.230> go<00:04:26.350> really

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
his head out the hole it would go really

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.980 
his head out the hole it would go really
fast<00:04:26.920> after<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:27.580> all<00:04:28.030> three<00:04:28.480> chicks<00:04:28.810> would

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
fast after this all three chicks would

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.500 
fast after this all three chicks would
be<00:04:29.110> dead<00:04:29.350> within<00:04:29.380> ten<00:04:29.890> minutes<00:04:30.360> then<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.480> can

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
be dead within ten minutes then you can

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.270 
be dead within ten minutes then you can
see<00:04:31.810> from<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.080> size<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.530> these<00:04:32.620> guys<00:04:32.680> that

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
see from the size of these guys that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.340 
see from the size of these guys that
they<00:04:33.610> weren't<00:04:33.850> very<00:04:34.210> far<00:04:34.540> away<00:04:34.690> from<00:04:35.110> flying

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
they weren't very far away from flying

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.530 
they weren't very far away from flying
away<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.610> chicks<00:04:36.880> you're<00:04:36.970> looking<00:04:37.270> at<00:04:37.390> here

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
away the chicks you're looking at here

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.870 
away the chicks you're looking at here
probably<00:04:37.840> can't<00:04:38.290> fly<00:04:38.590> they<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.430> didn't<00:04:39.760> have

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
probably can't fly they just didn't have

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.460 
probably can't fly they just didn't have
the<00:04:39.970> confidence<00:04:40.210> or<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.750> wasn't<00:04:41.080> quite<00:04:41.170> their

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the confidence or it wasn't quite their

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.580 
the confidence or it wasn't quite their
time<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.740> yet<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.720> 24<00:04:43.720> hours<00:04:44.020> or<00:04:44.140> less<00:04:44.380> these

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
time just yet in 24 hours or less these

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.840 
time just yet in 24 hours or less these
chicks<00:04:44.920> would<00:04:45.100> have<00:04:45.190> become<00:04:45.310> part<00:04:45.700> of<00:04:45.730> the

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
chicks would have become part of the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.940 
chicks would have become part of the
problem

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.350 

and<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.160> only<00:04:53.310> regret<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.670> actually<00:04:53.940> have<00:04:54.330> I

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and the only regret I actually have I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.450 
and the only regret I actually have I
said<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.690> took<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.990> bad<00:04:55.230> angle<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.010> birdhouse

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
said I took a bad angle on the birdhouse

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.120 
said I took a bad angle on the birdhouse
you<00:04:57.270> can<00:04:57.420> see<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.810> with<00:04:58.170> this<00:04:58.380> angle<00:04:58.770> as<00:04:58.980> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
you can see that with this angle as the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.310 
you can see that with this angle as the
pellet<00:04:59.430> passed<00:04:59.700> through<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.240> bird<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.780> also

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
pellet passed through the bird and also

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.230 
pellet passed through the bird and also
nicked<00:05:01.920> up<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.280> wood<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.460> little<00:05:02.640> bit<00:05:02.880> on<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
nicked up the wood a little bit on the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.750 
nicked up the wood a little bit on the
left-hand<00:05:03.840> side<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.170> birdhouse<00:05:04.460> if<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.550> had

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
left-hand side of the birdhouse if I had

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.400 
left-hand side of the birdhouse if I had
a<00:05:05.790> little<00:05:05.970> better<00:05:06.210> foresight<00:05:06.840> out<00:05:06.990> of<00:05:07.110> taking

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
a little better foresight out of taking

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.200 
a little better foresight out of taking
an<00:05:07.500> angle<00:05:07.830> farther<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.430> right<00:05:08.790> so<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.090> I

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
an angle farther to the right so that I

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.730 
an angle farther to the right so that I
could<00:05:09.480> pass<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.930> pellet<00:05:10.230> through<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.560> bird

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
could pass the pellet through the bird

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.550 
could pass the pellet through the bird
without<00:05:10.920> striking<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.640> house<00:05:11.760> itself<00:05:12.560> but

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
without striking the house itself but

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.860 
without striking the house itself but
the<00:05:13.710> damage<00:05:14.040> was<00:05:14.280> mostly<00:05:14.760> just<00:05:14.850> cosmetic<00:05:15.660> so

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
the damage was mostly just cosmetic so

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.210 
the damage was mostly just cosmetic so
it<00:05:16.170> wasn't<00:05:16.470> too<00:05:16.560> big<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.890> deal

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
it wasn't too big of a deal

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.590 
it wasn't too big of a deal
the<00:05:17.280> landowner<00:05:17.610> didn't<00:05:17.940> mind<00:05:18.150> one<00:05:18.360> bit<00:05:18.390> she

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
the landowner didn't mind one bit she

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.150 
the landowner didn't mind one bit she
was<00:05:18.900> happy<00:05:19.140> to<00:05:19.170> have<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.470> starlings<00:05:19.890> out<00:05:20.040> of

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
was happy to have the starlings out of

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:28.879 
was happy to have the starlings out of
there

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.709 

and<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.460> actually<00:05:29.639> decided<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.330> leave<00:05:30.479> all

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
and I actually decided to leave all

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.230 
and I actually decided to leave all
three<00:05:31.020> birds<00:05:31.199> in<00:05:31.469> the<00:05:31.740> house<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:33.060> keep

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
three birds in the house to keep

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:42.330 
three birds in the house to keep
starlings<00:05:33.780> from<00:05:33.960> nesting<00:05:34.319> there<00:05:34.530> again

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.590 

three<00:05:43.340> months<00:05:43.580> later<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:43.850> did<00:05:44.120> return<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.420> this

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
three months later I did return to this

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.240 
three months later I did return to this
area<00:05:44.960> though<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.350> I<00:05:45.410> was<00:05:45.590> curious<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:46.220> see

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
area though and I was curious to see

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.610 
area though and I was curious to see
