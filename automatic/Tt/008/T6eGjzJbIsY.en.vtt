00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.619 
over the silver serum I think it sort of
acts<00:06:18.129> as<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.340> primer<00:06:18.669> anyway<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.300> barrier

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
acts as a primer anyway the barrier

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.529 
acts as a primer anyway the barrier
