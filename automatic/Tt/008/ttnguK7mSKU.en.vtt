okay<00:00:00.659> first<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.319> all<00:00:01.439> before<00:00:02.250> we<00:00:02.460> get<00:00:02.700> into<00:00:03.120> the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay first of all before we get into the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay first of all before we get into the
examples<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.710> want<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> show<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.839> concept

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
examples I want to show you the concept

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.480 
examples I want to show you the concept
behind<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.189> let's<00:00:09.000> go<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.190> B<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
behind it so let's go to the B and the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180 
behind it so let's go to the B and the
high<00:00:11.700> E<00:00:11.730> string<00:00:12.620> we're<00:00:13.620> basically<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:14.130> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
high E string we're basically going to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.960 
high E string we're basically going to
be<00:00:14.250> breaking<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.700> guitar<00:00:15.030> down<00:00:15.770> into<00:00:16.970> two

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
be breaking the guitar down into two

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.500 
be breaking the guitar down into two
string<00:00:18.390> groupings<00:00:19.230> okay<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.510> these

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
string groupings okay and these

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.439 
string groupings okay and these
exercises<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.859> helped<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.910> designed<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
exercises are helped are designed to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.790 
exercises are helped are designed to
help<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.460> see<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.490> guitar<00:00:27.349> scale<00:00:28.349> patterns

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
help you see the guitar scale patterns

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.030 
help you see the guitar scale patterns
in<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.400> more<00:00:29.699> vertical<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> would

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
in a more vertical this is what I would

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000 
in a more vertical this is what I would
be<00:00:32.279> calling<00:00:32.579> vertical<00:00:33.530> vertical<00:00:34.530> fashion

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
be calling vertical vertical fashion

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.720 
be calling vertical vertical fashion
here<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.760> opposed<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> horizontal<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
here as opposed to horizontal and the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
here as opposed to horizontal and the
reason<00:00:39.000> why<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.149> call<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.450> vertical<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
reason why i call this vertical is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
reason why i call this vertical is
because<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.890> far<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.129> pitch<00:00:41.579> goes<00:00:42.000> you're

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
because as far as pitch goes you're

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.459 
because as far as pitch goes you're
going<00:00:42.540> from<00:00:42.809> low<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.500> high<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:45.899> know<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.289> would

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
going from low to high you know we would

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.220 
going from low to high you know we would
be<00:00:46.590> playing<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> guitar<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:48.000> know

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
be playing the guitar like this you know

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.189 
be playing the guitar like this you know
this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.850> going<00:00:50.850> vertically<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
this is you know going vertically up and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.729 
this is you know going vertically up and
down<00:00:53.690> anyhow<00:00:54.690> that's<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
down anyhow that's the way I look at it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.830 
down anyhow that's the way I look at it
so<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:59.899> concept<00:01:00.899> behind<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.770> basically

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
so the concept behind this is basically

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
so the concept behind this is basically
you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.379> were<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.869> stay<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> key

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you know if we were to stay in the key

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.560 
you know if we were to stay in the key
of<00:01:07.290> C<00:01:07.610> okay<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.880> play<00:01:09.200> just<00:01:10.200> scale<00:01:10.799> fragments

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
of C okay and play just scale fragments

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
of C okay and play just scale fragments
okay<00:01:12.570> we'd<00:01:12.780> start<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.770> instance<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
okay we'd start say for instance on the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.530 
okay we'd start say for instance on the
B<00:01:15.150> string<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.140> D<00:01:16.350> note<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.119> we're

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
B string on the D note so if we're

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
B string on the D note so if we're
starting<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> D<00:01:19.619> note<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.400> set

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
starting on the D note that's the set

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.170 
starting on the D note that's the set
second<00:01:21.390> degree<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.409> key<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> C<00:01:23.119> okay<00:01:24.119> so

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
second degree of the key of C okay so

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.380 
second degree of the key of C okay so
that's<00:01:24.540> our<00:01:24.750> modal<00:01:25.170> D<00:01:26.009> Dorian<00:01:26.369> mobile<00:01:27.030> pattern

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that's our modal D Dorian mobile pattern

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's our modal D Dorian mobile pattern
right<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.020> that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.310 

okay<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.310> our<00:01:32.460> next<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.240> he<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
okay and so our next one on he would be

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
okay and so our next one on he would be
from<00:01:34.620> our<00:01:34.860> Phrygian<00:01:35.490> scale<00:01:35.700> pattern<00:01:37.670> ok<00:01:38.670> now

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
from our Phrygian scale pattern ok now

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
from our Phrygian scale pattern ok now
we're<00:01:38.940> not<00:01:39.150> completing<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.780> octave<00:01:40.140> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
we're not completing the octave that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
we're not completing the octave that's
fine<00:01:40.590> okay<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.760> we're<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.150> playing<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
fine okay but we're just playing part of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:57.670 
fine okay but we're just playing part of
the<00:01:42.930> scale<00:01:43.380> fragment<00:01:52.460> anyway<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:55.760> the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
the scale fragment anyway so the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.070 
the scale fragment anyway so the
sequence<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.070> we're<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.550> playing

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
sequence that we're going to be playing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.530 
sequence that we're going to be playing
in<00:02:01.080> these<00:02:01.560> examples<00:02:01.980> is<00:02:02.910> basically<00:02:03.390> we're

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in these examples is basically we're

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.270 
in these examples is basically we're
going<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.720> go<00:02:03.900> up<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.290> scale<00:02:05.190> fragment<00:02:07.250> put<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
going to go up the scale fragment put a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.840 
going to go up the scale fragment put a
row<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.740> remember<00:02:11.130> earlier<00:02:11.640> we

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
row on it do you remember earlier we

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.880 
row on it do you remember earlier we
talked<00:02:12.120> about<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> role<00:02:12.770> ascending<00:02:13.770> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
talked about a role ascending and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.550 
talked about a role ascending and
descending<00:02:14.360> type<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.510> thing<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.870> so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
descending type of thing right so

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.660 
descending type of thing right so
basically<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.130> we're<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.490> doing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
basically what we're going to be doing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.890 
basically what we're going to be doing
is<00:02:20.970> will<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.600> up<00:02:21.720> our<00:02:21.900> scale<00:02:22.170> fragment<00:02:23.660> roll<00:02:24.660> on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
is will go up our scale fragment roll on

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.830 
is will go up our scale fragment roll on
it<00:02:25.080> shift<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.850> play<00:02:27.840> another<00:02:28.080> role<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.600> d

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
it shift and play another role and d

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.280 
it shift and play another role and d
send<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.709> next<00:02:32.300> scale<00:02:33.300> fragment<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:33.959> we<00:02:34.110> have

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
send the next scale fragment so we have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.210 
send the next scale fragment so we have
I<00:02:36.830> believe<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.070> examples<00:02:38.640> I've<00:02:38.850> got<00:02:39.090> them

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I believe in the examples I've got them

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.290 
I believe in the examples I've got them
notated<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.370> where<00:02:41.519> you're<00:02:41.670> playing<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:42.269> of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
notated to where you're playing more of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.250 
notated to where you're playing more of
a<00:02:42.780> legato<00:02:43.530> sound<00:02:44.040> oh<00:02:44.540> look<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.840> technique

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
a legato sound oh look out of technique

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.110

I'm sorry so so you're going to be using
hammer-ons<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.810> pull-offs

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.370

so you're going to have that type of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:16.270 
so you're going to have that type of
sound<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.520> when<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.020> descend<00:03:07.020> you're

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.750

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
roll and go down the next scale Frank so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.390
