00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 good guys welcome back to my channel 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 on the option welcome this brand new 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.010
 I wanted to video gta boys today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 show everything I know about the next one 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 peace or the 1.18 given that lately 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.599
 you ask me a lot of information about it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 especially at a halloween dlc 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.630
 so let's not get lost in small talk 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.550
 let me like the video for 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.320
 support me and subscribe to the channel if 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.130
 you have not already done so and I would say that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 we can start 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 let's start by saying that the picture that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.769
 lately turn to LCDs 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.119
 halloween the one with the mask from 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 pumpkin and a chainsaw 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 for those who do not know it is absolutely 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 false 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 just note the setting behind and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 especially the game graphics that you don't 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.700
 reminds absolutely gta 5 the palms the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 road and the ground are in low 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 resolution for which it is a fake 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 be careful with this however I don't want to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.110
 say there wo n't be a halloween dlc 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.940
 but in my opinion there will be a 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 update that will include elements that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 remember halloween as a state 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 of the Christmas update they have 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.719
 introduced clothes and flies 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.359
 Christmas only for a number of 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 Limited days however will not be a true e 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.110
 its own dlc that will lead to peace 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.729
 later of course this is just the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.420
 my version however there is still nothing 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.880
 of officer 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 there may be do points 18 from 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 how could halloween not put us 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 now nothing we pass instead to 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 what I think could be the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 future dlc which will lead to peace 1.18 s 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 you have searched for some information in 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 around the net you will surely have 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 heard of veteran's day ie 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.640
 an American festivity that all an hour 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 the people who served 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.890
 military to the armed forces of the states 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.509
 united that is celebrated every November 11th e 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.329
 you may be wondering what everything has to do with it 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.310
 this with the 1.18 patch well known 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.439
 moder named chrome mode channel in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.899
 description would have found in delle 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.899
 code strings an alleged dlc that is 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.670
 the name of mp probably arms the name 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.310
 will not be that or at least will not be the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.189
 full name the letters mp I don't know what 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 could mean to mean 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.159
 multiplayer 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 I don't know but those two letters come 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.570
 always before the name of a dlc in the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.619
 code strings as it was for mp 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 indeepandance or mp lts in any case 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.229
 let 's return the code strings and where 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.179
 we find the phrase you see 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.510
 underlined 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.219
 which shortly translated says if mpa 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.959
 years exists there will be 9 tricks 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.269
 military facials available for 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.909
 the purchase and in fact we find the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.659
 code of these mk upi facial tricks 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.859
 weapon 0 than the letters mkp 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.310
 would probably mean make up 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.049
 that is to say makeup but now we see one 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.359
 very interesting thing that chrome already 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.400
 found in the strings would seem to have 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.139
 found a reference to the hydra or if the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.329
 military fighter we had seen in the 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.280
 code strings from the 1.15 patch that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.260
 then it was removed and in my opinion now 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.540
 it's a good time to propose this 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.129
 plane for the veteran's day dlc 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.030
 but let's go and read things report i 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.389
 press input code pieces 2h 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.549
 probably means ave with the vehicle 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.989
 fly vertical flight mode ie a 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.859
 command for flight mode 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.079
 vertical 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.049
 just as a leader in san andreas ea 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.870
 follow we find on tags between cover 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.459
 mode and the normal flight mode ie the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.260
 description of the command it says for 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.750
 switch to flight cover mode 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.069
 I will now explain to you what it is and how 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.870
 normal flight 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.970
 the flight cover mode citing the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.280
 source of wikipedia from English hovering 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.169
 Fixed flight is a maneuver 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.840
 performed by an aircraft often a 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.199
 helicopter consists of sustained flight 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.970
 at zero speed and constant altitude 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.370
 to follow we find the same command with 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.620
 different description all of the vertical 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.060
 flight mode ie to activate or 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.639
 disable flight mode 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.989
 vertical without a doubt this is 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.909
 referring to jazz 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.400
 idra which we hope will be introduced 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.259
 mind the ac weapons or veterans day 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.819
 guys that's all i have 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.620
 discovered for now there is nothing 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.530
 official I do not know that is not much stuff 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.479
 but for now there is only this 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.069
 because it hasn't been released yet 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.439
 nothing like a rock star 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.810
 we await the confirmation of the rock star e 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.680
 what can we say we'll see the guys 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.970
 video ends here 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.159
