00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
spout out into the open and then these

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.840 
spout out into the open and then these
little<00:03:16.030> beds<00:03:16.240> which<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:17.100> made<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.340> two<00:03:18.640> days

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
little beds which I made this two days

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.970 
little beds which I made this two days
before<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.450> update<00:03:19.630> for<00:03:20.080> beds<00:03:20.290> came<00:03:20.590> out<00:03:20.770> and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
before the update for beds came out and

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.230 
before the update for beds came out and
I<00:03:21.040> still<00:03:21.250> haven't<00:03:21.430> replaced<00:03:21.640> them<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.000> real

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
I still haven't replaced them with real

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.500 
I still haven't replaced them with real
beds<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.440> yeah<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.980> stuff<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:25.030> used<00:03:25.330> to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
beds so yeah just stuff that I used to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.810 
beds so yeah just stuff that I used to
build<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.930> place<00:03:26.200> left<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.130> chest<00:03:27.460> I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
build the place left in that chest I

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.700 
build the place left in that chest I
guess<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.780> should<00:03:28.930> probably<00:03:29.050> removed<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
guess I should probably removed the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.400 
guess I should probably removed the
chest<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.460> I<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:31.480> went<00:03:31.720> ahead<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:31.930> left<00:03:32.050> it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
chest but I just went ahead and left it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.460 
chest but I just went ahead and left it
so<00:03:33.370> say<00:03:33.820> somebody<00:03:34.210> would<00:03:34.420> somehow<00:03:34.660> get<00:03:35.080> out<00:03:35.320> of

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
so say somebody would somehow get out of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.630 
so say somebody would somehow get out of
there<00:03:35.770> out<00:03:36.460> of<00:03:37.000> their<00:03:37.180> cell<00:03:38.280> they<00:03:39.280> come<00:03:39.520> up

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
there out of their cell they come up

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.490 
there out of their cell they come up
here<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.630> door<00:03:40.870> would<00:03:41.110> be<00:03:41.140> locked

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
here and that door would be locked

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.220 
here and that door would be locked
because<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.950> locks<00:03:42.220> from<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:43.210> outside<00:03:43.360> that's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
because it locks from the outside that's

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.780 
because it locks from the outside that's
which<00:03:44.470> there's<00:03:44.770> only<00:03:44.920> switch<00:03:45.220> on<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.460> outside

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
which there's only switch on the outside

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
which there's only switch on the outside
but<00:03:46.390> somehow<00:03:47.140> they<00:03:47.530> break<00:03:47.770> outside<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
but somehow they break outside of the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.880 
but somehow they break outside of the
door<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:49.270> then<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.170> wouldn't<00:03:50.500> really<00:03:50.590> see

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
door so then you wouldn't really see

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.350 
door so then you wouldn't really see
these<00:03:51.070> push<00:03:51.370> panels<00:03:51.820> if<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.030> weren't<00:03:52.150> paying

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
these push panels if you weren't paying

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.850 
these push panels if you weren't paying
attention<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:53.020> know<00:03:53.170> you're<00:03:53.380> breaking<00:03:53.740> out

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
attention you know you're breaking out

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.890 
attention you know you're breaking out
of<00:03:53.890> prison<00:03:54.010> they<00:03:54.670> kind<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.940> blend<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.540> with<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
of prison they kind of blend in with the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.590 
of prison they kind of blend in with the
floor<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.010> kind<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.280> walk<00:03:57.490> out<00:03:57.760> step<00:03:58.480> on

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
floor so you kind of walk out step on

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.190 
floor so you kind of walk out step on
one<00:03:58.750> of<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.960> push<00:03:59.140> panels<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.520> then<00:04:01.450> an<00:04:01.690> alarm

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
one of the push panels and then an alarm

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.740 
one of the push panels and then an alarm
is<00:04:02.440> activated<00:04:02.590> back<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.550> city<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.570> gotta

is activated back in the city you gotta
think<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.080> actually<00:04:05.230> mighty<00:04:06.420> anomaly<00:04:07.420> okay

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
think I actually mighty anomaly okay

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.120 
think I actually mighty anomaly okay
okay<00:04:10.270> it<00:04:10.480> should<00:04:10.510> be<00:04:10.690> going<00:04:10.960> off<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:11.950> can

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
okay it should be going off so you can

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.930 
okay it should be going off so you can
see<00:04:12.460> that<00:04:13.080> all<00:04:14.080> of<00:04:14.110> them<00:04:14.410> are<00:04:14.590> connected<00:04:15.100> under

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
see that all of them are connected under

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.080 
see that all of them are connected under
here<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:17.260> all<00:04:17.410> go<00:04:17.680> down<00:04:17.830> this<00:04:18.040> wire<00:04:18.280> which

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
here they all go down this wire which

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.620 
here they all go down this wire which
these<00:04:19.359> are<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.720> repeaters<00:04:20.730> which<00:04:21.730> it

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
these are the repeaters which it

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.810 
these are the repeaters which it
basically<00:04:23.290> switches<00:04:23.800> them<00:04:23.980> from<00:04:24.220> live<00:04:24.460> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
basically switches them from live to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.560 
basically switches them from live to
dead<00:04:25.060> too

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
dead too

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
dead too
head<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.930> live<00:04:26.910> wiring<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.920> this<00:04:29.920> makes<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.370> so

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
head to live wiring and this makes it so

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.150 
head to live wiring and this makes it so
you<00:04:30.610> can<00:04:30.820> make<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.360> redstone<00:04:31.990> wire<00:04:32.230> as<00:04:32.560> long

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
you can make the redstone wire as long

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680 
you can make the redstone wire as long
as<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.490> want<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:33.910> don't<00:04:34.000> have<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.330> stay

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
noise okay did I hit this button and it

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.610 
noise okay did I hit this button and it
will<00:05:04.690> reset<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:07.210> also<00:05:07.570> resets<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.380> pressure

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
will reset that also resets the pressure

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.760 
will reset that also resets the pressure
plates<00:05:09.010> back<00:05:09.280> there

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.980 

I'll<00:05:15.400> go<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.669> seal<00:05:15.970> myself<00:05:16.360> down<00:05:16.539> here<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:16.870> no

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
I'll go and seal myself down here so no

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.249 
I'll go and seal myself down here so no
sheep<00:05:17.259> will<00:05:17.470> get<00:05:17.620> down<00:05:17.770> here<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:19.449> basically<00:05:20.050> it

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
sheep will get down here so basically it

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.360 
sheep will get down here so basically it
comes<00:05:20.319> down<00:05:20.650> here<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:22.539> it<00:05:23.199> goes<00:05:23.470> through<00:05:23.800> this

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
comes down here and it goes through this

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.480 
comes down here and it goes through this
repeater<00:05:24.879> to<00:05:25.720> go<00:05:25.900> into<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:28.050> reset<00:05:29.050> button<00:05:29.490> but

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
repeater to go into the reset button but

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.180 
repeater to go into the reset button but
this<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:32.710> wire<00:05:33.659> branches<00:05:34.659> off<00:05:34.840> into<00:05:35.199> this

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
this this wire branches off into this

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.580 
this this wire branches off into this
repeater<00:05:36.669> which<00:05:36.759> also<00:05:37.300> branches<00:05:38.110> off<00:05:38.289> from

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
repeater which also branches off from

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.680 
repeater which also branches off from
the<00:05:39.129> repeater<00:05:39.909> now<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.389> really

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
the repeater now this is really

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.779 
the repeater now this is really
complicated<00:05:41.139> with<00:05:41.650> me<00:05:41.889> just<00:05:42.099> explaining<00:05:42.520> it

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
complicated with me just explaining it

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.339 
complicated with me just explaining it
like<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.150> I'd<00:05:43.539> have<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.870> make<00:05:44.020> a<00:05:44.050> whole

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
like this I'd have to make a whole

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.580 
like this I'd have to make a whole
separate<00:05:44.830> video<00:05:45.159> if<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.520> wanted<00:05:45.849> a<00:05:46.409> if<00:05:47.409> you

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
separate video if you wanted a if you

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.080 
separate video if you wanted a if you
wanted<00:05:47.949> a<00:05:48.099> tutorial<00:05:48.659> so<00:05:49.659> here<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:51.090> it's

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
wanted a tutorial so here is the it's

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.300 
wanted a tutorial so here is the it's
called<00:05:52.300> like<00:05:52.479> an<00:05:52.630> RS<00:05:52.990> no<00:05:53.349> lakhs<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:53.919> something

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
called like an RS no lakhs or something

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.020 
called like an RS no lakhs or something
I<00:05:54.490> saw<00:05:55.210> this<00:05:55.360> on<00:05:55.509> some<00:05:55.690> other<00:05:55.870> guys<00:05:56.080> video<00:05:56.470> and

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
I saw this on some other guys video and

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.399 
I saw this on some other guys video and
mine<00:05:58.030> my<00:05:58.479> alarm<00:05:58.720> works<00:05:58.990> a<00:05:59.110> little<00:05:59.199> bit

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
mine my alarm works a little bit

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.559 
mine my alarm works a little bit
different<00:05:59.830> than<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.370> kind<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.000> was<00:06:01.210> going<00:06:01.479> to

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
different than is I kind of was going to

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.080 
different than is I kind of was going to
make<00:06:01.720> his<00:06:01.930> but<00:06:02.169> then<00:06:02.349> it<00:06:02.979> wasn't<00:06:03.400> working<00:06:03.759> when

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
make his but then it wasn't working when

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
make his but then it wasn't working when
I<00:06:04.120> made<00:06:04.389> his<00:06:04.710> because<00:06:05.710> of<00:06:05.830> my<00:06:05.979> repeaters<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:08.080> I

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
I made his because of my repeaters so I

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.640 
I made his because of my repeaters so I
had<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.530> kind<00:06:09.099> of<00:06:09.430> change<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:09.909> design<00:06:10.180> so<00:06:10.930> this

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
had to kind of change the design so this

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.459 
had to kind of change the design so this
one<00:06:11.979> goes<00:06:12.310> to<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.610> switch<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.750> turns<00:06:14.169> it<00:06:14.379> on

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
one goes to the switch that turns it on

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:19.800 
one goes to the switch that turns it on
and<00:06:14.530> off<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.990> goes<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:18.129> the<00:06:18.810> pressure

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
and off and this goes to the pressure

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.950 
and off and this goes to the pressure
button<00:06:20.289> and<00:06:20.759> then<00:06:21.759> so<00:06:22.479> after<00:06:22.599> it<00:06:22.840> comes

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
button and then so after it comes

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.350 
button and then so after it comes
through<00:06:23.229> the<00:06:23.349> Arsenal<00:06:23.919> latch<00:06:24.130> thing<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:25.150> hits

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
through the Arsenal latch thing it hits

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.480 
through the Arsenal latch thing it hits
a<00:06:25.479> repeater<00:06:25.840> ah<00:06:26.729> geez<00:06:27.729> turning<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.780> wire<00:06:29.020> on

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
a repeater ah geez turning the wire on

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.040 
a repeater ah geez turning the wire on
and<00:06:30.490> it<00:06:31.479> then<00:06:31.990> makes<00:06:32.590> this<00:06:32.919> start<00:06:33.279> going<00:06:33.699> off

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
and it then makes this start going off

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.730 
and it then makes this start going off
and<00:06:35.250> making<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.490> lights<00:06:36.729> flash<00:06:37.409> makes<00:06:38.409> this

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
and making the lights flash makes this

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.240 
and making the lights flash makes this
flash<00:06:39.479> making<00:06:40.479> this<00:06:40.659> go<00:06:41.020> on<00:06:41.259> and<00:06:41.680> off<00:06:41.889> like

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
flash making this go on and off like

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.570 
flash making this go on and off like
this<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:42.870> i<00:06:43.870> already<00:06:44.080> showed<00:06:44.889> you<00:06:44.949> it<00:06:45.370> and
