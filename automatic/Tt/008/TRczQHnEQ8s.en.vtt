showing<00:00:16.180> you<00:00:16.270> guys<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.420> strategy<00:00:16.900> for<00:00:16.930> that<00:00:17.200> map

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
showing you guys a strategy for that map

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.109 
showing you guys a strategy for that map
so<00:00:17.590> if<00:00:17.680> you<00:00:17.770> haven't<00:00:18.040> seen<00:00:18.130> that<00:00:18.189> check<00:00:18.910> it<00:00:19.029> out

so if you haven't seen that check it out
I'll<00:00:19.420> put<00:00:19.570> an<00:00:19.660> annotation<00:00:19.779> on<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.230> screen

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
I'll put an annotation on the screen

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.070 
I'll put an annotation on the screen
right<00:00:20.560> now<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.910> this<00:00:22.570> video<00:00:22.690> I'm<00:00:22.930> going<00:00:23.020> to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
show you guys a strategy for this mount

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.670 
show you guys a strategy for this mount
parish<00:00:24.820> so<00:00:25.119> this<00:00:25.690> is<00:00:25.720> actually<00:00:25.990> my<00:00:26.260> second

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
parish so this is actually my second

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.200 
parish so this is actually my second
time<00:00:26.770> playing<00:00:27.039> this<00:00:27.100> map<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.580> first<00:00:27.820> time<00:00:28.029> was

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
time playing this map the first time was

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.000 
time playing this map the first time was
a<00:00:28.270> disaster<00:00:28.840> i<00:00:28.869> got<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.170> lot<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.410> deaths<00:00:29.710> but<00:00:29.949> I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
a disaster i got a lot of deaths but I

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.670 
a disaster i got a lot of deaths but I
still<00:00:30.220> won<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.520> match<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.260> it<00:00:32.349> took<00:00:32.439> me<00:00:32.590> like

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
still won the match so it took me like

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.200 
still won the match so it took me like
the<00:00:32.830> full<00:00:33.070> game<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.489> figure<00:00:33.699> out<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.850> spawns

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
the full game to figure out the spawns

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.049 
the full game to figure out the spawns
but<00:00:34.590> at<00:00:35.590> this<00:00:35.769> point<00:00:35.980> my<00:00:36.220> second<00:00:36.699> time<00:00:36.790> playing

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
but at this point my second time playing

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.549 
but at this point my second time playing
this<00:00:37.150> map<00:00:37.330> I've<00:00:37.570> already<00:00:37.780> figured<00:00:38.020> out<00:00:38.230> most

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
this map I've already figured out most

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.650 
this map I've already figured out most
of<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.800> spawns<00:00:39.100> they're<00:00:39.370> really<00:00:39.670> crazy<00:00:39.940> um

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
of the spawns they're really crazy um

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.870 
of the spawns they're really crazy um
they<00:00:41.230> didn't<00:00:41.470> think<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.770> spawns<00:00:42.040> out<00:00:42.250> got

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
they didn't think the spawns out got

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.790 
they didn't think the spawns out got
well<00:00:43.090> in<00:00:43.239> this<00:00:43.329> map<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.750> you'll<00:00:44.469> notice<00:00:44.770> that

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
well in this map and you'll notice that

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.590 
well in this map and you'll notice that
I'm<00:00:45.040> staying<00:00:45.340> in<00:00:45.489> a<00:00:45.579> lower<00:00:45.760> traffic<00:00:46.120> area<00:00:46.510> of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
I'm staying in a lower traffic area of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.630 
I'm staying in a lower traffic area of
the<00:00:46.690> map<00:00:46.840> then<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.590> would<00:00:47.649> on<00:00:48.070> other<00:00:48.399> maps

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
the map then I would on other maps

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.020 
the map then I would on other maps
because<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.600> spawns<00:00:49.930> are<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:50.550> hectic<00:00:51.550> on<00:00:51.879> this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
because the spawns are so hectic on this

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.119 
because the spawns are so hectic on this
map<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.750> can't<00:00:53.050> stay<00:00:53.410> in<00:00:53.649> a

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
map that you can't stay in a

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.010 
map that you can't stay in a
high-traffic<00:00:54.340> area<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.239> I'm<00:00:55.450> staying<00:00:55.750> in<00:00:55.930> a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
high-traffic area so I'm staying in a

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.080 
high-traffic area so I'm staying in a
lower<00:00:56.770> traffic<00:00:57.070> area<00:00:57.399> because<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.789> makes<00:00:57.940> it

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
lower traffic area because that makes it

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.090 
lower traffic area because that makes it
manageable<00:00:58.510> if<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.559> want<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.800> go<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.039> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
manageable if you want to go in a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.860 
manageable if you want to go in a
high-traffic<00:01:00.309> area<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.149> might<00:01:01.480> be<00:01:01.629> better<00:01:01.750> to

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
high-traffic area it might be better to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.750 
high-traffic area it might be better to
get<00:01:02.140> montage<00:01:02.890> clips<00:01:03.190> like<00:01:03.309> if<00:01:03.460> you're<00:01:03.579> going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
get montage clips like if you're going

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.730 
get montage clips like if you're going
for<00:01:03.969> quad<00:01:04.180> feeds<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.600> free<00:01:04.780> throw<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.590> might

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
for quad feeds in free throw you might

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.840 
for quad feeds in free throw you might
want<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:05.950> be<00:01:06.039> on<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.250> other<00:01:06.369> side<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.729> map

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
want to be on the other side of the map

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.859 
want to be on the other side of the map
there<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.149> way<00:01:07.750> more<00:01:07.780> spawns<00:01:08.259> on<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.590> side

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
there is way more spawns on that side

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.790 
there is way more spawns on that side
the<00:01:10.869> reason<00:01:11.080> I'm<00:01:11.170> on<00:01:11.259> this<00:01:11.319> side<00:01:11.470> those

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
the reason I'm on this side those

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.070 
the reason I'm on this side those
because<00:01:12.220> if<00:01:12.910> there's<00:01:13.240> too<00:01:13.450> many<00:01:13.569> people<00:01:13.929> all

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
because if there's too many people all

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.300 
because if there's too many people all
around<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.470> like<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.770> other<00:01:14.920> side<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
around you like the other side of the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.499 
around you like the other side of the
map<00:01:15.459> there's<00:01:15.729> just<00:01:15.940> too<00:01:16.060> many<00:01:16.149> directions

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
map there's just too many directions

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.109 
map there's just too many directions
that<00:01:16.780> they<00:01:16.810> can<00:01:17.020> come<00:01:17.200> from<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.340> it's<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.940> too

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
that they can come from so it's just too

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.430 
that they can come from so it's just too
much<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.300> handle<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.840> end<00:01:19.959> up<00:01:20.080> getting<00:01:20.200> too

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
much to handle you end up getting too

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.779 
much to handle you end up getting too
many<00:01:20.560> deaths<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.130> what<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.369> like<00:01:21.550> about<00:01:21.580> this

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
many deaths so what I like about this

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.570 
many deaths so what I like about this
side<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.899> there's<00:01:23.560> only<00:01:23.770> about<00:01:24.009> four

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
side is that there's only about four

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.350 
side is that there's only about four
spawns<00:01:24.970> near<00:01:25.330> me<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:27.759> enough<00:01:28.090> cover

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
spawns near me and there's enough cover

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480 
spawns near me and there's enough cover
back<00:01:28.599> here<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.050> you're<00:01:29.950> not<00:01:30.069> going<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.340> get

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
back here that you're not going to get

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.520 
back here that you're not going to get
shot<00:01:31.179> at<00:01:31.330> by<00:01:31.360> multiple<00:01:31.899> enemies<00:01:32.170> at<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.380> same

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
shot at by multiple enemies at the same

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.710 
shot at by multiple enemies at the same
time<00:01:32.679> that's<00:01:32.950> really<00:01:33.190> important<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.789> right

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
time that's really important and right

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.059 
time that's really important and right
here<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.080> really<00:01:35.319> dangerous<00:01:35.590> part<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
here is a really dangerous part of the

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.620 
here is a really dangerous part of the
map<00:01:36.190> there's<00:01:36.520> way<00:01:36.759> too<00:01:36.789> many<00:01:37.060> spawns<00:01:37.390> over

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
map there's way too many spawns over

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.570 
map there's way too many spawns over
here<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:37.959> if<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.229> are<00:01:38.890> over<00:01:39.160> there<00:01:39.280> try<00:01:39.550> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
here so if you are over there try and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.100 
here so if you are over there try and
get<00:01:39.759> out<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.970> there<00:01:40.000> alive<00:01:40.179> if<00:01:40.599> you<00:01:41.080> can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
get out of there alive if you can

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.870 
get out of there alive if you can
obviously<00:01:41.470> there<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.160> wasn't<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:42.759> lucky

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
obviously there I wasn't so lucky

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.919 
obviously there I wasn't so lucky
because<00:01:43.060> there's<00:01:43.390> just<00:01:43.599> too<00:01:43.720> many<00:01:43.810> people

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
because there's just too many people

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.210 
because there's just too many people
spawning<00:01:44.380> around<00:01:44.619> there<00:01:44.709> it's<00:01:44.830> really<00:01:45.069> hard

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
spawning around there it's really hard

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.029 
spawning around there it's really hard
to<00:01:45.369> stay<00:01:45.520> alive<00:01:46.259> right<00:01:47.259> here<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.590> also<00:01:47.770> quite

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
to stay alive right here is also quite

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.460 
to stay alive right here is also quite
dangerous<00:01:48.280> there's<00:01:48.929> see<00:01:49.929> they<00:01:50.080> spawn<00:01:50.349> behind

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
dangerous there's see they spawn behind

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.050 
dangerous there's see they spawn behind
you<00:01:50.770> they<00:01:50.890> also<00:01:51.039> spawn<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.489> your<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.789> there

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
you they also spawn on your right there

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.180 
you they also spawn on your right there
and<00:01:52.300> as<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.319> can<00:01:53.440> see<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.800> keep<00:01:53.979> spawning

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
and as you can see that keep spawning

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.240 
and as you can see that keep spawning
behind<00:01:54.580> me<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.440> if<00:01:56.440> you're<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.709> this<00:01:56.800> area<00:01:57.009> it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
behind me so if you're in this area it's

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.440 
behind me so if you're in this area it's
really<00:01:57.489> dangerous<00:01:57.610> trying<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.179> stay<00:01:58.300> out<00:01:58.330> of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
really dangerous trying to stay out of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.820 
really dangerous trying to stay out of
there<00:01:58.599> this<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.080> where<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.349> want<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.619> be

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
there this is where you want to be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.960 
there this is where you want to be
people<00:02:01.830> can<00:02:02.010> stand<00:02:02.190> behind<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.550> crate<00:02:02.850> there

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
people can stand behind that crate there

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.600 
people can stand behind that crate there
and<00:02:03.180> clip<00:02:03.770> behind<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.190> really<00:02:05.340> hard

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and clip behind it so it's really hard

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.220 
and clip behind it so it's really hard
to<00:02:05.940> kill<00:02:06.300> them<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> spawn<00:02:06.870> there<00:02:07.050> as<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
to kill them as you spawn there as you

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.780 
to kill them as you spawn there as you
can<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.650> guy<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.070> huge<00:02:08.400> advantage

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
can see this guy as a huge advantage

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.100 
can see this guy as a huge advantage
over<00:02:08.880> me<00:02:09.119> eventually<00:02:09.930> I<00:02:09.990> get<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.320> but<00:02:10.530> um

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
over me eventually I get them but um

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.390 
over me eventually I get them but um
what<00:02:13.110> sucks<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> die<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.190> map

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
what sucks is when you die on this map

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670 
what sucks is when you die on this map
you're<00:02:15.330> probably<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.930> die<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.320> two<00:02:16.530> or

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
you're probably going to die like two or

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.170 
you're probably going to die like two or
three<00:02:16.710> more<00:02:16.980> times<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.970> spawns

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
three more times just because the spawns

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
three more times just because the spawns
are<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.480> bad<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.950> said<00:02:20.010> at<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
are so bad so like I said at the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280 
are so bad so like I said at the
beginning<00:02:20.370> stay<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.360> low<00:02:21.660> traffic<00:02:21.960> side

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
beginning stay on that low traffic side

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
beginning stay on that low traffic side
of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> map<00:02:22.590> right<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:24.420> try<00:02:24.660> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
of the map right here and just try and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440 
of the map right here and just try and
stay<00:02:24.990> alive<00:02:25.110> because<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.580> die<00:02:26.820> you're

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
stay alive because if you die you're

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.060 
stay alive because if you die you're
going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.630> keep<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.080> dying<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.590> want<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> stay

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
going to keep on dying you want to stay

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
going to keep on dying you want to stay
here<00:02:29.370> make<00:02:29.970> sure<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:31.110> watch<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.530> one

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
here make sure that you watch this one

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.930 
here make sure that you watch this one
and<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.750> spawn<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> other<00:02:34.500> side<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:35.070> that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and the spawn on the other side of that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.320 
and the spawn on the other side of that
little<00:02:36.300> whatever<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:37.590> thing<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:39.300> just

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
little whatever this thing is you just

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.750 
little whatever this thing is you just
go<00:02:39.870> back<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.320> forth<00:02:40.500> keep<00:02:41.070> working<00:02:41.250> those<00:02:41.550> two

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
go back and forth keep working those two

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.570 
go back and forth keep working those two
spawns<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.810> should<00:02:43.050> be<00:02:43.080> alright<00:02:43.680> like

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
spawns and you should be alright like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.070 
spawns and you should be alright like
here<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.450> spawn<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.840> pairs

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
here you can see they spawn in pairs

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 
here you can see they spawn in pairs
it's<00:02:46.320> ridiculous<00:02:46.800> they<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.220> put<00:02:48.210> way<00:02:48.480> too

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it's ridiculous they just put way too

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.630 
it's ridiculous they just put way too
much<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.260> high<00:02:49.380> priority<00:02:49.620> spawn<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.310> they

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
much of a high priority spawn there they

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.450 
much of a high priority spawn there they
shouldn't<00:02:51.680> okay<00:02:52.680> when<00:02:52.860> they're<00:02:52.980> making<00:02:53.250> maps

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
shouldn't okay when they're making maps

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.760 
shouldn't okay when they're making maps
they<00:02:54.420> give<00:02:54.780> they<00:02:55.290> assign<00:02:55.620> different

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
they give they assign different

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.830 
they give they assign different
priorities<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> different<00:02:56.820> spawns<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
priorities to different spawns and the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
priorities to different spawns and the
one<00:02:57.990> behind<00:02:58.140> me<00:02:58.410> there<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.820> highest

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
one behind me there is the highest

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.810 
one behind me there is the highest
priority<00:03:00.540> spawn<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.080> map<00:03:01.610> let's<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.730> if

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
priority spawn on this map let's see if

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.340 
priority spawn on this map let's see if
I<00:03:02.940> walk<00:03:03.150> over<00:03:03.360> there<00:03:03.510> yeah<00:03:03.660> where<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.230> guy

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
I walk over there yeah where that guy

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.840 
I walk over there yeah where that guy
just<00:03:04.410> came<00:03:04.680> from<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.070> highest<00:03:05.250> priority

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
just came from as the highest priority

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.000 
just came from as the highest priority
spawn<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.330> map<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.080> that's<00:03:07.709> why<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
spawn on this map so that's why I like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.979 
spawn on this map so that's why I like
to<00:03:08.280> stick<00:03:08.820> around<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.209> because<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
to stick around here because I know that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.080 
to stick around here because I know that
they're<00:03:10.200> really<00:03:10.470> often<00:03:10.739> when<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.910> somebody

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
they're really often when I see somebody

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
they're really often when I see somebody
in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.330> killfeed<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.080> check<00:03:13.290> over<00:03:13.470> there

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
in the killfeed I if I check over there

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.370 
in the killfeed I if I check over there
they're<00:03:13.739> most<00:03:13.920> likely<00:03:14.010> going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.459> there

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
they're most likely going to be there

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.660 
they're most likely going to be there
the<00:03:16.380> reason<00:03:16.620> why<00:03:16.739> they<00:03:16.890> might<00:03:17.070> not<00:03:17.310> spawn

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the reason why they might not spawn

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.729 
the reason why they might not spawn
there<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:17.940> if<00:03:18.090> I'm<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.270> bit<00:03:18.600> too<00:03:18.750> close<00:03:19.020> but

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
there is if I'm a bit too close but

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.070 
there is if I'm a bit too close but
still<00:03:20.300> when<00:03:21.300> you're<00:03:21.420> playing<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.720> map<00:03:21.900> i'm

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
sure you'll see people spawn right in

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.160 
sure you'll see people spawn right in

first time I played I got kind of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.120 
first time I played I got kind of
