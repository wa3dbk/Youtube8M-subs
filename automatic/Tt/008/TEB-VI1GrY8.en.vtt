my other secret jets and nose designs

my other secret jets and nose designs
different<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.330> this<00:00:42.660> area's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
different and this is this area's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.830 
different and this is this area's
different<00:00:43.380> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.070> tail<00:00:44.310> fins<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
different and the tail fins are kind of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.420 
different and the tail fins are kind of
futuristic<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.470> kind<00:00:46.650> of<00:00:46.710> supposed<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.250> look

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
futuristic they kind of supposed to look

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.620 
futuristic they kind of supposed to look
like

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
like

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.940 
like
I<00:00:48.890> guess<00:00:49.890> rays<00:00:50.130> of<00:00:50.370> sunshine<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.740> thing

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
I guess rays of sunshine the other thing

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.680 
I guess rays of sunshine the other thing
you'll<00:00:53.070> notice<00:00:53.340> too<00:00:53.700> instead<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> null<00:00:54.420> rays

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you'll notice too instead of null rays

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
you'll notice too instead of null rays
or<00:00:55.050> missile<00:00:55.620> launchers<00:00:56.040> he<00:00:56.520> has

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
or missile launchers he has

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.750 
or missile launchers he has
flamethrowers<00:00:57.630> here<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.200> his<00:00:58.800> own<00:00:59.040> oil<00:00:59.490> which

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
flamethrowers here on his own oil which

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760 
flamethrowers here on his own oil which
will<00:00:59.880> become<00:01:00.180> his<00:01:00.360> arms<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.810> his<00:01:00.960> robot<00:01:01.320> mode

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
will become his arms in his robot mode

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
will become his arms in his robot mode
so<00:01:02.190> let's<00:01:02.490> not<00:01:02.610> waste<00:01:02.760> too<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:02.970> time<00:01:03.120> those

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so let's not waste too much time those

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.419 
so let's not waste too much time those
are<00:01:04.079> the<00:01:04.259> kind<00:01:04.469> of<00:01:04.559> improvements<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.189> my

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:05.429 
are the kind of improvements over my

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.330 
are the kind of improvements over my
secret<00:01:05.820> jet<00:01:06.030> design<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.719> mean<00:01:07.439> upgrade<00:01:08.009> some<00:01:08.219> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
secret jet design I mean upgrade some of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.440 
secret jet design I mean upgrade some of
my<00:01:08.549> older<00:01:09.119> ones<00:01:09.359> to<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.469> as<00:01:10.710> well

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450

my older ones to look like this as well
this<00:01:12.450> piece<00:01:12.719> is<00:01:12.899> on<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.079> ratchet<00:01:13.499> roid<00:01:13.619> which

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this piece is on a ratchet roid which

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
this piece is on a ratchet roid which
actually<00:01:14.159> holds<00:01:14.429> everything<00:01:14.640> nicer<00:01:15.409> than<00:01:16.409> my

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
actually holds everything nicer than my

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.660 
actually holds everything nicer than my
old<00:01:16.859> design<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:18.149> in<00:01:18.329> all<00:01:19.189> I'm<00:01:20.189> trying<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
old design but all in all I'm trying to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
old design but all in all I'm trying to
keep<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> theme<00:01:21.899> here<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.130> guy

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369

keep with the theme here with this guy
he<00:01:23.729> does<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> little<00:01:24.420> futuristic<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
he does look a little futuristic and

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.440 
he does look a little futuristic and
does<00:01:27.569> indeed<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> top<00:01:29.729> top<00:01:30.149> for<00:01:30.389> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
does indeed just get a top top for you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.239 
does indeed just get a top top for you
there<00:01:31.729> he<00:01:32.729> does<00:01:32.969> indeed<00:01:33.920> transform<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.069> same

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
there he does indeed transform the same

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:36.709 
there he does indeed transform the same
as<00:01:35.369> me<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.700> guys<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.270> obviously<00:01:36.630> some

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
as me other guys with obviously some

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.739 
as me other guys with obviously some
modifications<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.100> let's<00:01:38.969> get<00:01:39.539> right<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
modifications so let's get right to

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.660 
modifications so let's get right to
transformation<00:01:40.649> and<00:01:40.889> I'll<00:01:41.069> back<00:01:41.219> camera<00:01:41.609> up

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
transformation and I'll back camera up

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
transformation and I'll back camera up
if<00:01:41.789> we<00:01:41.939> need<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.139> first<00:01:43.380> thing<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> we

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.779 
a standing position and we'll take out
what<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.609> become<00:01:50.939> his<00:01:51.090> legs<00:01:51.359> like<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.789> I'm

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.280 
that like my other designs the first
thing<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.529> move<00:02:08.159> these<00:02:08.399> pins

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
thing you want to do is move these pins

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.000 
thing you want to do is move these pins
you<00:02:11.290> can<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.680> on<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.890> sides<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.400> legs<00:02:14.010> on

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you can see on the sides of the legs on

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.250 
you can see on the sides of the legs on
each<00:02:15.250> side<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.330> we're<00:02:16.510> going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.810> both<00:02:17.080> at

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
each side and we're going to do both at

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.900 
each side and we're going to do both at
the<00:02:17.350> same<00:02:17.590> time<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:18.460> we<00:02:18.550> can<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.790> them

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
the same time just so we can get them

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.000 
the same time just so we can get them
out<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.180> even<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> what<00:02:21.760> we<00:02:21.880> want<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> do<00:02:23.010> get

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
out and even so what we want to do get

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.880 
out and even so what we want to do get
to<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> other<00:02:24.520> side<00:02:25.030> here<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.170> remove<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
to the other side here and remove the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.770 
to the other side here and remove the
pin<00:02:27.570> okay

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
pin okay

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.650 
pin okay
so<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.860> got<00:02:29.980> them<00:02:30.130> both<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:31.180> top<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
so then we got them both out the top and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.140 
so then we got them both out the top and
the<00:02:31.780> bottom<00:02:31.930> pin<00:02:32.320> as<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.640> then

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the bottom pin as you can see and then

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.860 
the bottom pin as you can see and then
we<00:02:34.270> want<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.570> drop<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.260> legs<00:02:35.500> out<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:37.510> about

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
we want to drop the legs out to about

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.500 
we want to drop the legs out to about
there

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
there

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.970 
there
no<00:02:40.510> not<00:02:40.840> that's<00:02:41.110> too<00:02:41.440> far<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:44.380> want<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.770> drop

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
no not that's too far you want to drop

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.010 
no not that's too far you want to drop
the<00:02:45.040> legs<00:02:45.550> out<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.620> they<00:02:47.770> go<00:02:48.810> into<00:02:49.810> those

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
the legs out so that they go into those

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.640 
the legs out so that they go into those
sockets<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.370> got<00:02:51.520> one<00:02:52.440> sometimes<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
sockets so we got one sometimes it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.620 
sockets so we got one sometimes it
happens<00:02:54.070> very<00:02:54.160> easily<00:02:54.430> sometimes<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.480> does

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
happens very easily sometimes it does

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.220 
happens very easily sometimes it does
not<00:02:55.810> okay<00:02:56.560> what<00:02:56.770> we're<00:02:56.920> in<00:02:57.100> okay<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.020> next

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
different from my other seekers I did

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.220 
different from my other seekers I did
use<00:04:00.870> minifig<00:04:01.870> hands<00:04:02.850> as<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.480> fingers<00:04:04.840> instead

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
use minifig hands as the fingers instead

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.930 
use minifig hands as the fingers instead
of<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.530> usual<00:04:05.680> pieces<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.400> use<00:04:06.670> for<00:04:06.880> my

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
of the usual pieces that I use for my

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.120 
of the usual pieces that I use for my
hands<00:04:07.390> but<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.930> looks<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.200> same<00:04:08.440> JEP<00:04:08.799> see<00:04:08.950> has

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
hands but it looks the same JEP see has

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.710 
hands but it looks the same JEP see has
three<00:04:10.320> fingers<00:04:11.320> now<00:04:11.709> instead<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.250> four<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.180> we

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
three fingers now instead of four and we

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.600 
three fingers now instead of four and we
just<00:04:13.900> do<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.140> on<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.380> side<00:04:14.620> oops<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.340> popped

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
just do that on the side oops I popped

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.970 
just do that on the side oops I popped
his<00:04:15.760> hand<00:04:15.940> off

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
his hand off

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
transform the middle section will

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.510 
transform the middle section will
transform<00:04:26.660> similar<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> toy<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:28.250> want<00:04:28.430> to

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
transform similar to the toy we want to

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.750 
transform similar to the toy we want to
turn<00:04:28.670> this<00:04:28.760> guy<00:04:29.000> around<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:30.040> want<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.100> undo<00:04:31.580> this

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
made a display stand so he can always be

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.010 
made a display stand so he can always be
standing<00:05:13.190> solidus<00:05:13.640> or<00:05:14.360> he<00:05:14.570> looks<00:05:14.690> like<00:05:14.840> he's

you<00:06:00.290> can<00:06:00.590> see<00:06:00.800> here<00:06:01.360> fully<00:06:02.380> articulated<00:06:03.380> again

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
you can see here fully articulated again

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.440 
you can see here fully articulated again
very<00:06:04.160> close<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.790> design<00:06:05.030> -<00:06:05.210> my<00:06:05.330> other

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
very close to the design - my other

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.280 
very close to the design - my other
secret<00:06:05.720> Jets<00:06:06.910> and<00:06:07.910> again<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.840> difference<00:06:09.140> is

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
secret Jets and again the difference is

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.540 
secret Jets and again the difference is
flamethrower<00:06:10.390> obviously<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.479> color<00:06:11.690> scheme

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
flamethrower obviously the color scheme

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.920 
flamethrower obviously the color scheme
the<00:06:13.550> tail<00:06:13.760> fins<00:06:14.120> the<00:06:14.510> feet<00:06:14.750> are<00:06:14.870> a<00:06:14.900> little

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
the tail fins the feet are a little

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.420 
the tail fins the feet are a little
different<00:06:15.320> and<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.470> booster<00:06:15.830> rockets<00:06:16.220> at<00:06:16.340> the

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
different and the booster rockets at the
