00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello how are you welcome to our 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.430
 channel 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 I am Adriana Luciana's mom and 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.429
 I am also a child psychologist this channel 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.070
 not only about the tutorials that Luciana 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.949
 do with so much love for you but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
 also about its upbringing and development 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.750
 same as our blog if you do not know it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 I leave the link in the box 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 descriptions so you go and do not read 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:34.980
 with us more about us in the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.469
 this time I will present 5 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
 final psychomotor activities 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.420
 so they can do them with their 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.579
 children in casa luciana is in third of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 preschool and is in the process of 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 acquisition of literacy in this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 process are put into play very many 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 skills and one of the skills that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 I observe that it is important to reinforce 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.740
 Luciana is fine motor and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.170
 what 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.720
 She does a little work 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.700
 everything that has to do with space 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.650
 the organization so I'm going to 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.600
 present these activities I hope that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.910
 are useful to you if your child 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.980
 you are already reading and writing but 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.320
 you notice that they do not have very good lyrics 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.510
 it is recommended that you do this type of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.350
 activities with him and please any 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 doubt or question 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:28.770
 activity number 1 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.670
 we need beads and cards 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.670
 to thread 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.780
 to increase the degree of difficulty of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.659
 involve other skills such as 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 sequencing and organization I asked 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.810
 Luciana following a color pattern 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.569
 leaving the pattern in your sight at least is 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.549
 what I know she can achieve with 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.700
 Larger or more skillful children 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.399
 they can just dictate the pattern and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.670
 try that the child of the single idea what 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.900
 remember 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.900
 let's see how it goes 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.200
 Self-correction is very important 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.600
 because that way the child gets used to self 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.760
 be verified and not depend on the adult 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.470
 to know if it is right or wrong 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 what he is doing 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.920
 the insert may increase 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.500
 difficulty due to the size of the account 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.780
 there are bigger accounts quotes and accounts 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.970
 very tiny to stimulate 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.590
 fine motor and can also help 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.590
 for impulsivity 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.190
 the next activity is known as 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.010
 Threading also has a sequence 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 but it's more related to space is 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.440
 say luciana has to respect that the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.810
 cord enters up and down up and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.510
 down then this sequence of space 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.740
 it will help that illusion serves the question 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.740
 of spatiality 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.110
 activity number 2 we will need 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.750
 clothes pegs and a box 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.390
 with edges ready to do it more 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.579
 complex we painted a sign to 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.730
 each tweezers a circle a happy face 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.549
 and a triangle the activity consists of 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.610
 go placing the tweezers on the edge of 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.370
 the box I marked a pattern to luciana 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.430
 sequencing in this type of pattern 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.459
 bring into play more visual attention and 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.129
 that the signs are tiny not so 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.560
 easy or quick to differentiate as 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.950
 it's colors if you use tweezers 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.129
 colors can have a color pattern 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.349
 here it is important that you observe that 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.090
 so much can your child and you 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.160
 put a limit if you are going to give 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.500
 number of tweezers or if they are going to have a 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.650
 small medium box and ask you to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.190
 fill it 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.710
 The most important thing about this is that the child 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.669
 enjoy the activity and make it a 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.669
 moment to share 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.760
 activity number 3 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.010
 we are going to need a little bottle and 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.220
 seed varieties in this case 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.380
 We use three types of chickpea beans and 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.510
 macaroni the activity may have 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.430
 different degrees of difficulty can you 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.500
 ask the child to simply enter 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.260
 little seeds in the little bottle that would be the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.900
 basic level of the activity or else you 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.180
 they can ask you to follow a pattern to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.860
 work at the same time sequences and 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
 organization and you can 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.020
 present the seeds separately and 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.850
 even accommodate the containers in the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.980
 order of the pattern one more level 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.070
 complex that is the one that I used with 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.320
 luciana is to stir the seeds that are 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.540
 they are using to establish the pattern and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.390
 place it flexible for the child with 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.340
 Mixed seeds demand more 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.350
 attention and visual discrimination to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.050
 Luciana or the child's discrimination 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.790
 visual is a process also involved 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.010
 in literacy because all the 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.040
 letters are made up of very lines 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.260
 similar and are details sometimes very 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.090
 minimum or small ones that make a difference 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.020
 one letter of another is important that the 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.240
 children have this 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.930
 of super visual discrimination 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680
 tuned 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.680
 again 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.810
 activity we only need paper 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.990
 from china this activity is super basic 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.349
 and it's about tearing and thrashing consists 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.599
 in tearing the paper break it into pieces 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.060
 between small and medium and 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.449
 later fly it to make balls 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.880
 we just tear and come back but 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.860
 you can also hit the balls myself 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.750
 I recommend a contour or a line 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.370
 for example a heart and that go 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.130
 delivering the balls in the line of 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.560
 heart I recommend you respect the 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.660
 directionality that is used in the 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.919
 letters and in writing from left to 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.919
 right and top to bottom 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.440
 activity number 5 for this 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.670
 activity we are going to need paintings of 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.680
 colors and leaves with some patterns 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.690
 we did this activity at the end 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.580
 so luciana and I was a bit tired 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.250
 and I put a very simple pattern but 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.130
 you can use type patterns 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.720
 zig zag labyrinth curves as best they 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.940
 basically look like the activity 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.190
 is that the child with his finger go 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.010
 following the pattern this activity is 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.440
 more relaxed more simple involves the 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.780
 eye-hand coordination equally of 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.730
 support for fine motor skills and all 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.890
 literacy processes and or 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.290
 I recommend that they use frets 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.300
 transparent or white because it can be 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.160
 complex for the child to distinguish the 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.040
 color of the paint and the color of the 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.780
 storeroom and I did not have others and use those 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.350
 but better use whites or 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.350
 transparent 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.379
