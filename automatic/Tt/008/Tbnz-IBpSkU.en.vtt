00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
am Titus Meade the second apparently of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219 
am Titus Meade the second apparently of
the<00:01:46.290> cyrodiil<00:01:46.829> Empire<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.960> don't<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.110> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the cyrodiil Empire I don't think it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
the cyrodiil Empire I don't think it's
actually<00:01:49.590> called<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> Serie<00:01:50.520> Dilek<00:01:50.880> Empire<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
actually called the Serie Dilek Empire I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
actually called the Serie Dilek Empire I
think<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> Imperial<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
think it's like the Imperial but as you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.179 
think it's like the Imperial but as you
can<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.850> each<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.560> new<00:01:55.560> races<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
can see each of the new races it's
they're<00:01:56.490> given<00:01:56.759> unique<00:01:56.969> buildings<00:01:57.450> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
unique units they're given a ability

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630 
unique units they're given a ability
which<00:02:00.899> kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.439> goes<00:02:01.680> along<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.100> what

what they're kind of like

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.030 
what they're kind of like
so<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.480> races<00:02:11.720> are<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.050> Skyrim<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
so all the races are like the Skyrim the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.150 
so all the races are like the Skyrim the
Daedra<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.900> does<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> scenario<00:02:15.770> I've

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
Daedra it does have the scenario I've

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.610 
Daedra it does have the scenario I've
never<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:16.730> played<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:18.020> scenario

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
never actually played this scenario

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.470 
never actually played this scenario
because<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> nice<00:02:19.820> thing<00:02:19.970> about<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.210> bonds

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because the nice thing about this bonds

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.060 
because the nice thing about this bonds
you<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.690> use<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.290> regular<00:02:21.650> game<00:02:21.860> which

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
you can use it in a regular game which

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.650 
you can use it in a regular game which
is<00:02:22.190> intertwined<00:02:22.640> with<00:02:22.880> all<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.240> other<00:02:23.390> races

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
is intertwined with all the other races

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.010 
is intertwined with all the other races
but<00:02:24.700> as<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.150> here<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:29.420> Imperial

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
but as you can see here the Imperial

but as you can see here the Imperial
City<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:31.370> map<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.640> supposed<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.300> be<00:02:32.420> set

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
City and this map is supposed to be set

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.970 
City and this map is supposed to be set
up<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.960> lot<00:02:33.320> or<00:02:34.390> exactly<00:02:35.390> like<00:02:35.720> Tamriel<00:02:36.530> itself

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
up a lot or exactly like Tamriel itself

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.730 
up a lot or exactly like Tamriel itself
was<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.540> can<00:02:38.660> see<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> kinda<00:02:39.290> looks<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.590> lot

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
was as you can see it kinda looks a lot

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.110 
was as you can see it kinda looks a lot
like<00:02:39.860> Tamra<00:02:40.250> I'm<00:02:40.340> not<00:02:40.490> gonna<00:02:40.670> play<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> full

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
like Tamra I'm not gonna play a full

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.080 
like Tamra I'm not gonna play a full
game<00:02:41.270> here<00:02:41.630> but<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.010> see<00:02:43.190> each<00:02:43.790> city

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
game here but as you can see each city

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.330 
game here but as you can see each city
has<00:02:44.300> their<00:02:44.450> own<00:02:44.510> color<00:02:44.930> there's<00:02:45.890> no<00:02:45.980> real

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
has their own color there's no real

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.800 
has their own color there's no real
changes<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.880> anything<00:02:47.240> major<00:02:47.510> like

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
changes to anything major like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
changes to anything major like
technology<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:49.090> anything<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.210> such<00:02:50.390> if<00:02:50.630> we<00:02:50.780> go

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
technology or anything as such if we go

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.560 
technology or anything as such if we go
over<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.230> as<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.700> same<00:02:52.730> stuff

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
over here as you see it's the same stuff

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.260 
over here as you see it's the same stuff
that<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:53.810> normally<00:02:54.080> deal<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.710> there's<00:02:54.980> no

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
that we normally deal with there's no

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.290 
that we normally deal with there's no
changes<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.300> technology<00:02:57.110> throughout<00:02:58.210> but<00:02:59.210> you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
changes in technology throughout but you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.650 
changes in technology throughout but you
know<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.540> adds<00:02:59.720> new<00:03:00.020> units<00:03:00.440> new<00:03:00.680> buildings<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
know it adds new units new buildings the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.510 
know it adds new units new buildings the
capabilities<00:03:03.530> each<00:03:03.860> race<00:03:04.850> has<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.340> think

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
capabilities each race has so I think

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.160 
capabilities each race has so I think
this<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.120> really<00:03:08.450> fun<00:03:08.810> mod<00:03:09.290> because<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:11.140> am<00:03:12.140> a

really<00:03:49.910> like<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.750> especially<00:03:51.500> since<00:03:51.860> I've

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
really like it especially since I've

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.979 
really like it especially since I've
grown<00:03:52.670> up<00:03:52.700> with<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.209> Elder<00:03:53.480> Scrolls<00:03:53.510> series

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
grown up with the Elder Scrolls series

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.009 
grown up with the Elder Scrolls series
in<00:03:54.200> my<00:03:55.130> life<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.030> think<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.660> is<00:03:56.810> something

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
in my life so I think that is something

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.520 
in my life so I think that is something
that<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:58.070> should<00:03:58.100> all<00:03:58.989> kind<00:03:59.989> of<00:04:00.140> look<00:04:00.320> into

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
that you should all kind of look into

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.930 
that you should all kind of look into
and<00:04:00.739> see<00:04:00.769> if<00:04:00.950> you'd<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:01.250> interested<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.850> I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
and see if you'd be interested in it I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.460 
and see if you'd be interested in it I
don't<00:04:02.269> give<00:04:02.510> ratings<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.080> that<00:04:03.350> is

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
don't give ratings but that is
