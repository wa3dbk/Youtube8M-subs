00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.330 
own wireless network it's really cool
and<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> works<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> have

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and the way that it works is you have

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.980 
and the way that it works is you have
all<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.850> devices<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:30.420> matter<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.840> many
