00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.840

 on the platform of the latest nvidia processor 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.969
 tegra k1 which is able to endure 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 desktop level mobile games 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.250
 past generation consoles and so 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.189
 let's see what we have 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.150
 bundling micro usb cable 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.150
 such an adapter 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.700
 instructions for use needle for 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.040
 opening the sd card slot inside us 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.870
 is the central quad 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.780
 2 and 2 gigahertz processor 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.570
 + 1 energy saving core with reduced 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 frequency and nvidia graphics processor 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.370
 GK 20a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.290
 RAM two gigabytes 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.960
 internal memory 16 gigabyte plus 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.360
 memory card support up to 128 gigabytes 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.130
 micro sd 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.320
 battery capacity 6 thousand 700 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.780
 milliamper clock for example ipad tablet 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.700
 mini with retina screen has a capacity 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.680
 6470 battery 1 mile amp hour 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 The tablet works on the basis of android 4 2 2 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.770
 with shells now let's 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.190
 consider how it looks externally 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.970
 in front we see and ps display size 7 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.970
 and 9 inches and a resolution of 2048 by 1536 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.950
 points and fully landing pixels 326 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.899
 ppi 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.759
 for example ipad mini with a price almost doubled 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.229
 more than xiaomi mi pad 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.950
 having exactly the same characteristics 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.950
 display 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.610
 above we see the company logo and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 5 megapixel front camera 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.960
 below we see the three buttons home button 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.980
 back button and multitasking button 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.810
 on the right we see the adjustment buttons 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.810
 volume and lock button 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.210
 on top is a headphone jack and 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.840
 headset on the left side is the port for 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.410
 sd card bottom micro usb connector 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.410
 cable 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.790
 Rear camera 2 is located 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.940
 additional microphone and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.070
 stereo speakers 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:32.959
 and so now let's do a couple 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.730
 test start look at the test antutu 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.660
 tattoo showed us 40 thousand eight hundred 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.520
 eighty six points 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.110
 among the presented devices mipad 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.769
 is in first place now 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.260
 let's see what the epic citadel will tell us 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.269
 epic citadel showed 52 and eight frames 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.510
 per second so the picture is enough 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.930
 beautiful and smooth and it's time 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.500
 see the camera camera is like 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 xiaomi redmi laptop pretty good here 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.400
 You can use different filters but 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.530
 basic photo setup 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 produced directly above the very 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:21.470
 photo let's see for example 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.470
 it can be flipped 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.409
 You can also draw on it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:40.800
 and that is not very surprising you can 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.540
 cut but also worthy of attention and what 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.040
 it really surprised me 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.710
 pretty good opportunity 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.180
 adjust saturation brightness 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.200
 contrast pictures 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.200
 ability to add vignettes 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.950
 you can add a filter to the photo itself 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.950
 and add a frame 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.660
 I was also surprised by the opportunity to manually 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.920
 adjust the exposure during 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.920
 directly shooting 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.670
 so we have nothing inferior to all 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.400
 known apparatus 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.260
 ipad mini tablet with a price of almost 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.970
 two times less 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:24.250
 You can buy by calling 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:24.250
