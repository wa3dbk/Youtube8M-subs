00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.420
 v 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.070
 yes, now it's time the e3 has finally opened and our colleagues 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.799
 on site 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.320
 Swarm even like the industrious bees 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.840
 and in the area of ​​information about games together 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.570
 Yao the DAX the nectar pope in the area was probably the one yesterday 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.400
 nintendo press conference and the highlight there was of course the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.039
 Presentation of the new Nintendo game console 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.199
 We always joked here in the editorial office 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.699
 which will probably also finally support the Xbox 3 60m PlayStation HD 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.350
 3 too 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.750
 and there will be Nintendo who probably need to call it so 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.740
 Niederau high but no her name is 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.960
 how young and tinkering idiom can be 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 We have not found that out in Los Angeles for years 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.900
 how profile is a lot of sweets as the press delivered by the ISU never trains 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.650
 is it important these guys 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.930
 correctly, namely, the new Nintendo console called Millions should be the whole thing 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.520
 that looks like a place 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.539
 meet here 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.460
 the universities 05 on this day Screen Friedrich pointed this playground 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.500
 having to drink to their game 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.020
 Because of this risk by this decision in the parish around the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.870
 Diseuse here defeated the Olympic standard or left content, for example 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.920
 from 4 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.280
 on the console that can make Internet that is the biggest 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.250
 Concert in the Berlin Hansa Studios Christian Ziege player 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.330
 Partnership announced and is prelude percent announced on goals 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.930
 as soon as we know that it's all there or is it the picture 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.909
 what is the fair so exactly in the minute instead 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.429
 We do not know that 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.409
 only one thing is clear the mimes ultimately supports HD and therefore 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.279
 Also many third party games for the Wii u are producing there so are supposedly 

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:47.090
 Versions of Dachser that two German reporters even Battlefield 3 in the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.969
 Nintendo itself instead prefers well-known brands such as 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.530
 for example Zeller 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.010
 Per cent thanks be to Sky Word on the spot 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.020
 Of course, everything was already about an offshoot for the mobile phone aspect 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 Percentage annually the trailer is so for two flat shots Sellafield 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.790
 Considerable is also the focus in which again Sion will be 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.079
 until the fly 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.109
 finally put on the left with small boats 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.309
 Boehmer on the road was the mistake 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.319
 The place was previously as pastime so it will remain the paddock 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.269
 but what Nintendo time again 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.920
 The idea is, of course, once again a fair full of continuation 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.060
 one of them is called Hessen SCU swarming smile 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.709
 in which it again ec- or keeps the yes has already because it first announces 2 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.389
 and played the lead role with Barbara Hoth and this time it ends 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.739
 to Constantinople 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.479
 "That's the icing on the cake Istanbul 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.849
 NGOs meanwhile have become much better but also experienced and 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.599
 that's why he can now for example build bombs the bank threw the system 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.339
 you can call yourself as explosive 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.810
 Make explosives 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.379
 or smoke bombs after what everyone takes the least 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.650
 So I have so also new weapons under which he carried a hook with him 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.699
 can walk along ropes that can be found practically everywhere 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:06.879
 Konstantin Opel 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.299
 hanging over the roofs 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.199
 and, of course, there is support from him again 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.040
 Brotherhood we already know expansion with us and him of course after 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.309
 Percent Istanbul 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.089
 So she must have followed concepts 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:24.319
 So Revelations will be like a coherent narration of Ezio's adventure 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.509
 and there singing excited about how this continues, especially if that is the 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:32.499
 Adventures of Ezio brings to an end and if you are but then clear the way 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.650
 Do for one I'll do new Assassin's Creed 3 with the new hero 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.969
 and with the new scenario 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.249
 An entirely different scenario offers Tuncay Games are bio shock in finds 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:49.249
 this plays in a time difficult to classify Denk Hank parallel world 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.340
 also inside, which pulls its tracks over America 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.980
 this city provincial year 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.080
 originally intended as a technical marvel and perfect that 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.420
 But social fabric over the course of the game when they are more and more in chaos he 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.710
 should be a bit like at 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.090
 Rapture from the first two in commodities 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.169
 so for the administrators Fall Live be there 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.859
 We play a detective, Smoker took the bed of a conspiracy behind 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.120
 wants to get to the bottom of the walls of Konami and at the same time the girl 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:16.799
 could protect so casts 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.249
 who has magical abilities 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:20.970
 from the wheel of the young Werther 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.080
 BASF Internet exactly to the Weyher Schoppmeier so vote whether Apple this 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.120
 Balling still a bit weird technology respectively 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.430
 Magic is questionable only 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.110
 whether the game sand unusual setting of the abdomen 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.590
 Hens and customers and buyers will find 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.590
 because the thing is certainly not for everyone 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.350
 a far more classic continuation of it 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.130
 the new hit only a part 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.360
 that's what Lucia means to us 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.500
 the first trailer shows what the hit more with a single physical so am 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.030
 best can similarly not be pushed on different and mostly 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.860
 has no sound 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.199
 turn off 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.830
 nothing is known about the gameplay itself yet leaves the video 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.880
 but also open 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.450
 that's not just a string of orders 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.440
 but that maybe it's a bit more about the story of 7 40 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.639
 even goes 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.560
 they are all in the video the federal and the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.349
 the hitman obviously wants to kill 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.910
 Content namely its name because one asks oneself as well recognize itself 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.020
 and why he kills them if anything at all, that's all 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.890
 Of course they are still open at the moment. "We are very excited about that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.689
 on the sequel 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.040
 to go gradually 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.680
 Of course, in this case we had a lot to do with sequels 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.490
 come to the end now 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.060
 a sequel but that has at least a light and that's about it 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.889
 more 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.889
 True Hold the Line apology it was serious 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.419
 from Ubisoft 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.319
 So the thing becomes a bit of a tribute to the movie Inglorious Basterds 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.980
 Here Ubisoft says goodbye 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.749
 from this the serious approach to tactic shooter and WWII 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.449
 there presents percent 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.490
 the whole thing pretty crazy 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.499
 the roles are four American soldiers 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:00.409
 with Nazi Germany boat 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.360
 there's it 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.480
 yes wild types one is a half-brother from farm to farm the other is 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:06.499
 from 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.499
 the old crowd star has heavy SNB 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.180
 the team probably offers a lot of variety in a playful way 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.150
 the 4 happen to be from here these are the people that are the others too 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.870
 since those are all none have done and of course last with the Blue 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.470
 According to the fire was in conversation that means they can to one 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.110
 tactical shooter and the other 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.749
 then today only 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:31.809
 and maybe even a little anecdote at the end 

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:36.529
 I'm nice with the coach before that says a texan do not mess with 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.880
 Texas that is or Texan slogan 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.650
 and then internally advised by Greed box-champion Channel 1000 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.830
 He also did that on his Jeep life when I was walking and there 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.840
 need to shoot 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.030
 the guy after he packed five long guns and twelve bistro in his jeep and 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.060
 but was to stand in Munster and drink him a beer strategy had the 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.000
 not and how safe stowed and then he said no I have all these 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Sticker he stands do not mess with Texas 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.240
 this car to all normal very upright the colleagues but the Poles 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.490
 included ll 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.890
 come to speak before the shotgun praised the survival and if 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.330
 they do that 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.669
 Let's hear something new tomorrow, and then there'll be something new from me until then 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.669
 I have 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:21.559
 I lead
