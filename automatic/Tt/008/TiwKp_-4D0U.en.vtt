00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.320
 very cross 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.800
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.600
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.820
 once I bring you the duplication widget 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.970
 which will work in version 182 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.650
 As you can see I'm in survival mode in 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.020
 the hunger bar and the menu in the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.599
 creation and we will see what 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.070
 it would be a trick to duplicate blocks 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.770
 that can be broken down ie 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.300
 blocks of wood blocks of diamond 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.830
 iron blocks gold blocks worth 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.180
 it only serves for these materials when 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.489
 less at the moment if we find another 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.190
 glitch then I will warn you and well we are going to 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.449
 see how it works with wood worth 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.830
 we just need a table 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.360
 creation and let's go to the table of 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.269
 creation with the wooden block in the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.489
 hand let's press l topics see very 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.010
 fast and as you see the block of wood 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.900
 falls to the ground and at the same time we can in the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.170
 Creation table option to do 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.760
 planks worth very simple is clicks 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.729
 with wood because it can serve us 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.180
 Well, as I say simply by giving r &amp; b 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.190
 at the same time in the creation table will give us 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.229
 that option to turn planks into 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.909
 wood but the wood is also there 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.860
 in front with what we can duplicate 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.890
 wood with a block of wood without 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.690
 try we can have infinite vale 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.580
 so good guys we go with what 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.510
 would be the version for diamond iron and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.740
 gold 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.050
 which is a little bit more complicated because 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.360
 you have to press more buttons is worth the only 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.729
 what we have to do is press the east 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.700
 and go at the same time with the wood 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.490
 but an instant later but very very 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.080
 fast we have to press the eve for 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.840
 that changes that little eyelash that you are 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.479
 seeing with what we can decompose 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 the diamond block in diamonds 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.150
 normal and we would have the clip done 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.820
 ok just remember you lt ive and a 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.490
 instant after but very very very fast 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350
 we have to give l of this trick 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.509
 just guys practicing 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.979
 practicing and practicing will be every time 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.429
 easier at the beginning will cost a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.440
 little bit as I say but with practice 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.119
 can serve to multiply the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.380
 diamond iron and gold in a very 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.780
 easy and it's ok I'll go back to 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.130
 repeat it simply lt and go very fast 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.290
 and then lb 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.270
 As I say, it does not have to be at the same time 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.350
 the three buttons has to be first 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.240
 lt and go very quickly we press elevate and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.010
 I would be ready I hope that this video will 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.630
 has served as useful if you are 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.130
 in survival and you want to say 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.530
 duplicate a little bit without going out 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.900
 creative and good I hope you stop 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.880
 freeze my worlds like if you liked 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 sub for more videos and nothing I hope that 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.840
 soon we will see in new videos a 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.840
 I welcome you and see you later
