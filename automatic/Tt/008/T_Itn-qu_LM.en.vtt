00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.780
 Hello everyone, here we bring you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.000
 jose is not coña we bring you the tutorial 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.000
 of the data breaks that is basically this 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 I am explain in Spanish in English 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.559
 so two websites 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.059
 in English 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.870
 baleària dolls and that the examples the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.530
 I leave it still hurting me for a long time 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.329
 then it's worth to make the cat breaks 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 as its name says cat breaks you have 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.519
 to know how to make the cat and to break 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 we leave you here to break and here the cat 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.329
 so you can learn not if still 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.540
 you do not know we do and then already this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540
 tutorial 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 i 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 well this is a jump so to speak 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.430
 advanced because it's already mixing one thing 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:43.880
 with the other and basically you can do 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:46.310
 in high walls in which if you want more 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.950
 far is a form or but also what 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.259
 you can do in a mass before the cat 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 and then he breaks in that way 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.190
 make cats breaks and good is basically 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.660
 you do here the cat you know towards the other 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.600
 tip of the table and when you get to the 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.119
 another point of pushing to break is a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.280
 way to pass obstacles that are more 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.030
 lengths of what you could go through 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.030
 cats for example 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.670
 make a break and thus pass the table 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.510
 Hong Kong 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.600
 and with india 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.980
 d 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.180
 now you will see an example that later 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.790
 We are also going to leave several of them 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.670
 slow motion so you can see how it 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.800
 they put their hands in the air and to be 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.260
 grouped from there the two bases the bonuses 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.260
 ahead to finish topped with 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.120
 and if it's true 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.730
 as we always recommend to start 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.700
 practice this or grass or sand because 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.920
 so if something happens I'm sure if you want 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.090
 start doing it on a wall because it 's 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.950
 easier than a table because 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.850
 example you can do some time on the wall and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.140
 keep the hands that pushed not what 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.770
 you can try here a way to 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.800
 start practicing it is cat climbs 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.570
 low with low to break 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.530
 so you are doing it to remove the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.530
 fear until in the end you can do 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.390
 comedy and directly make the game 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.390
 like a table because it's longer 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.230
 woods 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.220
 dyn 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.220
 in different 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.680
 well then that when you make a table 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:45.390
 as it is longer to be careful in the end 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.390
 you have to go practicing 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.300
 Another tip that tables serve is no 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.460
 pull both forward on the cat or 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.950
 in the com but to throw a little more 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.670
 upwards for example now he's going to 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.670
 do the jumping show 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:18.610
 well then very very well in that 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.700
 time to pass legs good 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.540
 this is all for the tutorial I hope 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.540
 that you liked by the wind 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.770
 you can do it 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.780
 and subscribe while you are and if 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.510
 you want another tutorial we are going to let you 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.510
 up the site tutorial 

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:49.020
 Y 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.020
 so be it 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.910
 the contrast wants 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:01.079
 in spanish 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:34.859
 the wing 

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.909
