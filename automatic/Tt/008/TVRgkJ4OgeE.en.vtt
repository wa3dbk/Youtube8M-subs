playing the actual slender so far so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.950 
playing the actual slender so far so
good<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.170> mean<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.420> losing<00:01:09.420> hunger<00:01:09.720> quite

quick<00:01:10.200> actually<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> torch<00:01:13.890> at

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
quick actually and there is a torch at

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
quick actually and there is a torch at
the<00:01:14.100> beginning<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.610> didn't<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> torch

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the beginning I didn't take the torch

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
the beginning I didn't take the torch
reason<00:01:15.810> being<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.470> torch<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
reason being is because that torch is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
reason being is because that torch is
only<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.210> useful<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
only really useful if you have the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.340 
only really useful if you have the
dynamic<00:01:19.799> lights<00:01:20.400> mod<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.939> wish<00:01:21.930> i've<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
dynamic lights mod I wish i've got to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
dynamic lights mod I wish i've got to
install<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.280> basically<00:01:23.580> makes<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
install because that basically makes it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
install because that basically makes it
act<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> real<00:01:25.439> talk<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.790> which
