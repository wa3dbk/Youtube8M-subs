00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.689
 the scum were these breaking 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.250
 italy the show that airs from Monday 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:17.100
 at least in which we talk about what 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:19.529
 happens in the world before redoing with 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.839
 news or two update slash fixes in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 about other news items 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.660
 yesterday for king and towels not just one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.839
 silly family and a serious show indeed 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.759
 you know what first regards Indian 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.650
 we had talked about this woman from Calabria 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.210
 yesterday because she is an Argentine showgirl 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 candidate in parliament for the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 foreign constituencies and yesterday I said 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.330
 with the pdl but this news though 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.940
 been bounced on all the newspapers of 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.710
 planet is not correct because the woman 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 does not appear with the pdl but with a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 list called Italian for the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 freedom so this is another some 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 of you seem to be confused in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.380
 about the news I gave yesterday 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.300
 compared to the Neanderthal man and the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 woman who could have given her life 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.760
 neanderthal man 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.290
 moreover many of you don't read the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.510
 annotations to the videos because they look at the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.950
 video on smartphone or tablet is on 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.720
 different places and annotations do not appear 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.769
 for some obscure reason 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.140
 the news was somehow 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.539
 in fact denied by the person concerned 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.249
 professor george church precisely 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.140
 Harvard geneticist who would have said 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.570
 possible assisted fertilization of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 a woman with modified DNA for 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 to be able to create a Neanderthal man 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.670
 in short, more or less the rasic plot 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 park only that instead of the dinosaurs there 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.810
 they are very much less human beings 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.520
 apparently interesting though due 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 of a translation error of at least one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 translation error the words are spoken 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 man would have been ill 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.139
 therefore not actually interpreted 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 search for a woman to impregnate with 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.350
 a small neanderthal child who 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.359
 then he would come out of his 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 communal belly discouraging everything 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.049
 because we know it would have happened 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.609
 that would have happened when seen but 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 the news is not false of the whole man 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.270
 however he believes in these theories he hopes 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.039
 that in the future this is feasible either 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020
 possible but moving on to new ones 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.119
 news there is a new trailer for the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.399
 others cross there is a new trailer for 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.469
 the elder scrolls online I don't know if it is 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.469
 you know but hate getting ready to 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.179
 launch a rpg on the market 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.709
 online that will host a lot of 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.149
 players that I very much 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.920
 I will probably play I know it also does 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.690
 beta subscriber hoping me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.220
 they take hoping they take you and the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 new trailer definitively sanctions 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.819
 my inability to distinguish between 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.650
 sicilian graphic 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.689
 the real actors will not tell you what the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.999
 my decision if I think it's all 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.819
 graphics or seats a measure of things 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:25.260
 or are they just real actors because they are not 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.670
 sure of my choice for all 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.739
 time I was there saying a then 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.569
 purchases are real actors no no not 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.099
 they are real actors or maybe they are 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.500
 probably the best video I have 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.760
 seen in 2013 placÃ¬ in description e 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.409
 I look forward to this game that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.530
 I think something will debut like in the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.780
 2015 become reality because I do not see 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.700
 time to play my argon jana 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.889
 she said before moving to the last one 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.299
 segment for today that I hope can be 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.310
 useful to some of you and I was 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.709
 requested by many of you I would like to search 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.299
 to make you smile at least when I 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.989
 I read this news I smiled 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.010
 we are talking about a 7-year-old luca ex child 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.709
 English that he wrote last Christmas 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.269
 to the Lego customer office because ve 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.689
 I explain it by reading his own directly 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.639
 letter 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.680
 hello my name luca psi and seven years 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.299
 with all my christmas savings me 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.599
 I bought the ninjago kit of 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.949
 ultrasonic predator number is 94 49 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.230
 it's really very beautiful 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.849
 Dad brought me out of walls and got me 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.680
 told to leave the characters at home but 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.229
 I took them with me and I lost jay 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.250
 z hicks to the store because I fell 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.689
 from the coat 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.609
 I'm really sorry I lost it 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.870
 test told me to send you an email 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.229
 to see if it is possible to have one 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.060
 other 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.459
 I promise not to ever take him back to the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.780
 if I ship, send me the letter 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.759
 already very sweet made me in itself 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.409
 smile only to read that but it is 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.299
 the answer that convinced me to 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.949
 talk about this thing because it shows 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.500
 how important is the customer 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.699
 for a company is the one I read in 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.139
 this case shows rather 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.909
 up to the situation 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.949
 because this is the answer that comes 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.139
 sent to the child luca I told the cell 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.090
 6 v that the dj priority was only one 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.650
 accident and that you never, ever would have 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.569
 made to repeat itself has me 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.219
 then instructed to tell you your business 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.290
 father really looks like a very person 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.060
 wise you must always protect yours 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.489
 ninjago characters like dragons 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.199
 protect the weapons of spins the master v 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.909
 He also told me it's okay to send you 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.949
 a new j and to add also a 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.479
 little extra because everyone saves 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.459
 all his money for christmas for 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.370
 buy ultrasonic predator must 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.560
 be really great 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 ninjago only remembers what he told you 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.639
 protect a character to a master 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.320
 like the weapons of push and it is always 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.430
 maybe he can stay with some books 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.410
 this news may seem like one 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.910
 nonsense takes a minute the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.560
 customer who was writing a letter 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.419
 of the genre but imagine the child 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.460
 how much happiness you can have in receiving 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.960
 over the toy this letter that 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.820
 somehow that's kind of 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.889
 mystery around is the fantastic thing 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.930
 I wanted to share it with you share 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.580
 even with you bishop is queen god there 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.139
 they are vittorio leggessi who send us 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.180
 this photo that you need to understand 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.010
 how far back i am in recovering 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.289
 your photos are venice where they live and 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.539
 they are dressed as Santa Claus and goblin 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.020
 you guys are so cute to say which way 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.639
 of jessica and you're the last thing 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.139
 I wanted to make money because there were so many 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.660
 they asked me for it and continue to 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.729
 send me link and question about it is like 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.199
 never in all the quick review I have 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.180
 made in the past few weeks 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.949
 parties that crown the policies I do not have 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.810
 talked about doing to stop the decline 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.580
 do to stop the decline is a 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.560
 movement that has recently become a 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.810
 political party the movement has it 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.100
 this man founded in oscar giannino 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.330
 is known mainly at a 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.580
 nationally renowned journalist 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.720
 what to do to stop the decline is one 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.940
 of those parties for which I 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.250
 naturally a propensity to 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.900
 sympathy is in fact a movement more with 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.940
 party because they are people who come 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.860
 from civil society they are not politicians 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.990
 which is born from below is born from below 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.820
 I mean it's funded by them 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.349
 activists just like the movement 5 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.300
 stars does not take election reimbursements 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.070
 that is the 5 star movement when I have 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.900
 could have given you this up for now 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.699
 party is so small that for now the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.010
 public financing if it can 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.500
 skoda is actually probably the only one 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.940
 truly liberal movement that is in 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.220
 italy right now in italy 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.120
 word freedom is almost everywhere in 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.410
 all parties 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.750
 the word freedom is very fashionable 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.340
 lately but a liberal party is not 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.720
 the pdl generally at the base of the 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.310
 liberalism there is the idea that the state 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.830
 central is not such a machine 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.539
 large so heavy so incisive in the 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.639
 life of citizens but only there 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.500
 decide the general rules and do 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.979
 by many a social figure where there is one 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.440
 need 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.360
 the program of this movement is on a 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.710
 site that I leave you in description there is 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.110
 also a forum on which it is possible 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.020
 discuss which is a very good thing 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.020
 welcome to the 2013 program 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.610
 it is entirely 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.889
 stable online but is also summarized on 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.509
 site at ten focal points number like 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.009
 make all parties now some of 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.990
 these points are also common to many 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.639
 parties but others appear 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.990
 to address some types of issues in 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.370
 very different way from the parties 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.050
 classics for example the idea that i 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.300
 state contributions to those who lose their jobs 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.039
 do not serve to integrate that 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.150
 worker in the same company but 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.800
 they serve more than anything else to give a 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.289
 support for the person is perhaps 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.789
 forming it to help her find a new one 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.110
 workplace thanks to the system 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.819
 this more flexible economic 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.520
 movement for another is to say that it is 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.139
 supported by great personalities such as ad 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.310
 example the economist Boldrini too 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.259
 he would see it on television because 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.970
 rather well known then this true with 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.500
 a bet to do for formalized not 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.270
 I also because the current state is a lot 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.800
 difficult that this flash movement 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.169
 party manages to overcome the barrier 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.849
 of votes which means that to get into 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.800
 parliament must have a minimum of 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.849
 percentage of votes otherwise is not 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.349
 possible to enter because if not 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:17.389
 otherwise anyone would do a 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.130
 party with 40 votes enters parliament 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.259
 and therefore it is necessary to avoid 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.210
 this I personally have doubts 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.889
 on the possibility in this movement of 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.629
 overcome the barrier however 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.219
 I hope it is indeed right 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.719
 that there is also a strong voice 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:32.030
 liberal within the parliament 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.169
 liberals historically never are the 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.150
 there are also majority in the states 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.770
 united and no one knows the candidates to the 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.509
 presidency were not two there was also 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.219
 johnson that the candidate will free the 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.330
 which nobody I spoke but I believe 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:43.639
 would have answered your question 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.130
 personally I ideologically me 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.569
 I feel a little free that probably me 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.460
 I feel a bit liberal because of Italy's 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:50.630
 liberal knows nothing but this 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.190
 scum and everything I had from 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.110
 slight for today thanks for watching 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.009
 below is the link to all the 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.479
 things I do 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:59.029
 in the description you will find the link to 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:00.229
 all the things I said and therefore not 

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.000
 it remains to thank the fan boys 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:05.449
 page that sponsor breaking italy 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.130
 every shell of the good guys 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.190
 put the like also for you see 

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.860
 half of me like it is a destination for them 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:17.380
 but me this part the most one 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.380
 more phallic see you tomorrow at 18
