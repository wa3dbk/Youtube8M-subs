 any smartphone or tablet is a game 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.160
 too simple for you to play when 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.969
 so until the end and then understand the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.440
 see these bees I can not 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.180
 touch the bees or I'll miss a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.760
 life I have two lives was marking on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.159
 field up or for ant here eye 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.290
 Formigli a life much more a life 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.530
 modern ant 15 preventing it should 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.049
 until the end but saw the larger ants 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 de pitot here I know twice to play 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.909
 tower defense defend yours is there 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 what would you be here at the end of the table 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.829
 of the timber and you would have to 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 defend against these ants that come 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.140
 fearing that these emerging 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.140
 now my guy is coming out has these 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 bit more score has a thing as well 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.119
 Nice the game has had an update and if 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.170
 says totally something new that does not 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.509
 you know here it is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.009
 he has an update I think yesterday 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.390
 now playing the game I did not play 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.280
 after the update 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.189
 if you have something new or you end up 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
 conferring with you now until it is 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.909
 animation of ants looks like 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.590
 took our animation that gives the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.500
 You want to catch an animation. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.759
 probably real even ant some 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.319
 motion pictures an ant 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.140
 but neither is it ours that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.110
 realist understands is realistic in the sense 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.849
 for example that the image quality 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 ant to draw more movement 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:28.220
 do you really see one thing well 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 shot 11 so have a gif was 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 The bee was close to the ant. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 complicated that I hit her, I'm not 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.410
 seeing no really simple game same game 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.420
 for you to kill a time in the queue of a 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.310
 The place that is waiting there is a 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.170
 playing this game as I said and 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.810
 light the fuck it will turn on any 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.819
 smartphone or tablet if this issue 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.250
 some of them are very few mega 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:58.010
 type putz and is too light to occupy 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.239
 no space in your eyes that does not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 will occupy no space that 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.260
 device with android is very light even 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.459
 ten points each year almost even 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.530
