00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.860
 hello how are we going to weave a flower that 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.260
 It is of openwork design very useful for several 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.180
 Projects 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.820
 this yarn that I'm going to use is 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.950
 flame breeze and I'm going to use a hook 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.950
 of a thickness of 4 millimeters 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.480
 as I just knit a flower as it is 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.110
 navas to give you an idea of ​​how much 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.489
 the fabric grows with these materials 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.120
 here I am going to weave two chains very 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.370
 reinforced 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 and from here I'm going to weave seven 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:48.379
 chains 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in the first 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.769
 chain that we have here I'm going to fit the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.769
 hook 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.190
 Slipped point sac and from here 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.870
 I'm going to weave 16 half points for the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.690
 height of this round of half points 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.119
 I'm going to weave 2 chains that count as 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.479
 if it were a half point and in the center 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.759
 of the circle I will start to knit my 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.759
 half points here would be the second 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.010
 4 I will go hiding this era according to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.780
 go knitting the media points well 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.780
 until you reach 16 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.510
 here I already have the 16 half points I'll 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.240
 close with a visa point in the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.730
 first two chains that I knitted either 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 taking the chain from above 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.770
 or between point and point and here I leave you a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.660
 visa point to close the round 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.200
 I'm going to start here with 10 chains 1 2 3 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.200
 4 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:59.380
 and I'm going to knit here with triple loop I 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 to make a triple high point I'm going to leave 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.850
 happen if the chains came from here 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.390
 then I will let a medium pass 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.540
 point and where it continues like this I will 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 fit to weave by drawing a point two 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.790
 centuries two centuries two centuries and two 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 centuries 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.110
 here I am taking it out in five times 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.590
 I'm going to continue here knitting five 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.590
 chains 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.159
 I take 3 loops 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.980
 and continued to let go a half point and 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:39.420
 where the subway follows the hook and pulled out 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:42.269
 here I pulled a thread 2 2 2 and 2 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.819
 this was brought out in five times that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.889
 equals the five chains we weave 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.079
 at the beginning to give height and the others 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.530
 five will be giving width to 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:57.090
 each of these petals one two three 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.730
 four five and we continue with three the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.670
 fairies for the triple high point that will be 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.010
 in this one but in the one that follows 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.250
 so let's continue weaving all the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.710
 back to achieve 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.570
 eight triple high points here already 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.240
 we are four we are going to continue until 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.020
 get here here two four are here 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.370
 six eight triple high points I weave the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.370
 last five chains 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.349
 and I'm going to close here the return with point 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:31.120
 slid by fitting the hook in the 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:34.030
 sixth string 1 2 3 4 5 in the number 6 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.470
 the slid set I'll start here 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:43.020
 my turn weaving two chains and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.470
 continue weaving here a crochet stitch 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.450
 so here I practically have two points 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.510
 vareta because the two chains that she wove 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.610
 the beginning count as a point vareta and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.780
 with the next one it would be two I'm going to 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.380
 knit now two high points hung in 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 these chains 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.950
 I'm going to knit now with double room two 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.950
 double high points 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.250
 well first I'm going to knit 1 next I'm going 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.190
 to weave here three chains 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.340
 and about this that is the double high point 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.090
 I'm going to weave here a visa point to 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.640
 generate a little bit here took double the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.230
 room and continued to hang here a point 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.230
 high double 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.020
 well after two high points 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:55.289
 after the two high points here I go 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.529
 to knit a crochet stitch 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.649
 two chains 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.589
 and I'm going to weave where the base of the 

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:07.069
 double high point here I'm going to weave a 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:10.009
 point slipped two strings and I'm going to 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:13.719
 start just as you start here with a 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.719
 point is worth hanging here 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.870
 then two high points 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.960
 one 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:28.099
 all after a double high point with 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.099
 double loop 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.800
 122 centuries and two centuries 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.230
 three chains to make the piquito 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.890
 fit in the chain of the point here 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.320
 from above to knit visa point and 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.430
 yew with two loops another another point 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.430
 high double 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:06:00.220
 let's weave now two high points and 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.220
 then a point vareta 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.610
 then two chains and we put the point 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.310
 of visa at the base here 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.590
 we start again two chains and so 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.229
 successively as we have weave 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.980
 these two petals so we are going to weave the 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.040
 everyone 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.860
 this way we will be staying here and I finished with 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.430
 the point vareta yejo the last two 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.480
 chains to finish fitting here a 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.480
 visa point 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.180
 Here I leave you a very reinforced chain 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.130
 and short shit 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.800
 Well, look here, it's finished 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.930
 hide the zebras and then nothing more than 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.360
 see the size that this flower gave us 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.090
 this breeze yarn and this 4 hook 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.580
 millimeters thick and this was the 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.410
 size that he gave me weaving the same step 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.919
 step by step but with a thread called 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:59.590
 glass that is thinner and a hook 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.729
 stainless steel number 4 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:06.270
 thank you for being here that is very well 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:06.270
 until next time
