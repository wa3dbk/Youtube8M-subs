other<00:00:32.579> form<00:00:32.700> which<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.630> believe<00:00:33.989> will<00:00:34.440> be

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
other form which I believe will be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
other form which I believe will be
strictly<00:00:35.550> digital<00:00:36.000> service<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> days<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
strictly digital service so the days of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.420 
strictly digital service so the days of
physical<00:00:38.940> rewards<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.899> pretty<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:40.890> gone<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
physical rewards are pretty much gone I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
physical rewards are pretty much gone I
know<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.329> releasing<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.809> couple<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.200> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
know they are releasing a couple more in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
know they are releasing a couple more in
February<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.160> hopefully<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.940> something

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
February so hopefully it's something

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
February so hopefully it's something
that<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.930> rest<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.260> points<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
that I can use the rest of my points on
and<00:00:47.149> hopefully<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.390> something<00:00:48.510> substantial

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
remember what exactly they were billed

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
remember what exactly they were billed
as<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:32.420> Nintendo<00:01:33.420> site<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:35.040> one

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
as I on the Nintendo site I think one

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
as I on the Nintendo site I think one
was<00:01:35.369> called<00:01:35.579> Pikmin<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.170> pretty

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
was called Pikmin but they're all pretty

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.940 
was called Pikmin but they're all pretty
different<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.960> call<00:01:40.140> them<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.500> specific

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
different so to call them one specific

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.160 
different so to call them one specific
thing<00:01:40.979> doesn't<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:41.759> make<00:01:41.970> sense

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
thing doesn't really make sense

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920 
thing doesn't really make sense
Princess<00:01:43.860> Peach<00:01:44.070> card<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.390> here's

all the bad guys from the game series is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.610 
all the bad guys from the game series is
a<00:02:10.760> really<00:02:11.760> nice<00:02:11.940> kind<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
a really nice kind of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.390 
a really nice kind of
silhouette<00:02:14.620> background<00:02:15.579> drawing<00:02:15.939> of<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
silhouette background drawing of a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.920 
silhouette background drawing of a
Bowser<00:02:19.290> very<00:02:20.290> cool<00:02:20.560> more<00:02:20.859> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.069> back

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
Bowser very cool more on the back

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.470 
Bowser very cool more on the back
hopefully<00:02:22.930> that'll<00:02:23.319> show<00:02:23.620> up<00:02:23.909> but<00:02:24.909> this<00:02:25.269> one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
hopefully that'll show up but this one

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
hopefully that'll show up but this one
so<00:02:25.659> far<00:02:25.689> so<00:02:26.049> good

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
so far so good

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.369 
so far so good
so<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:27.909> they<00:02:28.030> usually<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.719> is<00:02:28.749> I<00:02:29.079> think<00:02:29.139> they

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
so what they usually do is I think they

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.819 
so what they usually do is I think they
stick<00:02:29.829> a<00:02:30.099> couple<00:02:30.579> in<00:02:30.730> yeah<00:02:30.939> they<00:02:31.120> did<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> we'll

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
stick a couple in yeah they did so we'll

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.869 
stick a couple in yeah they did so we'll
take<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> look<00:02:33.189> at<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:33.670> one<00:02:33.879> here<00:02:35.879> then

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
take a look at the first one here then

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.059 
take a look at the first one here then
on<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.209> inside<00:02:37.599> pretty<00:02:38.439> simple<00:02:38.889> but<00:02:39.040> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
on the inside pretty simple but I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.309 
on the inside pretty simple but I
actually<00:02:39.310> really<00:02:39.669> like<00:02:39.909> this<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.389> like<00:02:41.079> nice

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
actually really like this I like nice

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610 
actually really like this I like nice
clean<00:02:41.889> looks<00:02:42.930> some<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.079> Mario<00:02:44.379> characters

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
clean looks some more Mario characters

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.030 
clean looks some more Mario characters
Yoshi<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:46.349> really<00:02:47.349> like<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.769> one<00:02:47.889> you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
Yoshi in there really like this one you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.860 
Yoshi in there really like this one you
can<00:02:48.159> flip<00:02:48.430> reverse<00:02:48.969> the<00:02:49.329> side<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.719> can<00:02:49.840> see

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
can flip reverse the side you can see

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.330 
can flip reverse the side you can see
it's<00:02:50.079> got<00:02:50.169> the<00:02:50.200> spine<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.680> inside<00:02:51.040> so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
it's got the spine on the inside so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.020 
it's got the spine on the inside so
it'll<00:02:52.030> hold<00:02:52.180> 18<00:02:52.599> games<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:54.069> one<00:02:54.340> feels<00:02:54.879> a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it'll hold 18 games this one feels a

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.319 
it'll hold 18 games this one feels a
little<00:02:55.540> bit<00:02:55.719> more<00:02:56.400> sturdy<00:02:57.400> than<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.939> original

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
little bit more sturdy than the original

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.379 
little bit more sturdy than the original
one<00:02:58.449> that<00:02:58.599> I<00:02:58.689> picked<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:59.219> on<00:03:00.219> the<00:03:01.000> original<00:03:01.329> you

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
one that I picked up on the original you

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.849 
one that I picked up on the original you
kind<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.659> push<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.109> a<00:03:02.199> lot<00:03:02.349> more<00:03:02.379> this<00:03:02.680> one

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
kind of push it in a lot more this one

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.289 
kind of push it in a lot more this one
feels<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.609> might<00:03:03.639> be<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.879> bit<00:03:04.090> better

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
feels like it might be a bit better

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.129 
feels like it might be a bit better
built<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.199> leave<00:03:08.199> that<00:03:08.469> there

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
built so leave that there

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.729 
built so leave that there
these<00:03:11.139> are<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.439> other<00:03:11.590> inserts<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
these are the other inserts we have a

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.369 
these are the other inserts we have a
Pikmin<00:03:15.370> insert<00:03:15.699> which<00:03:15.879> is<00:03:16.000> really<00:03:16.209> cool<00:03:16.480> and

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
Pikmin insert which is really cool and

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.499 
Pikmin insert which is really cool and
then<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.609> like<00:03:18.909> I<00:03:19.030> said<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.299> can<00:03:19.389> put

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
then you can like I said you can put

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:20.670 
then you can like I said you can put
these<00:03:19.629> on<00:03:19.750> either<00:03:19.900> side<00:03:20.169> you<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.379> have<00:03:20.409> pink

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
these on either side you can have pink

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.050 
these on either side you can have pink
on<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.799> outside<00:03:20.889> blue<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.609> inside<00:03:21.879> or

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
on the outside blue on the inside or

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.979 
on the outside blue on the inside or
vice<00:03:22.239> versa<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:24.549> that's<00:03:24.759> pretty<00:03:25.000> cool<00:03:25.359> and

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
vice versa so that's pretty cool and

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.789 
vice versa so that's pretty cool and
then<00:03:26.470> here's<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.799> more<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.189> lighter<00:03:28.709> version<00:03:29.709> of

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
then here's a more a lighter version of

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.179 
then here's a more a lighter version of
the<00:03:29.979> Mario<00:03:30.729> one<00:03:30.970> way<00:03:31.389> more<00:03:31.659> colorful<00:03:32.139> but<00:03:32.889> as<00:03:33.009> I

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
the Mario one way more colorful but as I

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.249 
the Mario one way more colorful but as I
said<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.729> like<00:03:34.000> simplistic<00:03:34.479> design<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:35.259 
said I really like simplistic design and

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.409 
said I really like simplistic design and
this<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.949> this<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.549> me<00:03:36.669> is<00:03:36.849> definitely<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.329> one

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
this is this to me is definitely the one

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.259 
this is this to me is definitely the one
I'll<00:03:37.540> be<00:03:37.629> keeping<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:39.519> that's<00:03:39.699> the<00:03:39.849> first<00:03:40.090> one

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
I'll be keeping so that's the first one

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.960 
I'll be keeping so that's the first one
each<00:03:43.269> one<00:03:43.509> comes<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:43.959> three<00:03:44.650> inserts<00:03:45.639> and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
each one comes with three inserts and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.879 
each one comes with three inserts and
because<00:03:46.810> they're<00:03:47.019> reversible<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.829> you

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
because they're reversible so you

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.490 
because they're reversible so you
basically<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.759> six<00:03:49.120> different<00:03:49.329> options<00:03:50.319> with

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
basically get six different options with

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.280 
basically get six different options with
each<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:51.150> which<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.359> pretty<00:03:52.780> cool<00:03:52.930> how<00:03:53.169> they

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
each one which is a pretty cool how they

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:03.229 
each one which is a pretty cool how they
do<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.560> actually<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.829> next<00:03:56.979> one<00:03:57.159> here

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.949 

I<00:04:03.269> also<00:04:04.260> ordered<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.799> shirt<00:04:05.609> which<00:04:06.599> I'll<00:04:06.750> show

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
I also ordered the shirt which I'll show

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.349 
I also ordered the shirt which I'll show
off<00:04:07.019> show<00:04:07.290> off<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.920> uh<00:04:08.040> as<00:04:08.849> soon<00:04:08.939> as<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.180> comes

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
off show off and uh as soon as it comes

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.369 
off show off and uh as soon as it comes
but<00:04:09.719> it<00:04:10.019> hasn't<00:04:10.290> shown<00:04:10.560> up<00:04:10.709> yet<00:04:11.719> again<00:04:12.719> very

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
but it hasn't shown up yet again very

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.159 
but it hasn't shown up yet again very
simplistic<00:04:13.829> design<00:04:14.719> really<00:04:15.719> a<00:04:15.750> big<00:04:15.959> fan<00:04:16.109> of

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
simplistic design really a big fan of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
simplistic design really a big fan of
this<00:04:16.410> I'm<00:04:16.650> guessing<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.519> I'll<00:04:17.729> probably<00:04:17.880> end

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
this I'm guessing that I'll probably end

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.870
