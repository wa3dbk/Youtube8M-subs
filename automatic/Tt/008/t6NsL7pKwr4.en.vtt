 the truth is reed and then this guys this is with us 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.050
 the chest that is here we will be able to fold 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.330
 various things and this chester will 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.920
 we walk but before we see 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.890
 things just listen to the sounds then 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.080
 have you can hear him breathing 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.010
 breathes when we stand next to him that is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 our two yes I hope you listen to it and 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.920
 when we open it then yes that is 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 very awesome sounds and guys this 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.190
 pretty cool thing i mean this one 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.840
 clean driving time for us to walk and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 will help us all the time and carry 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.210
 things for us and nadi much cool a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.280
 because it does not burn half in fire 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.160
 that is, you can safely carry I do not 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.450
 I know I can build my own, he is there 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.240
 nowhere will burn that is you can not 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.860
 worry the same way he doesn't sink and 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.300
 it's very awesome also he doesn't 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.890
 damage from falls if we 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 for example, we will climb a rock and he will suddenly 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.270
 will fall then it will not cause any damage 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.520
 and he is very useful not at all in theory 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.650
 mobs and we ourselves can do damage then 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.930
 there is if we hit him then of course we 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.110
 he suffered damage and unfortunately so far 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 now we need a moment there is no way 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.560
 cure him in the normal way we 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.660
 we can still take it if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 portion of healing in this way and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.170
 so cure him but the other 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.459
 Unfortunately, there is no way but all 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.530
 Equally it's pretty funny that is 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.630
 vodka on you chester down down key 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.130
 funny he's real cute and yes that's where 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.709
 set off in the market quickly give we 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.540
 just run and see yes that is 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.850
 he will be with us all the time 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.440
 pipe somewhere far away 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.170
 fly away and just see what will happen 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.550
 if we are far from flying then he just 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.940
 teleports to us like this 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.400
 way 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.950
 yes he will always be on it 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.630
 walk as well as this pure him 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.060
 such a function is that it can sometimes 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.370
 eat up your stuff but things don't exactly 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.170
 eat your food if you put a in 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.070
 inventory in his wine do not trade food 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.920
 for example an apple 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.080
 it can sometimes eat it ie 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.090
 the market is rarely what you can now because it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.280
 do not become try even if we put 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.660
 there cake cake pea or 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.690
 he eats him sometimes but now it's not 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.340
 happens 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.050
 yes that is you can see let's 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.140
 take pay from he too somehow 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.030
 loudly chomps Come on there is still no villages 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.480
 and it's pretty funny so are we 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.800
 we can all improve it 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.230
 This will remove these in one screw and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.330
 and the best of it how to improve it and us 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.980
 diamonds will be needed that is, we take it and 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.050
 mons opportunity 4 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.430
 and how is it u better we take all these 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.980
 diamonds and just put them like this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.020
 way and the upgrade button appears 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.570
 when we click what happens he 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.000
 it becomes so dark dark brown 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.270
 color and how is it better? 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.220
 it is now the week of vaults and as many as 12 and 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.500
 this is real africa well i mean we are here 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.540
 you can put all sorts of things on 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.120
 he will not eat anything at all until he 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.390
 wanting to eat let's run away just 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.700
 so that he is like us and goes here and 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.910
 here he is trying to come down though he 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.500
 spinning but still i don't care yet 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.310
 doesn't want to eat but he has one 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.800
 interesting feature 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.750
 by the way, that's about updating 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.700
 here these diamonds upgrade nowhere 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.370
 written on the site I found it myself 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.290
 that is because there it was written on 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.660
 mikraft form that it can 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.640
 upgrade but how to do it 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.650
 secret well yes he guessed it principle 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.710

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.350
 put him a diamond oh well yes 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.760

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.320
