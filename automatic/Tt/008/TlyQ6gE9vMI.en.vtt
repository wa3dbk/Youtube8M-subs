00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 the staff welcome and today i will teach 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.259
 how to make a motorcycle or a tricycle 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.570
 using the drive's engine 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.550
 ok computer only if you are in a 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.920
 old computer go from there mounted drive 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 and you will find the little engine that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.410
 I'm going to use this project and also already 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 I used in the other project that the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.510
 electric generator and as you can see 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 a state as the instructor is required 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.650
 you can connect directly in the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.650
 battery that will remain the same 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.210
 so come on people first have to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.530
 roll a sheet with if it was an hour and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 it was that of the fairs 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 but if you must already be much 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.379
 used to doing this, almost everyone 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.030
 projects begin in this way and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.230
 then they 'll have to use a leaf back 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.230
 how to make a tube 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.290
 lazzarotto now has a big piece 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.740
 past one side or the other will stay all 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.740
 team 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.360
 how can you see that a citizen of 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.930
 three frogs and a tub and now I go 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.710
 to start shaping here is part of our 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 of bodywork partnership of cars 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.470
 then basically the structure of the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.600
 mota the 3 5 2 since it initially made a 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.520
 isosceles triangle you already have two 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.280
 equal sides 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 I'll take one step more or less 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 so the HUOC 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.350
 See if I can mark a place in my 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.060
 tape handle is it go to in which between 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.650
 the market shares are the steps that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.509
 no tape does not fall so it has to 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.580
 leave that part for later 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.580
 to fit a switch if you have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.520
 the white part and inside a 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.930
 and I'm going to fit an axle to 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.120
 move the front wheel and play 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:16.019
 not to get those edges so 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.019
 off to make the athletic was 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.370
 side were wanting each other 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.690
 have to walk with tape to not be there 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.130
 was to fall and make the wheel to do 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.239
 flying does not know how to cut the small pieces 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.340
 equals 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.340
 then change it 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.550
 how is it that you have a necklace in the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.550
 top side on opposite sides two 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.760
 ready more or less is done 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.030
 main structure only needs to sign the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.530
 the wheel electronics are then lo 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.880
 I see that I will use that bullying is 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.590
 a little ball of the south 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.730
 if you want you can use youtube 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 in any shock 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.600
 It has to roll in this part here and then. 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.240
 go to the bored fit other there 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.640
 axis of the rear wheels I will use 4 in 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.590
 pines but you can only use two 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.270
 I'm going to use four because it's going to be more 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.980
 resistant so far you use a 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.280
 home there has to add a bit of 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.590
 glue is for wheels to be fixed only there I go 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.260
 fit that 9 volt battery or were 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 asking for glue that the instructor I will have 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.510
 of an old toy was damaged 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.180
 you can not stay in this part only gave 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:01.450
 so the law was thought to fit 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.040
 there a water switch is and water because 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.030
 I'll use it here including the iron 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.739
 weld 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.360
 now if you are children you have to 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.610
 very help the touch can not do 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.470
 this alone and is not even 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.440
 I need to use iron on you. 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.260
 they can simply connect the cables 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.290
 using tape to learn there some 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.720
 environment for them to part of the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.320
 positions and rest against the parties who 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.320
 required 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.870
 and it is ready 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.780
 the drive of the assembled computer only you 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.180
 on the drive will give as soon as I 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.640
 I did not record when I took the museum to do 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.640
 the project and we will find a way will talk 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.000
 assembling here and one connecting cables 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.430
 positive and negative of the engine 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.480
 singer'll paste in a cap 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:01.170
 It should be well centered cae which is 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:03.980
 a hard case to make it is and hit the 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.350
 haiti now how are you going to do 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.200
 you expose the haze hail would have to see 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.870
 to which side does the wheel spin on ok and 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.250
 depending is exposed on the other uno 21 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.170
 rock axis side 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.330
 You can see it is doing very well. 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.090
 here to advocate why then is a 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.560
 chapter enjoyment ok you made a 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.610
 flat surface goes very 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.780
 velocity 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.610
 if you want it to go with more 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.260
 speed and were only a rubber band on the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.600
 routine front and increase grip 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.860
 So I just hope you liked it. 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.450
 want to help the channel if you are a wiki 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:39.860
 and signed up to accompany those 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.860
 The things I do is stomatitis and tomorrow.
