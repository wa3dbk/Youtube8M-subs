 androidworld.it spender sony immediately after 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.540
 the presentation of the entire family of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 z3 products this is reflect three tablets 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.290
 compact or the 8-inch tablet 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 with 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.550
 z3 family then a tablet more 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 compact compared to previous ones 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 in the z tablet family if we so wish 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.510
 call it top of the range let's say so 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.060
 we mean performance thanks to a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 excellent camera hardware from 8.1 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.490
 megapixel with exmor rs technology 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 present the same as doing the 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.360
 mode obviously on which hour car 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 2 megapixel front camera and two 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.150
 once again the LED is missing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 flash the processor is a snapdragon 801 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.670
 quadcore from 2.5 ghz 3 gb of memory ram 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.690
 from 16 gigabytes expandable via micro 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.700
 sd the connectivity is not present 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.840
 in fact, don't excuse me, I'll be right back 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.060
 what I said is present 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 3g connectivity as is also present 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 possibility to call in fact has 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 present both the auricular capsule and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.229
 the microphone 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.170
 android is already updated to the last one 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.049
 kat kit release 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 here we go into settings and see it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.290
 here it is 4.4.4 among other things 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 here I'm 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.980
 a system update does not have 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.730
 not even released and already heavily the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.130
 system 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.480
 the interface is almost completely identical 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.630
 to that seen on the last xperia 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.980
 just change the middle button the icons 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.830
 here the drawer is quite large 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.990
 which runs from the left the il appears 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.820
 usual menu for management 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.720
 let's try a test that I don't have 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.580
 done 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.580
 we have to go on the internet let's see 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.840
 ok 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.729
 we are in germany therefore reasonably 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 upload first androidworld of the Dutch 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.130
 our ok okay it's just a test 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.890
 however our site does not have a version 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.890
 desktop although perhaps in no mode 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.890
 not even in in charge landscape 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.030
 you have seen that the keys are silent 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.980
 inside the screen then not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.070
 space is stolen from the outer frame 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.380
 it is resistant to water and dust 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.820
 exactly like the two smartphones then 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.920
 a very interesting product that 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.440
 combines a design that is a mixture of 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 the one seen on the previous xperia z 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.580
 tablet and the new family z3 not 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.220
 completely embraces the new design 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.660
 3 but precisely it is a middle way 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 aesthetically it resembles the previous ones 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.640
 models but the angles you see are 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.200
 decidedly more rounded than those of the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.300
 previous generation with a tablet 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.580
 very very interesting that we don't see 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.650
 time to try and then more 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.650
 in-depth in our editorial staff
