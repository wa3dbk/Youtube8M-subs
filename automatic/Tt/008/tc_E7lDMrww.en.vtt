 [EasySepTM - Separation of cells from leukocyte depletion samples without density gradient centrifugation 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 [Jason Dixon Master, Research Technician] 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Do you want to separate cells from leukocyte depletion samples? 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Density gradient centrifugation from leukocyte depletion samples in a busy laboratory prior to cell sorting 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 The process of extracting PBMC is very time consuming and requires high precision. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 STSELLELL Technologies' EasySepTM Negative Selection Kit 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Can help you extract unlabeled cells directly from leukocyte depletion samples 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 No need to use density gradient centrifugation 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 In this video we will show you how to prepare a leukocyte removal sample. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Cell sorting for EasySepTM and "Easy 50" EasySepTM magnetic poles 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 First, determine the volume of leukocyte depletion sample suspension 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Place the leukocyte removal sample bag on the extraction plate 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Open the pocket of the leukocyte removal sample bag 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Insert the port of the infusion tube 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Close the extraction plate and pressurize the sample bag 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Through the infusion tube 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Transfer the sample to a sterile vial 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Add an equal volume of ammonium chloride solution to the sample 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Gently flip up and down and mix for 15 minutes on ice 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Ammonium chloride solution contains cushioning 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Can gently lyse all red blood cells in the leukocyte removal sample 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 White blood cells are not affected 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 If the initial amount of leukocyte depletion is greater than 150 ml 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Centrifugally concentrate cells 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 This operation can reduce the amount of ammonium chloride solution 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 500 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Remove supernatant 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Then, add the appropriate lotion to the tube to wash the cells. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Such as PBS+2% FBS 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Turn off the brake and centrifuge at 150 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 After centrifugation, gently remove the supernatant 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Repeat the wash one or more times until most of the platelets are removed 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 The color of the cell mass may differ from the displayed 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 This difference does not affect downstream cell sorting 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 If using EasySepTM for cell sorting 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Residual red blood cells are removed by components in the EasySepTM antibody mixture 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Finally, resuspend the cells with the appropriate lotion 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Maintain cells at the right concentration 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
