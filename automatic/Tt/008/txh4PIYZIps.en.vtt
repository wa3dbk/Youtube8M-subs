you have two modes that you get from
this<00:01:59.170> switch<00:01:59.350> right<00:01:59.380> over<00:01:59.740> here<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.100> you

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
this switch right over here so you

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.859 
this switch right over here so you
having<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:00.999> off<00:02:01.149> that's<00:02:01.509> in<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.749> off

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
having in the off that's in the off

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.020 
having in the off that's in the off
position<00:02:01.899> right<00:02:02.499> now<00:02:02.649> there's<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.820> general

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
position right now there's the general

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.620 
position right now there's the general
version<00:02:04.539> that's<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.890> yeah<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.179> there's<00:02:07.539> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
version that's that yeah so there's a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.620 
version that's that yeah so there's a
demo<00:02:07.899> version<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.410> there<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
demo version right there and then and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.450 
demo version right there and then and

this is actually really cool looking

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.350 
this is actually really cool looking
though<00:02:41.260> okay<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.580> stops<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
though okay so and then it just stops so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.540 
though okay so and then it just stops so
you<00:02:43.780> can't<00:02:44.020> really<00:02:44.200> go<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.040> other<00:02:45.190> levels

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550

the<00:02:47.620> hell<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.250> thing<00:02:48.550> until<00:02:48.959> you

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the hell out of this thing until you

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.170 
the hell out of this thing until you
beat<00:02:50.200> shredder<00:02:50.620> if<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.890> slow<00:02:51.220> down<00:02:51.459> it'll

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
beat shredder if you slow down it'll

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.750 
beat shredder if you slow down it'll
glow<00:02:52.390> red<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.110> lose<00:02:53.380> if<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> shake<00:02:54.730> it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
glow red and you lose if you shake it

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.610 
glow red and you lose if you shake it
around<00:02:54.940> really<00:02:55.209> fast<00:02:55.300> it'll<00:02:55.930> light<00:02:56.230> up<00:02:56.260> blue

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
around really fast it'll light up blue

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.350 
around really fast it'll light up blue
and<00:02:56.769> green<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.340> keep<00:02:57.519> doing<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and green you keep doing that and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.570 
and green you keep doing that and
eventually<00:02:59.050> you're<00:02:59.170> gonna<00:02:59.319> win<00:02:59.650> each<00:03:00.280> time

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
eventually you're gonna win each time

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.670 
eventually you're gonna win each time
you<00:03:00.700> win<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.030> gets<00:03:01.180> harder<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:02.620> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
you win it gets harder to do it so you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.490 
you win it gets harder to do it so you
have<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.069> like<00:03:03.250> swing<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.610> around<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.970> lot<00:03:04.209> so

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
have to like swing it around a lot so

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.570 
have to like swing it around a lot so
hopefully<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.799> enough<00:03:05.830> space<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.459> here

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
hopefully I have enough space in here

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.009 
hopefully I have enough space in here
I'm<00:03:06.700> not<00:03:06.730> gonna<00:03:06.970> knock<00:03:07.209> any<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.540> stuff<00:03:07.840> down

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
I'm not gonna knock any this stuff down

a workout with this thing which is not

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.499 
a workout with this thing which is not

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
bad but it's kind of hard to keep track

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.869 
bad but it's kind of hard to keep track
exactly<00:05:51.289> like<00:05:51.469> how<00:05:51.680> well<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:51.979> was<00:05:52.129> doing<00:05:52.279> wool<00:05:52.669> I

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:52.879 
exactly like how well I was doing wool I

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.879 
exactly like how well I was doing wool I
was<00:05:53.270> talking<00:05:53.779> through<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.080> so<00:05:54.319> as<00:05:54.710> long<00:05:54.830> as

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
was talking through it so as long as

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.200 
was talking through it so as long as
you're<00:05:55.099> listening<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.699> it<00:05:55.789> you<00:05:55.849> can<00:05:56.029> see<00:05:56.060> how

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
you're listening to it you can see how

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.529 
you're listening to it you can see how
while<00:05:56.479> you're<00:05:56.599> doing<00:05:57.759> certain<00:05:58.759> movements<00:05:59.389> I

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
while you're doing certain movements I

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.040 
while you're doing certain movements I
think<00:06:00.139> certain<00:06:00.409> movements<00:06:00.860> kind<00:06:01.099> of<00:06:01.190> like

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
think certain movements kind of like

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.629 
think certain movements kind of like
neutralized<00:06:03.050> like<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.650> swinging<00:06:04.009> effect<00:06:04.490> I

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
neutralized like the swinging effect I

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.969 
neutralized like the swinging effect I
think<00:06:04.879> if<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:05.089> do<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.300> too<00:06:05.509> fast<00:06:05.770> or<00:06:06.770> if<00:06:06.800> you

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
think if you do it too fast or if you

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.040 
think if you do it too fast or if you
don't<00:06:07.129> give<00:06:07.490> big<00:06:07.759> enough<00:06:07.940> strokes<00:06:08.300> I'm<00:06:08.779> not

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
don't give big enough strokes I'm not

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.430 
don't give big enough strokes I'm not
exactly<00:06:09.289> sure<00:06:09.500> but<00:06:09.919> I<00:06:10.159> think<00:06:10.610> it's<00:06:10.699> pretty<00:06:10.849> fun
