across the UK does have some sugar in it
you<00:00:23.010> say<00:00:23.269> why<00:00:24.269> don't<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.660> say<00:00:24.779> specifically

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you say why don't you say specifically

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.820 
you say why don't you say specifically
how<00:00:26.250> much<00:00:26.519> sugar<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.590> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
how much sugar there is in this can for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.339 
how much sugar there is in this can for
example<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> find<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.140> don't

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
example I think if you find if you don't

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
example I think if you find if you don't
get<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.679> you're<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> side<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.669> thirty

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
get if you're on the side you say thirty

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639 
get if you're on the side you say thirty
do<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> percentage<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.440> don't

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
do you have a percentage on there don't

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.459 
do you have a percentage on there don't
you<00:00:34.800> yes<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> front<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:37.140> quite

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you yes right here on the front it quite

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
you yes right here on the front it quite
clearly<00:00:37.770> calls<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.730> amount<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.120> sugar<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
clearly calls out the amount of sugar in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
clearly calls out the amount of sugar in
this<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.590> coke<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.070> 185<00:00:41.579> thirty<00:00:42.329> five

this can of coke at 185 thirty five
grams<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> six<00:00:44.219> teaspoons<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
grams which is which is six teaspoons of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
grams which is which is six teaspoons of
sugar<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.770> about<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> same

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
sugar which is you know about the same

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
sugar which is you know about the same
amount<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> calories<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.780> cappuccino<00:00:49.350> or

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
amount of calories as a cappuccino or

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
amount of calories as a cappuccino or
half<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.250> glass<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.719> calories

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
half a glass on so there is calories

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
half a glass on so there is calories
actually<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.340> doing<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> say

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
actually so what we're doing is to say

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
actually so what we're doing is to say
look<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.899> information<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
look the information is here we want to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
look the information is here we want to
actually<00:00:56.399> provide<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.000> make<00:00:57.120> sure<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
actually provide and make sure you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420 
actually provide and make sure you
imagine<00:00:57.899> people<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
imagine people know if they go to the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
imagine people know if they go to the
cinema<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> small<00:01:00.989> one

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
cinema I think this is a small one

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
cinema I think this is a small one
hundred<00:01:01.530> big<00:01:01.710> ones<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.219> -<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
hundred big ones here - you go to the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
hundred big ones here - you go to the
cinema<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> count<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.470> jug<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> coke

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
cinema and you get a count a jug of coke

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.670 
cinema and you get a count a jug of coke
like<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.110> people<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.409> any

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like this do you think people have any

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.060 
like this do you think people have any
idea<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.310> much<00:01:08.430> sugars<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> maybe

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
idea how much sugars in it and maybe

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
idea how much sugars in it and maybe
they<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
they don't and and and I think one of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.020 
they don't and and and I think one of
the<00:01:13.049> things<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> need<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:15.439> 23

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
the things you need to do this 23

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
the things you need to do this 23
sachets<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.270> sugar<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.110> single

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
sachets of sugar in that single

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.690 
sachets of sugar in that single
container<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.450> equivalent<00:01:21.930> thereof<00:01:22.700> now

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
container the equivalent thereof now

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
container the equivalent thereof now
that<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> staggering<00:01:24.630> amount<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.259> sugar

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that is a staggering amount of sugar

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.070 
that is a staggering amount of sugar
isn't<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.909> why<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.390> focused

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
isn't it that is why we're very focused

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
isn't it that is why we're very focused
as<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:28.950> doing<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
look at this one here there's 44 packets

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
look at this one here there's 44 packets
of<00:01:44.880> sugar<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.049> one

isn't<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.470> look<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.680> think<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.610> need<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
isn't it look I think we do need to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.370 
isn't it look I think we do need to
recognize<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.570> things<00:02:24.750> need<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.080> change

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
recognize that things need to change

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.170

that<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> bigger<00:02:26.010> bobs<00:02:26.250> need<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.550> come<00:02:26.700> down<00:02:26.880> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that the bigger bobs need to come down I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540 
that the bigger bobs need to come down I
don't<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.680> talking<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
don't think that we are talking that the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.130 
don't think that we are talking that the
world<00:02:29.790> can't<00:02:30.090> change<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> world<00:02:30.900> doesn't

in the obesity epidemic do you I think

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820 
in the obesity epidemic do you I think
as<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> contributor<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> calories<00:03:10.320> into<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
as a contributor of calories into the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830 
as a contributor of calories into the
British<00:03:11.040> diet<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.700> course<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.120> must<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.540> mean

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
British diet of course we must I mean

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.690 
British diet of course we must I mean
soft<00:03:13.260> drinks<00:03:13.650> all<00:03:13.830> soft<00:03:14.160> drinks<00:03:14.400> together

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
soft drinks all soft drinks together

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.080 
soft drinks all soft drinks together
contribute<00:03:15.060> 2%<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.080> calories<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.850> part

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
contribute 2% the calories it's a part

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.640 
contribute 2% the calories it's a part
of<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.750> therefore<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.110> need<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.350> accept

of it and therefore we need to accept

of it and therefore we need to accept
our<00:03:19.830> role<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.940> that's<00:03:21.060> why<00:03:21.239> we

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
our role and we do and that's why we

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.170 
our role and we do and that's why we
want<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.750> focus<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.709> actions<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:24.150> believe

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
started then trying to get us all to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.420 
started then trying to get us all to
smoke<00:03:35.850> light<00:03:36.570> cigarettes<00:03:37.440> as<00:03:37.920> opposed<00:03:38.280> to
