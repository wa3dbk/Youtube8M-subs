curious<00:00:44.190> headset<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
curious headset I do not think that the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.340 
curious headset I do not think that the
two<00:00:47.309> sisters<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:48.059> immortal<00:00:48.629> actually

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
two sisters are immortal actually

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
two sisters are immortal actually
because<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.100> about<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> Celestia

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
because if you think about it Celestia

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
because if you think about it Celestia
has<00:00:51.420> been<00:00:51.600> training<00:00:52.140> Twilight<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.829> whole

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
has been training Twilight this whole

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.810 
has been training Twilight this whole
time<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.850> replace<00:00:54.329> her<00:00:54.920> therefore<00:00:55.920> Celestia's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
time to replace her therefore Celestia's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
time to replace her therefore Celestia's
and<00:00:57.649> will<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.800> coming<00:00:59.070> soon<00:01:00.530> ideally<00:01:01.530> mean

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and will be coming soon ideally mean

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
and will be coming soon ideally mean
obviously<00:01:02.430> wouldn't<00:01:03.000> end<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> show<00:01:03.750> but

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
obviously wouldn't end in the show but

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.859 
obviously wouldn't end in the show but
hypothetically<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:09.270> gets<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
hypothetically and this gets into this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.690 
hypothetically and this gets into this
whole<00:01:10.140> head<00:01:10.409> canon<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.010> actually<00:01:11.220> have

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
whole head canon that i actually have

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
whole head canon that i actually have
going<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.250> basically<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.290> what<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
going on and basically what I what I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.130 
going on and basically what I what I
think<00:01:16.650> makes<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.700> sisters<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.479> special

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
think makes the two sisters so special

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
think makes the two sisters so special
in<00:01:19.290> their<00:01:19.409> regards<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.280> were

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
in their regards is that they were

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.570 
in their regards is that they were
actually<00:01:20.939> born<00:01:21.330> alicorns<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.979> weren't<00:01:23.340> made

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
actually born alicorns they weren't made

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.039 
actually born alicorns they weren't made
like<00:01:23.939> Twilight<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.390> Princess<00:01:27.390> Candace<00:01:27.840> were

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
like Twilight and Princess Candace were

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.760 
like Twilight and Princess Candace were
and<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> explain<00:01:30.360> how<00:01:30.780> exactly

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and I'm going to explain how exactly

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160 
and I'm going to explain how exactly
they<00:01:31.950> were<00:01:32.040> born<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.479> Alcorn's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they were born the way I see it Alcorn's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
they were born the way I see it Alcorn's
are<00:01:34.350> sort<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> chosen<00:01:35.340> ones<00:01:35.549> there

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
are sort of like the chosen ones there

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179 
are sort of like the chosen ones there
are<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> people<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.960> ponies<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.829> should<00:01:37.979> say

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
are the people or ponies I should say

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.690 
are the people or ponies I should say
that<00:01:39.150> were<00:01:39.630> born<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> specific<00:01:40.770> reason<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that were born for a specific reason for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
that were born for a specific reason for
example<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> reign<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.700> discord<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.850> think

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
example in the reign of discord I think

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.170 
example in the reign of discord I think
they're<00:01:45.240> actually<00:01:45.390> born<00:01:45.899> during<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.680> ring

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
they're actually born during that ring

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.080 
they're actually born during that ring
so<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.450> were<00:01:48.509> born<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.680> defeat<00:01:50.159> discord<00:01:51.770> now

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
so they were born to defeat discord now

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
so they were born to defeat discord now
you<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.630> okay<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:56.250> they

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you would think that okay so if they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
you would think that okay so if they
were<00:01:57.119> born<00:01:57.479> sister<00:01:57.930> defeat<00:01:58.259> discord<00:01:58.439> why

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
were born sister defeat discord why

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.429 
were born sister defeat discord why
didn't<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.490> disappear<00:02:00.060> after<00:02:00.420> discord<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
didn't they disappear after discord you

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.740 
didn't they disappear after discord you
know<00:02:01.560> left<00:02:02.060> well<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.719> because

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
know left well I think that was because

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
know left well I think that was because
as<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.649> discord<00:02:05.250> had<00:02:05.430> broken<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.939> again

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
as we know discord had broken out again

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
as we know discord had broken out again
later<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.229> Twilight<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.280> her<00:02:08.429> friends<00:02:08.819> had

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
later where Twilight and her friends had

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.140 
later where Twilight and her friends had
resealed<00:02:09.330> him<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.470> their<00:02:10.830> purpose<00:02:11.280> wasn't<00:02:11.580> yet

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
resealed him so their purpose wasn't yet

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.790 
resealed him so their purpose wasn't yet
complete

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
complete

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.460 
complete
so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.150> would<00:02:15.300> die<00:02:15.660> until

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so I don't think they would die until

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.410 
so I don't think they would die until
their<00:02:16.650> purpose<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.100> complete<00:02:17.490> which<00:02:18.210> would

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
their purpose is complete which would

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.560 
their purpose is complete which would
explain<00:02:18.450> why<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.350> are<00:02:19.680> living<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.760> long<00:02:21.180> or

raise the Sun and Moon on her own so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.870 
raise the Sun and Moon on her own so
they<00:02:55.950> wouldn't<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.550> needed<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.730> when

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
they wouldn't be needed so I think when

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.490 
they wouldn't be needed so I think when
Twilight<00:03:00.240> mature<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.690> enough<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.380> that

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
Twilight mature is enough I think that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.750 
Twilight mature is enough I think that
she'll<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.770> able<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.980> take<00:03:02.130> both<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.370> their

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
she'll be able to take both of their

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.370 
she'll be able to take both of their
places<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.210> all<00:03:03.390> become<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> normal<00:03:04.110> cycle

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
places and all become a normal cycle

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.930 
places and all become a normal cycle
where<00:03:04.680> alicorns<00:03:05.220> don't<00:03:05.490> live<00:03:05.670> any<00:03:05.850> longer

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
where alicorns don't live any longer

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.750 
where alicorns don't live any longer

something happens where special alicorns

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.880 
something happens where special alicorns
like<00:03:14.880> celestial<00:03:15.360> una<00:03:15.780> would<00:03:15.990> be<00:03:16.140> need<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.800> be

like celestial una would be need to be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.460 
like celestial una would be need to be

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
born again and therefore the whole cycle

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.100 
born again and therefore the whole cycle
would<00:03:19.739> continue<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.820> would<00:03:21.030> live<00:03:21.390> until

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
would continue and they would live until

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.680 
would continue and they would live until
the<00:03:22.680> threat<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.220> gone<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.760> they<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.420> someone

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
the threat is gone and they have someone

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.020 
the threat is gone and they have someone
else<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.170> take<00:03:25.320> their<00:03:25.560> place<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.040> remain<00:03:26.310> keep

in this other than we know that celestia

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.479 
in this other than we know that celestia
is<00:03:36.360> at<00:03:37.320> least<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.800> been<00:03:37.980> implied<00:03:38.310> that

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
is at least it's been implied that

celestia is going to have twilight
replace<00:03:41.700> her<00:03:41.910> eventually<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:44.070> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
replace her eventually so we know that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.430 
replace her eventually so we know that
they<00:03:44.520> aren't<00:03:44.790> immortal<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.660> Celestia<00:03:46.230> will
