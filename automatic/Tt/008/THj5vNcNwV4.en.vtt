to parking into a parking spot basically
I'm<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.680> convenience<00:00:50.160> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
I'm just going for convenience of

probably going to be driving around the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.779 
probably going to be driving around the
car<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.100> power<00:00:56.100> steering<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> really

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
car a lot so power steering is really

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.549 
car a lot so power steering is really
the<00:00:57.090> only<00:00:57.300> viable<00:00:57.480> option<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.520> with<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> said

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
the only viable option so with that said

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.360 
the only viable option so with that said
we're<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> middle<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> power

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we're in the middle of the power

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.179 
we're in the middle of the power
steering<00:01:02.640> conversion<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.189> don't

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
steering conversion here and I don't

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
steering conversion here and I don't
know<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.720> bad<00:01:06.930> lighting

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
know if you could see the bad lighting

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
know if you could see the bad lighting
but<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.780> well<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.090> new

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but in there well in there is the new

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
but in there well in there is the new
power<00:01:12.479> steering<00:01:12.960> rack<00:01:13.110> joint<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:14.159> like

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
power steering rack joint or some like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
power steering rack joint or some like
to<00:01:14.430> call<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> formal<00:01:15.390> name<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.689> steering

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to call it the formal name the steering

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.359 
to call it the formal name the steering
coupler<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.759> there's<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.000> power<00:01:18.270> steering

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
coupler and there's the power steering

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.640 
coupler and there's the power steering
gearbox<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:21.060> was<00:01:21.299> harder<00:01:22.170> than<00:01:22.200> hell<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
gearbox which was harder than hell to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
gearbox which was harder than hell to
find<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> found<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
find but I found it that's from a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.050 
find but I found it that's from a
one-car<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:25.640> basically<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> bolted<00:01:27.000> right

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
one-car down basically it bolted right

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
one-car down basically it bolted right
in<00:01:27.299> where<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> manual<00:01:27.780> gearbox<00:01:28.320> went

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
in where the manual gearbox went

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
in where the manual gearbox went
connected<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> steering<00:01:30.390> joint<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
connected the steering joint or the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.010 
connected the steering joint or the
joint<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.659> basically<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:33.869> where

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
joint in there basically that's where

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
joint in there basically that's where
the<00:01:34.110> power<00:01:34.229> steering<00:01:34.619> system<00:01:34.950> since<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the power steering system since the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
the power steering system since the
return<00:01:35.670> hose<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.180> connected<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.900> the

return hose is connected and the
pressure<00:01:37.890> hose<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:38.909> know

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
pressure hose I think and I don't know

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.520 
pressure hose I think and I don't know
if<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
if you can see this or not but the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.780 
if you can see this or not but the
pressure<00:01:40.710> hood<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> hose<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> not

pressure hood is the hose is not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.630 
pressure hood is the hose is not
connected<00:01:42.240> yet<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> power<00:01:44.340> steering

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
connected yet and the power steering

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.660 
connected yet and the power steering
pump<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.119> currently<00:01:45.420> off<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> vehicle

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
types of hoses that are used the long

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.179 
types of hoses that are used the long
hose<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.600> short<00:01:57.840> hose<00:01:58.070> basically<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
hose and the short hose basically the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.850 
hose and the short hose basically the
only<00:01:59.280> difference<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> short<00:02:00.210> hose<00:02:00.860> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
only difference is the short hose it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
only difference is the short hose it
fits<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.579> easier<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.390> pretty

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
fits in there a lot easier to pretty

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
fits in there a lot easier to pretty
much<00:02:03.780> direct<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> problem<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
much direct but the problem is with the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.389 
much direct but the problem is with the
with<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> short<00:02:06.719> hoses<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
with the short hoses is is that the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
with the short hoses is is that the
power<00:02:08.789> steering<00:02:09.239> fluid<00:02:09.360> would<00:02:09.629> heat<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.989> lot

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
power steering fluid would heat up a lot

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.090 
power steering fluid would heat up a lot
more<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> longer<00:02:11.489> hose

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
more if it's in a longer hose

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.740 
more if it's in a longer hose
more<00:02:12.250> distance<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.700> travel<00:02:12.820> therefore<00:02:13.540> can

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
more distance to travel therefore can

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
more distance to travel therefore can
cool<00:02:13.900> faster<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:15.190> mount<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:16.180> mount

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
cool faster you mount this you mount

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.620 
cool faster you mount this you mount
this<00:02:16.540> long<00:02:17.410> hose<00:02:17.680> up<00:02:18.100> here<00:02:18.370> onto<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.760> brace

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
this long hose up here onto this brace

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.880 
this long hose up here onto this brace
and<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.560> allows<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.670> know<00:02:21.790> recirculating

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and it allows for you know recirculating

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.800 
and it allows for you know recirculating
fluid<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> longer<00:02:24.760> traveling<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> would<00:02:25.630> cool

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
fluid to longer traveling it would cool

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.560 
fluid to longer traveling it would cool
easier<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.910> basically<00:02:27.910> this<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.150> where<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.540> are

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
easier so basically this is where we are

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.050 
easier so basically this is where we are
so<00:02:29.910> got<00:02:30.910> our<00:02:31.000> power<00:02:31.150> steering<00:02:31.270> bracket<00:02:31.720> here

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
so got our power steering bracket here

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.100 
so got our power steering bracket here
again<00:02:34.060> don't<00:02:34.330> know<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.630> see<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.960> but

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
again don't know if you can see that but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.380 
again don't know if you can see that but
it's<00:02:35.230> freshly<00:02:35.530> painted<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.210> sitting

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's freshly painted it's just sitting

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.290 
it's freshly painted it's just sitting
here<00:02:37.570> for<00:02:37.780> now<00:02:37.930> got<00:02:38.590> my<00:02:38.740> hose<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.280> here's<00:02:40.120> our

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
here for now got my hose and here's our

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.760 
here for now got my hose and here's our
power<00:02:40.510> steering<00:02:40.900> pump<00:02:41.140> we're<00:02:41.770> going<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:41.980> use

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
power steering pump we're going to use

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.430 
power steering pump we're going to use
now<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:46.270> pump<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:48.670> typical<00:02:49.440> some

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
now this pump here is your typical some

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.870 
now this pump here is your typical some
guys<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.830> call<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.280> hand<00:02:51.580> pump

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
guys like to call it a can hand pump

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.390 
guys like to call it a can hand pump
this<00:02:52.870> pump<00:02:53.200> actually<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.130> engine

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
this pump actually was on this engine

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580 
this pump actually was on this engine
when<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.700> got<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> car<00:02:55.240> now<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.260> not<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
when I got the car now this is not the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.050 
when I got the car now this is not the
power<00:02:56.740> steering<00:02:57.070> pump<00:02:57.190> that's<00:02:57.580> used<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:57.970> these

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
power steering pump that's used on these

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.170 
power steering pump that's used on these
cars<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:59.100> this<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> better<00:03:00.550> pump<00:03:00.910> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
cars but this is a better pump and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.610 
cars but this is a better pump and
basically<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.050> only<00:03:02.110> thing<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.530> have

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
basically the only thing that you have

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.400 
basically the only thing that you have
to<00:03:02.770> do<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.970> make<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.270> pump<00:03:04.540> work<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.140> car

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
to do to make this pump work in this car

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.960 
to do to make this pump work in this car
is<00:03:05.650> create<00:03:06.070> an<00:03:06.160> adapter<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:06.640> I'm<00:03:06.820> going<00:03:06.940> to

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
is create an adapter so I'm going to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.340 
is create an adapter so I'm going to
show<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.180> how<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.330> do<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.540> now<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:07.990> let<00:03:08.320> me

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
show you how to do that now so let me

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:23.340 
show you how to do that now so let me
mount<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> camera<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:21.600> guess<00:03:22.600> that'll<00:03:23.020> work

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
mount the camera I guess that'll work

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:45.470 
mount the camera I guess that'll work
alright<00:03:39.750> okay<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:42.550> piece<00:03:42.820> right<00:03:43.060> here<00:03:43.120> is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
alright okay this piece right here is

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.940 
alright okay this piece right here is
the<00:03:46.480> piece<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.720> goes<00:03:47.080> into<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.770> power

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
the piece that goes into the power

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.830 
the piece that goes into the power
steering<00:03:48.310> pump<00:03:48.430> when<00:03:49.270> you<00:03:49.360> buy<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> power

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
steering pump when you buy a power

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.510 
steering pump when you buy a power
steering<00:03:50.200> pump<00:03:50.440> from<00:03:50.620> any<00:03:50.770> auto<00:03:50.950> parts<00:03:51.280> store

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
steering pump from any auto parts store

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.620 
steering pump from any auto parts store
it's<00:03:51.670> going<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.150> piece<00:03:52.390> already

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
it's going to have this piece already

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.090 
it's going to have this piece already
sitting<00:03:53.110> in<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.530> I'll<00:03:53.650> show<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.860> where<00:03:54.070> it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
sitting in it and I'll show you where it

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.420 
sitting in it and I'll show you where it
goes<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.460> a<00:03:54.520> minute<00:03:54.930> now<00:03:55.930> what<00:03:56.800> we<00:03:56.920> have<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.250> do

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
goes in a minute now what we have to do

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.520 
goes in a minute now what we have to do
is<00:03:57.640> if<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.270> notice<00:03:58.570> this<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> female<00:03:59.110> end

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
is if you notice this is a female end

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.620 
is if you notice this is a female end
okay

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
okay

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.760 
okay
obviously<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.660> male<00:04:01.930> end<00:04:02.110> has<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.290> go<00:04:02.530> in<00:04:02.650> here

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
obviously a male end has to go in here

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.130 
obviously a male end has to go in here
to<00:04:02.830> make<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.070> secure<00:04:03.520> fluid<00:04:04.210> type<00:04:04.390> fitting<00:04:05.790> but

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
to make a secure fluid type fitting but

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.390 
to make a secure fluid type fitting but
power<00:04:08.140> steering<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.770> as<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.130> into<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
power steering so as you get into the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.060 
power steering so as you get into the
Mustang<00:04:10.710> it's<00:04:11.710> also<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.190> female<00:04:12.580> end<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:14.350> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
Mustang it's also a female end so the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.830 
Mustang it's also a female end so the
challenge<00:04:15.520> becomes<00:04:15.880> how<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.270> make<00:04:16.450> these<00:04:16.630> two

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
challenge becomes how to make these two

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.690 
challenge becomes how to make these two
female<00:04:17.230> ends<00:04:17.440> made<00:04:17.710> up<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.460> pressure

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
female ends made up so this pressure

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.400 
female ends made up so this pressure
hose<00:04:18.970> can<00:04:19.359> go<00:04:19.510> into<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.840> power<00:04:19.989> steering<00:04:20.290> pump

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
hose can go into the power steering pump

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.030 
hose can go into the power steering pump
and<00:04:21.040> it's<00:04:21.250> done<00:04:21.520> simply<00:04:22.240> by<00:04:23.110> utilizing<00:04:23.830> a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
and it's done simply by utilizing a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.790 
and it's done simply by utilizing a
pre-made<00:04:24.940> brake<00:04:25.210> line

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
pre-made brake line

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.160 
pre-made brake line
now<00:04:27.300> it's<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.360> same<00:04:28.540> thing<00:04:28.600> as<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> power

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
now it's the same thing as a power

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.510 
now it's the same thing as a power
steering<00:04:29.470> line<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.980> will<00:04:30.070> still<00:04:30.250> hold<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
steering line it will still hold the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550 
steering line it will still hold the
same<00:04:30.700> pressure<00:04:31.000> not<00:04:31.420> more<00:04:31.600> pressure<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
same pressure not more pressure and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.050 
same pressure not more pressure and
basically<00:04:32.950> what<00:04:33.160> this<00:04:33.250> will<00:04:33.460> allow<00:04:33.610> me<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.790> do

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
basically what this will allow me to do

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.190 
basically what this will allow me to do
is<00:04:34.620> thread<00:04:35.620> male-to-female<00:04:36.660> on<00:04:37.660> my<00:04:37.930> pressure

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
is thread male-to-female on my pressure

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840 
is thread male-to-female on my pressure
side<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.070> get<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.430> thread<00:04:39.670> well

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
side so I can get that the thread well

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.070 
side so I can get that the thread well
standing<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.020> weird<00:04:41.230> position

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
standing in this weird position

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.510 
standing in this weird position
it's<00:04:44.080> basically<00:04:44.440> that'll<00:04:44.860> thread<00:04:45.070> into<00:04:45.280> there

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
it's basically that'll thread into there

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.840 
it's basically that'll thread into there
this<00:04:46.150> side<00:04:47.250> will<00:04:48.250> then<00:04:48.370> thread<00:04:48.610> into<00:04:48.760> the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
this side will then thread into the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.670 
this side will then thread into the
power<00:04:49.060> steering<00:04:49.390> side<00:04:49.690> so<00:04:50.170> it<00:04:50.290> creates<00:04:50.620> a

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
power steering side so it creates a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.470 
power steering side so it creates a
connection<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.640> what<00:04:51.790> I'm<00:04:51.880> gonna<00:04:52.000> do<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.360> I'm

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
connection and what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.450 
connection and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.660> bend<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.020> into<00:04:53.230> such<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.410> way<00:04:53.650> 90

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
going to bend it into such a way 90

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.550 
going to bend it into such a way 90
degrees<00:04:54.730> angle<00:04:54.970> up<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.260> will<00:04:56.440> actually

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
degrees angle up so this will actually

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.220 
degrees angle up so this will actually
route<00:04:57.010> correctly<00:04:57.460> so<00:04:57.820> any<00:04:58.810> guys<00:04:58.960> out<00:04:59.200> there

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
route correctly so any guys out there

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.900 
route correctly so any guys out there
doing<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.620> power<00:04:59.770> steering<00:05:00.040> conversion<00:05:00.640> on<00:05:00.730> one

of these 71 through 73 Mustangs you buy

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.960 
of these 71 through 73 Mustangs you buy
all<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.200> parts<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:06.220> get<00:05:06.310> down<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.640> putting<00:05:06.850> it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
all the parts you get down to putting it

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.630 
all the parts you get down to putting it
in<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.840> know<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.800> go<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.070> option<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> use

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
in you know you can go the option to use

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.210 
in you know you can go the option to use
it<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:09.880> stock<00:05:10.200> power<00:05:11.200> steering<00:05:11.650> pump<00:05:11.860> from

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
it the stock power steering pump from

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.310 
it the stock power steering pump from
everybody<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:12.820> talked<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.330> they<00:05:13.870> say<00:05:14.110> run

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
everybody that I talked to they say run

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.700 
everybody that I talked to they say run
the<00:05:14.470> can<00:05:14.680> hand<00:05:14.920> pump<00:05:15.210> it's<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.300> lot<00:05:16.450> better

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
the can hand pump it's a lot better

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.430 
the can hand pump it's a lot better
efficiency<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.740> lot<00:05:17.919> better<00:05:18.100> model<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.440> all

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
efficiency a lot better model and all

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.300 
efficiency a lot better model and all
you<00:05:20.530> gotta<00:05:20.680> do<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.800> make<00:05:21.010> one<00:05:21.160> of<00:05:21.250> these

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
you gotta do is make one of these

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.450 
you gotta do is make one of these
adapters<00:05:21.850> so<00:05:21.880> in<00:05:22.630> my<00:05:22.750> next<00:05:22.960> video<00:05:23.260> I'm<00:05:24.220> gonna

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
adapters so in my next video I'm gonna

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.920 
adapters so in my next video I'm gonna
go<00:05:24.550> ahead<00:05:24.640> and<00:05:24.730> illustrate<00:05:24.880> how<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.570> get<00:05:25.750> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
go ahead and illustrate how I get the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.490 
go ahead and illustrate how I get the
adapter<00:05:26.169> made<00:05:27.600> kind<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.660> go<00:05:28.780> through<00:05:29.020> the

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
adapter made kind of go through the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.650 
adapter made kind of go through the
steps<00:05:29.770> you<00:05:30.070> know<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> used<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.300> do<00:05:31.510> it

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
steps you know that I used to do it

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.960 
steps you know that I used to do it
somebody<00:05:31.900> some<00:05:32.410> people<00:05:32.620> may<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:32.860> know<00:05:33.010> how<00:05:33.910> to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
somebody some people may not know how to

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.850 
somebody some people may not know how to
work<00:05:34.150> with<00:05:34.330> brake<00:05:34.570> line<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.110> then<00:05:35.620> I'm<00:05:35.740> going

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
work with brake line and then I'm going

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.370 
work with brake line and then I'm going
to<00:05:35.890> go<00:05:36.010> ahead<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.340> mount<00:05:36.460> this<00:05:36.669> pump<00:05:37.000> and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
to go ahead and mount this pump and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.480 
to go ahead and mount this pump and
connect<00:05:38.380> all<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> hoses<00:05:38.770> up<00:05:39.040> fill<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.280> up<00:05:39.370> with

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
connect all the hoses up fill it up with

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.920 
connect all the hoses up fill it up with
some<00:05:39.640> fluid<00:05:40.000> let's<00:05:40.330> see<00:05:40.480> if<00:05:40.540> we<00:05:40.660> have<00:05:40.750> power

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
some fluid let's see if we have power

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.920 
some fluid let's see if we have power
steering<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:41.590> until<00:05:42.400> then<00:05:42.550> guys<00:05:42.729> will<00:05:43.450> Chad

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
steering so until then guys will Chad

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.410 
steering so until then guys will Chad
etch<00:05:44.080> a<00:05:44.110> liter
