00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.479 
not as good as those pair that new yura
beats<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.989> these<00:02:10.140> were<00:02:10.319> definitely<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.370> know

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
beats but these were definitely you know

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.300 
beats but these were definitely you know
nice<00:02:11.730> there's<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.599> one

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
nice there's this one

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.729 
nice there's this one
thing<00:02:13.580> about<00:02:13.700> these<00:02:14.030> they<00:02:14.810> leak<00:02:15.110> they<00:02:15.440> leak<00:02:15.650> a

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
thing about these they leak they leak a

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.120 
thing about these they leak they leak a
lot<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.480> that's<00:02:17.480> why<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.780> would<00:02:17.959> recommend<00:02:18.130> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
lot and that's why I would recommend the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.070 
lot and that's why I would recommend the
Skullcandy<00:02:19.760> Titans<00:02:20.270> because<00:02:20.569> those<00:02:20.780> come<00:02:20.989> in

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
Skullcandy Titans because those come in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.820 
Skullcandy Titans because those come in
alumina<00:02:21.530> aluminum<00:02:22.250> housing<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.650> they<00:02:24.650> don't

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
alumina aluminum housing and they don't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.890 
alumina aluminum housing and they don't
leak<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.190> much<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.880> when<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.420> put<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> gel

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
leak that much and when you put the gel

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.720 
leak that much and when you put the gel
super<00:02:27.290> tips<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> aluminum<00:02:28.099> housing<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
super tips on the aluminum housing the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.320 
super tips on the aluminum housing the
Skullcandy

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
Skullcandy

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.710 
Skullcandy
they<00:02:29.630> don't<00:02:29.840> leak<00:02:30.019> at<00:02:30.830> all<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.550> these<00:02:32.300> these

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
they don't leak at all and these these

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.040 
they don't leak at all and these these
are<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.800> soft<00:02:34.459> plastic<00:02:35.050> very

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
are like a like a soft plastic very

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.449 
are like a like a soft plastic very
similar<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> plastic<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.360> here<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.769> it

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
similar to the plastic on here and it

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.240 
similar to the plastic on here and it
does<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.150> does<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.110> part<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.709> aluminum

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
does it does have this part is aluminum

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.699 
does it does have this part is aluminum
right<00:02:43.580> here<00:02:43.849> or<00:02:44.000> metal<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> rest<00:02:45.470> is

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
right here or metal but the rest is

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.830 
right here or metal but the rest is
plastic<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:46.850> that's<00:02:47.180> where<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> trouble

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
plastic and so that's where the trouble

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.350 
plastic and so that's where the trouble
comes<00:02:47.870> they<00:02:48.590> leak<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.010> lot<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:49.970> sound

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
comes they leak a lot but they sound

we're gonna start the volume off at

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.479 
we're gonna start the volume off at
we're<00:03:11.840> gonna<00:03:11.900> start<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.319> up<00:03:12.470> at<00:03:12.739> let's<00:03:13.280> see

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
we're gonna start it up at let's see

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:22.420 
we're gonna start it up at let's see
let's<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:18.790> that's<00:03:19.790> 75%<00:03:20.560> okay<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.890> then

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
let's go up to that's 75% okay and then

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.840 
let's go up to that's 75% okay and then
we<00:03:22.519> have<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.880> on<00:03:23.890> dances<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.010> preset<00:03:25.489> and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
we have it on dances the preset and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.300 
we have it on dances the preset and
that's<00:03:26.000> pretty<00:03:26.329> much<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.890> I'd<00:03:27.890> say<00:03:28.100> that's

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
that's pretty much the I'd say that's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.539 
that's pretty much the I'd say that's
the<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.910> best<00:03:29.180> one<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:29.690> as<00:03:29.870> far<00:03:30.079> as<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the the best one like as far as the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.550 
the the best one like as far as the
soundcheck<00:03:31.549> it's<00:03:32.510> got<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> lot<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.959> bass<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.440> it

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
soundcheck it's got a lot of bass to it

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.979 
soundcheck it's got a lot of bass to it
like<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.739> lot<00:03:33.799> like<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.430> lot<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.730> electronic<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
like a lot like a lot of electronic and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.410 
like a lot like a lot of electronic and
it's<00:03:36.680> got<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.010> trebles<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:37.609> as<00:03:37.970> opposed<00:03:38.359> to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
it's got the trebles there as opposed to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.319 
it's got the trebles there as opposed to
just<00:03:38.569> bass<00:03:38.840> boost<00:03:39.230> or<00:03:39.440> something<00:03:39.470> like<00:03:39.829> that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
just bass boost or something like that

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.910 
just bass boost or something like that
so<00:03:41.500> let's<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.620> into<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.660> leak<00:03:44.660> test<00:03:44.989> now

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
so let's get into this leak test now

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.020 
so let's get into this leak test now
they<00:03:46.250> sound<00:03:46.579> loud<00:03:47.000> they<00:03:47.239> sound<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.200> good

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
they sound loud they sound so good

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.640 
they sound loud they sound so good
that's<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.450> one<00:03:50.690> thing<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.170> kills<00:03:51.410> me

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
that's just the one thing that kills me

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.900 
that's just the one thing that kills me
that<00:03:51.680> they<00:03:51.950> leak<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.400> why<00:03:52.609> couldn't<00:03:52.670> they

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that they leak like why couldn't they

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.690 
that they leak like why couldn't they
just<00:03:53.090> make<00:03:53.239> this<00:03:53.359> a<00:03:53.630> hole<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.889> all<00:03:55.100> aluminum

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
just make this a hole like all aluminum

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.220 
just make this a hole like all aluminum
housing<00:03:56.120> right<00:03:56.269> here<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.660> like<00:03:56.720> charge<00:03:57.049> maybe

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
housing right here and like charge maybe

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.319 
housing right here and like charge maybe
ten<00:03:57.560> dollars<00:03:57.889> more<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.850> you<00:03:58.910> could<00:03:59.150> just

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
ten dollars more so you could just

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.309 
ten dollars more so you could just
eliminate<00:03:59.630> the<00:04:00.019> sound<00:04:00.260> leakage<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:02.319> don't

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
eliminate the sound leakage so I don't

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.629 
eliminate the sound leakage so I don't
know<00:04:03.410> maybe<00:04:03.620> they'll<00:04:03.829> do<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:04.069> you<00:04:04.519> know

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
know maybe they'll do that you know

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.190 
know maybe they'll do that you know
that's<00:04:04.819> what<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.060> skull<00:04:05.299> can<00:04:05.480> use<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.750> for<00:04:05.930> and

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
that's what the skull can use it for and

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.000 
that's what the skull can use it for and
the<00:04:06.560> Full<00:04:06.769> Metal<00:04:06.920> Jacket<00:04:07.069> I<00:04:07.700> guess<00:04:08.510> but<00:04:09.200> if<00:04:09.530> you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
the Full Metal Jacket I guess but if you

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.559 
the Full Metal Jacket I guess but if you
want<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.340> have<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:11.030> know<00:04:11.150> they<00:04:11.359> could<00:04:11.540> just

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
want to have you know they could just

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.050 
want to have you know they could just
five<00:04:12.380> or<00:04:12.410> ten<00:04:12.769> more<00:04:12.920> bucks<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.459> then<00:04:13.850> make<00:04:13.970> it

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
five or ten more bucks and then make it

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.610 
five or ten more bucks and then make it
all<00:04:14.180> metal<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:15.609> let's<00:04:16.609> get<00:04:16.700> into<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.090> sound

very I was just very intrigued by these

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.290 
very I was just very intrigued by these
because<00:05:59.140> they<00:05:59.260> said<00:05:59.470> they<00:05:59.590> had<00:05:59.770> a<00:06:00.030> this<00:06:01.030> part

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
because they said they had a this part

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.930 
because they said they had a this part
was<00:06:01.450> metal<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:02.050> then<00:06:02.620> this<00:06:02.800> like<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.580> lot<00:06:03.820> of

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
was metal and then this like a lot of

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.860 
was metal and then this like a lot of
headphones<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.390> I've<00:06:04.510> been<00:06:04.630> getting

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
headphones that I've been getting

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.420 
headphones that I've been getting
recently<00:06:05.080> had<00:06:05.500> been<00:06:05.680> plastic<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.370> they

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
recently had been plastic and they

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.370 
recently had been plastic and they
haven't<00:06:06.640> been<00:06:06.880> leaking<00:06:07.120> as<00:06:07.420> much<00:06:07.600> so<00:06:08.350> I

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
haven't been leaking as much so I

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.730 
haven't been leaking as much so I
figured<00:06:08.890> that<00:06:09.610> maybe<00:06:09.970> that<00:06:10.780> these<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:11.620> know

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
figured that maybe that these you know

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.010 
figured that maybe that these you know
wouldn't<00:06:12.070> leak<00:06:12.220> but<00:06:12.520> they<00:06:13.000> get<00:06:13.240> they<00:06:13.510> get<00:06:13.690> so

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
wouldn't leak but they get they get so

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.130 
wouldn't leak but they get they get so
loud<00:06:14.290> that<00:06:14.830> they<00:06:15.040> do<00:06:15.100> they<00:06:15.520> they<00:06:16.000> just<00:06:16.420> have<00:06:16.960> to

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
loud that they do they they just have to

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.120 
loud that they do they they just have to
leak<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:18.040> if<00:06:18.900> you<00:06:19.900> know<00:06:19.990> if<00:06:20.170> you<00:06:20.320> if<00:06:20.350> if<00:06:20.920> you're

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
leak so if you know if you if if you're

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.250 
leak so if you know if you if if you're
like<00:06:21.280> me<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.640> the<00:06:21.910> leakage<00:06:22.300> matters<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.930> you

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260
