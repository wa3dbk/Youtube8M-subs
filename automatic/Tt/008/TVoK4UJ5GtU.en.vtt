00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:30.540 

three<00:01:14.060> point<00:01:14.420> 25

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.760 

three-point<00:01:31.550> 41

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.420 

hey<00:01:39.770> guys<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.369> um<00:01:40.610> after<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.719> speed<00:01:42.020> trial<00:01:42.430> we

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
hey guys so um after the speed trial we

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.660 
hey guys so um after the speed trial we
are<00:01:43.820> times<00:01:44.360> where<00:01:45.880> 322<00:01:46.990> 325<00:01:47.990> or<00:01:48.409> three<00:01:49.310> point

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
are times where 322 325 or three point

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.029 
are times where 322 325 or three point
22<00:01:50.060> three<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:51.229> 25<00:01:52.869> 3<00:01:53.869> point<00:01:54.140> 13<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.860> 3

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
22 three point 25 3 point 13 and 3

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.919 
22 three point 25 3 point 13 and 3
points<00:01:55.490> point<00:01:56.149> 41<00:01:56.929> one<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.950> reasons<00:01:58.340> why

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
points point 41 one of the reasons why

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:06.940 
points point 41 one of the reasons why
um<00:02:00.549> so<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:02.289> averaged<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.560> out<00:02:03.909> 23<00:02:04.909> point<00:02:05.500> 23<00:02:06.500> and

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
um so I averaged it out 23 point 23 and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.650 
um so I averaged it out 23 point 23 and
then<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.369> would<00:02:07.549> be<00:02:07.670> point<00:02:07.939> five<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:08.390> three

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
then it would be point five but three

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.699 
then it would be point five but three
point<00:02:09.200> 23<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:12.519> it's<00:02:13.519> roughly<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.709> 22

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
point 23 so then it's roughly in the 22

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.890 
point 23 so then it's roughly in the 22
mile<00:02:16.099> per<00:02:16.459> hour<00:02:16.519> range<00:02:16.970> i'll<00:02:17.330> probably<00:02:17.599> take

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
mile per hour range i'll probably take

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.110 
mile per hour range i'll probably take
that<00:02:18.230> inside<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.630> official

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that inside and do like an official

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.069 
that inside and do like an official
count<00:02:23.120> ah<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.440> yeah
