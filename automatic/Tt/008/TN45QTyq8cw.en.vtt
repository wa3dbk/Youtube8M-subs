want that rolling just to be even just
about<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> top<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.220> bridge<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
about with the top of the bridge so the

that means that the string height is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.830

shot we're looking for the straightedge
to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.379> just<00:03:16.739> even<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.580> top<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
bridge that would mean that the string

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470 
bridge that would mean that the string
height<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:22.250> completely<00:03:23.250> adjusted<00:03:23.849> by<00:03:24.450> the

making a difference in the string height
okay<00:03:31.110> now<00:03:31.379> we've<00:03:31.590> got<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.099> strings<00:03:32.430> on

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
okay now we've got all the strings on

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.930 
okay now we've got all the strings on
and<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.180> tuned<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.780> pitch<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.220> we're<00:03:35.819> going

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
and it's tuned the pitch and we're going

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.449 
and it's tuned the pitch and we're going
to<00:03:36.000> check<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.540> spacing<00:03:37.379> at<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.680> first<00:03:38.160> fret

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
to check the spacing at the first fret

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.539 
to check the spacing at the first fret
and<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.900> slide<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.290> point<00:03:41.010> four<00:03:41.310> six

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
and as I slide my point four six

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.699 
and as I slide my point four six
millimeter<00:03:42.090> pick<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:42.690> there's<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.440> nice

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
millimeter pick in there there's a nice

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
millimeter pick in there there's a nice
drag<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:44.910> all<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> want

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
drag on it and that's all I want

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.370 
drag on it and that's all I want
same<00:03:46.739> thing<00:03:47.069> for<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> next<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:48.349> same<00:03:49.349> thing

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
same thing for the next one same thing

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.580 
same thing for the next one same thing
for<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.980> next<00:03:50.160> one<00:03:50.810> pull<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.900> out<00:03:52.079> we'll<00:03:52.380> check

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
for the next one pull it out we'll check

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.750 
for the next one pull it out we'll check
on<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.860> other<00:03:53.010> side<00:03:53.720> slight<00:03:54.720> drag<00:03:55.760> we're

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
on the other side slight drag we're

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.000 
on the other side slight drag we're
doing<00:03:57.030> good<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.750> were<00:03:57.900> able<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.290> drop<00:03:58.709> this

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
doing good so we were able to drop this

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.180 
doing good so we were able to drop this
height<00:03:59.299> to<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.390> right<00:04:00.599> amount<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.260> at<00:04:02.069> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
height to the right amount and at the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.110 
height to the right amount and at the
same<00:04:02.370> time<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.879> lubricated<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.790> slots<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
same time we lubricated the slots in the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.330 
same time we lubricated the slots in the
nut<00:04:06.420> for<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> strings<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.530> won't<00:04:07.829> squeak

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
nut for the strings so they won't squeak

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.780 
nut for the strings so they won't squeak
when<00:04:08.610> we<00:04:08.730> start<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.150> tighten<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.599> them<00:04:09.720> up<00:04:09.840> I

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
when we start to tighten it them up I

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.059 
when we start to tighten it them up I
did<00:04:11.790> tweak<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.480> truss<00:04:12.810> rod<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.140> little<00:04:13.349> bit<00:04:13.739> so

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
did tweak the truss rod a little bit so

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.250 
did tweak the truss rod a little bit so
if<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.250> press<00:04:14.430> down<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.790> first<00:04:15.209> fret<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.750> I

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
if I press down the first fret and I

if I press down the first fret and I
press<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.919> 14th<00:04:17.370> fret<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:19.560> have<00:04:20.340> just

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
press down the 14th fret and I have just

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.090 
press down the 14th fret and I have just
enough<00:04:21.150> space<00:04:21.419> under<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> sixth<00:04:22.380> fret<00:04:22.500> to

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
enough space under the sixth fret to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.670 
enough space under the sixth fret to
give<00:04:23.280> me<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> little<00:04:23.760> bit<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:24.030> relief<00:04:24.410> if<00:04:25.410> it

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
give me a little bit of relief if it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.740 
give me a little bit of relief if it
buzzed<00:04:25.979> at<00:04:26.280> all<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.490> could<00:04:27.030> only<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.570> could

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
buzzed at all I could only I could

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.930 
buzzed at all I could only I could
always<00:04:27.960> back<00:04:28.500> off<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.919> truss<00:04:29.160> rod<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.820> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
always back off the truss rod just a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.060 
always back off the truss rod just a
little<00:04:30.210> bit<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.870> control<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.470> relief<00:04:31.830> that's

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
little bit to control the relief that's

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.850 
little bit to control the relief that's
what<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.460> truss<00:04:32.729> rod<00:04:32.849> is<00:04:33.210> for<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.620> last

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
what the truss rod is for and the last

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.589 
what the truss rod is for and the last
thing<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:35.190> going<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.460> check<00:04:35.700> is<00:04:35.970> I'm<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.479> to

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
thing I'm going to check is I'm going to

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.339 
thing I'm going to check is I'm going to
check<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.530> make<00:04:37.560> sure<00:04:37.740> there's<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.220> brake<00:04:38.580> angle

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
check to make sure there's a brake angle

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.760 
check to make sure there's a brake angle
for<00:04:40.349> each<00:04:40.590> string<00:04:41.070> over<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.450> saddle<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.530> I

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
for each string over the saddle if I

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.040 
for each string over the saddle if I
didn't<00:04:44.130> have<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:44.400> brake<00:04:44.760> angle<00:04:45.240> or<00:04:45.450> downward

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
didn't have this brake angle or downward

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.260 
didn't have this brake angle or downward
slope<00:04:46.440> we'd<00:04:47.310> have<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.550> problem<00:04:47.849> it<00:04:48.120> would

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
slope we'd have a problem it would

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.240 
slope we'd have a problem it would
probably<00:04:48.900> buzz<00:04:49.110> there<00:04:49.410> but<00:04:49.620> we<00:04:49.740> have<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:49.950> brake

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
probably buzz there but we have a brake

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.800 
probably buzz there but we have a brake
angle<00:04:50.700> over<00:04:51.389> each<00:04:51.919> part<00:04:52.919> of<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.490> saddle<00:04:54.060> so

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
angle over each part of the saddle so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.430 
angle over each part of the saddle so
this<00:04:55.080> guitar<00:04:55.440> should<00:04:55.710> be<00:04:55.830> all<00:04:56.010> set<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.280> go
