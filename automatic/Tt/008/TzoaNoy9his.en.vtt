so what I phones could be a lot factory

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.910 
so what I phones could be a lot factory
unlocked<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.190> course<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.110> gsm<00:00:58.710> only

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
unlocked of course it is the gsm only

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.630 
unlocked of course it is the gsm only
meaning<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.240> that<00:01:00.420> takes<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.810> sim<00:01:01.050> card

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
well I guess I'll then take sim cards in

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.990 
well I guess I'll then take sim cards in
some<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.180> another<00:01:06.650> it<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.280> AT&amp;T<00:01:08.640> one

some way or another it is the AT&amp;T one
basically<00:01:09.570> those<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.620> only<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
basically those are the only one that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
basically those are the only one that
can<00:01:11.370> be<00:01:11.430> factored<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> long<00:01:12.600> time<00:01:12.930> there<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
can be factored in a long time there is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.190 
can be factored in a long time there is
reports<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:16.200> cdma<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:18.080> some<00:01:19.080> of
