something that hopefully you could all
try<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.090> use<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.099> it'd<00:00:14.099> make<00:00:14.280> things<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
try and use and it'd make things a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.240 
try and use and it'd make things a
little<00:00:14.610> bit<00:00:14.759> easier<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> basically<00:00:16.920> all<00:00:17.070> I've

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
little bit easier so basically all I've

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.480 
little bit easier so basically all I've
got<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.699> pulley<00:00:18.480> system<00:00:18.960> two<00:00:19.920> pulleys<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
got as pulley system two pulleys at the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.689 
got as pulley system two pulleys at the
back<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> front<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> cables<00:00:23.490> go

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
back to at the front all the cables go

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.240 
back to at the front all the cables go
down<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.359> eyes<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> wall<00:00:25.650> obviously

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
down to two eyes on the wall obviously

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
down to two eyes on the wall obviously
this<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.730> painted<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> can't

this little get painted up so you can't
see<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.109> properly<00:00:29.029> comes<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
see it all properly comes down to a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.400 
see it all properly comes down to a
point<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.160> place<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> too<00:00:32.700> Scott<00:00:33.410> pretty

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
point and I place you too Scott pretty

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.520 
point and I place you too Scott pretty
easy<00:00:34.590> mechanism<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.110> comes<00:00:37.260> down

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
easy mechanism there and it comes down

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.389 
easy mechanism there and it comes down
to<00:00:37.829> winch<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> got<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> an<00:00:39.390> atv<00:00:39.899> winch

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
to winch so I got it's an atv winch

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.030 
to winch so I got it's an atv winch
Kennex<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> lift<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.320> 1500<00:00:43.320> kg<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
Kennex you lift up to 1500 kg that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
Kennex you lift up to 1500 kg that
obviously<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.670> need<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> lift<00:00:45.059> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
obviously we don't need to lift that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
obviously we don't need to lift that
much<00:00:46.160> there's<00:00:47.160> only<00:00:47.250> ninety<00:00:47.520> nine<00:00:47.640> dollars

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
much there's only ninety nine dollars

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
much there's only ninety nine dollars
online<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.719> reasonably<00:00:49.620> cheap<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.920> pick<00:00:50.070> up

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
online so reasonably cheap to pick up

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
online so reasonably cheap to pick up
again<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> whole<00:00:51.090> system<00:00:51.480> will<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.690> boxed

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
again this whole system will get boxed

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.450 
again this whole system will get boxed
and<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> can't<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> boxes

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and so you can't see it but the boxes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.720 
and so you can't see it but the boxes
are<00:00:53.520> near<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:55.020> how<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.379> working

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
are near so you can see how it's working

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
are near so you can see how it's working
talk<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.059> operator<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.960> actually

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
hit these batteries to sit on charge all

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
hit these batteries to sit on charge all
the<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.449> last<00:01:00.719> quite<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> few<00:01:01.289> years<00:01:01.530> just

it through the holes that are already

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
it through the holes that are already
existing<00:01:57.899> once<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> bolts<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.770> so

taking all the bolts out already fronts

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.709 
taking all the bolts out already fronts
off<00:02:02.460> already<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.969> guys<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.329> how<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.689> that

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
off already you guys know how to do that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.459 
off already you guys know how to do that
and<00:02:04.159> I'll<00:02:05.159> show<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> works<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.469> little

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and I'll show you how it works a little

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
and I'll show you how it works a little
bit<00:02:07.649> noisy<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.610> him<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> day<00:02:09.090> he

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
bit noisy but you know him the day he

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
bit noisy but you know him the day he
only<00:02:09.450> using<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.020> five<00:02:10.170> seconds<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> then

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
only using it for five seconds and then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.380 
only using it for five seconds and then
you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> take<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> off<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.819> leave<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you can take it off and leave it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:30.949 
you can take it off and leave it
so<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.440> wasn't<00:02:13.650> show<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.860> how<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.069> looks<00:02:29.959> simple

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
so I wasn't show you how it looks simple

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.570 
so I wasn't show you how it looks simple
as<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.940> obviously<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:34.890> high

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
as that obviously you can do it as high

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340 
as that obviously you can do it as high
as<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.850> want<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.360> don't<00:02:36.390> want<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.990> set<00:02:37.200> up

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
too high just enough so you can drive

00:02:39.600 --> 00:03:03.600 
too high just enough so you can drive
out<00:02:39.810> which<00:02:40.290> I'll<00:02:40.470> show<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> simple<00:02:41.400> s
