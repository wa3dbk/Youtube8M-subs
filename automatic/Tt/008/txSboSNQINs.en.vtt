very<00:02:05.899> soon<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.320> realized<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.040> there's<00:02:07.250> no

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
very soon I realized that there's no

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.389 
very soon I realized that there's no
actually<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.599> need<00:02:08.690> know<00:02:09.170> how<00:02:09.410> I'll<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.190> work

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
actually I need know how I'll to work

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.920 
actually I need know how I'll to work
with<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.729> cardboard<00:02:11.030> beside<00:02:11.510> making

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
with the cardboard beside making

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.570 
with the cardboard beside making
packages<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.069> started<00:02:16.459> to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
packages out of it so I started to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.240 
packages out of it so I started to
explore<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.440> figure<00:02:18.800> out<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> lot

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
explore it and then I figure out a lot

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:31.690 
explore it and then I figure out a lot
of<00:02:19.310> things<00:02:19.640> outfit<00:02:29.980> basically<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.130> idea<00:02:31.459> is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
of things outfit basically the idea is

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.539 
of things outfit basically the idea is
like<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.970> Japanese<00:02:32.599> origami<00:02:33.100> fold<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.250> once

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
like a Japanese origami fold it once

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.059 
like a Japanese origami fold it once
then<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.600> doesn't<00:02:36.019> come<00:02:36.170> twice<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.799> strong

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
then it doesn't come twice the strong

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.920 
then it doesn't come twice the strong
it's<00:02:37.220> almost<00:02:37.459> three<00:02:37.730> times<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.090> strength<00:02:38.450> so

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it's almost three times the strength so

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.680 
it's almost three times the strength so
that's<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.380> took<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.830> from<00:02:40.010> there<00:02:40.340> and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that's I took it from there and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.420 
that's I took it from there and
basically<00:02:41.690> do<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.769> same<00:02:42.799> thing<00:02:43.250> with

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
basically do the same thing with

00:02:43.430 --> 00:03:02.770 
basically do the same thing with
cardboard

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.530 

my<00:03:03.780> first<00:03:04.109> operational<00:03:04.980> prototype<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.239> looks

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
my first operational prototype it looks

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.470 
my first operational prototype it looks
like<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> hybrid<00:03:07.379> between<00:03:07.849> packaging<00:03:08.849> box<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
like a hybrid between packaging box and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.849 
like a hybrid between packaging box and
sort<00:03:10.409> of<00:03:10.469> bicycles<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.109> was<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.319> package<00:03:13.590> on

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
sort of bicycles so it was a package on

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:14.360 
sort of bicycles so it was a package on
wheels

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
wheels

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.119 
wheels
pretty<00:03:14.700> much<00:03:14.909> then<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> realized<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.799> had<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
pretty much then I realized it had to

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.390 
pretty much then I realized it had to
look<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> real<00:03:17.819> bicycles<00:03:18.480> how<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.400> take

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
look like a real bicycles how to take

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
look like a real bicycles how to take
this<00:03:20.609> cardboard<00:03:21.389> box<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:22.170> turn<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.950> into

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
this cardboard box and turn it into

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.530 
this cardboard box and turn it into
ordinary<00:03:24.420> bicycles<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.670> that's<00:03:26.939> where

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
ordinary bicycles and so that's where

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:47.990 
ordinary bicycles and so that's where
the<00:03:27.900> real<00:03:28.230> challenges<00:03:28.980> started<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:46.700> did<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.730> lot

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
the real challenges started I did a lot

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.490 
the real challenges started I did a lot
of<00:03:48.120> things<00:03:48.329> in<00:03:48.510> my<00:03:48.659> life<00:03:49.219> working<00:03:50.219> with<00:03:50.430> robots

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
of things in my life working with robots

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.309 
of things in my life working with robots
which<00:03:52.500> stands<00:03:53.840> electromechanical<00:03:54.840> machine

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
which stands electromechanical machine

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.849 
which stands electromechanical machine
er<00:03:55.650> II<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:57.359> basically<00:03:57.599> took<00:03:58.109> everything<00:03:58.530> I

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
er II and I basically took everything I

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.429 
er II and I basically took everything I
knew<00:03:59.099> and<00:03:59.430> focus<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.659> work<00:04:00.870> with<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
knew and focus it to work with that

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.539 
knew and focus it to work with that
material<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:03.739> accomplish<00:04:04.739> what<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> wanted<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
material to accomplish what I wanted to

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.850 
material to accomplish what I wanted to
do

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
do

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.300 
do
wiill<00:04:07.860> structures<00:04:09.200> frame<00:04:10.200> design<00:04:10.830> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
wiill structures frame design and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.009 
wiill structures frame design and
strength<00:04:13.010> transmission<00:04:14.010> parts<00:04:14.780> cut<00:04:15.780> both

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
strength transmission parts cut both

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:32.659 
strength transmission parts cut both
seat

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.339 

and<00:04:33.669> then<00:04:34.300> things<00:04:34.599> started<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.990> click

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
and then things started to click

00:04:35.349 --> 00:05:13.159 
and then things started to click
together

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:31.000 

it's<00:05:13.530> strong<00:05:15.590> its<00:05:16.590> durable<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:19.590> cheap

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.840 

what<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:31.670> like<00:05:31.940> about<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.540> the<00:05:32.570> most<00:05:33.430> it's<00:05:34.430> made

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
what I like about it the most it's made

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:47.290 
what I like about it the most it's made
out<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.060> cardboard

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.170 

you

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.240 

you
