have to vote you don't adjust it that
much<00:03:37.659> although<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:38.620> head<00:03:38.889> on<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.159> does<00:03:39.370> have<00:03:39.579> a

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
much although the head on it does have a

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.539 
much although the head on it does have a
nice<00:03:39.760> little<00:03:39.940> rotation<00:03:40.389> I'd<00:03:41.139> say<00:03:41.319> it's<00:03:41.349> about

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
nice little rotation I'd say it's about

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.670 
nice little rotation I'd say it's about
it's<00:03:42.549> about<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.760> 90<00:03:43.209> degree<00:03:43.299> rotation<00:03:43.930> on<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
it's about a 90 degree rotation on it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.759 
it's about a 90 degree rotation on it
