coming<00:00:25.830> together<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.750> feel

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
coming together as I want it to feel

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.349 
coming together as I want it to feel
like<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.580> don't<00:00:30.269> know

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
like with these it's like I don't know

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.880 
like with these it's like I don't know
it<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.810> kind<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.109> hard<00:00:31.320> because<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.769> you're

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it can be kind of hard because if you're

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
it can be kind of hard because if you're
wearing<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.309> heels<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.780> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
wearing with heels you have to be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.450 
wearing with heels you have to be
careful<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> wear<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.370> because

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
careful of how you wear them because

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.490 
careful of how you wear them because
they<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.450> too<00:00:36.630> sexy<00:00:37.079> sexy

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
they might be a little bit too sexy sexy

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
they might be a little bit too sexy sexy
most<00:00:37.800> ideal<00:00:38.399> would<00:00:38.670> probably<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.540> wear

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
most ideal would probably be to wear

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.540 
most ideal would probably be to wear
them<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.230> flats<00:00:40.530> however<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.370> don't

for whenever I go running because it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
for whenever I go running because it's
cold<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.909> take<00:01:45.119> off<00:01:45.360> my

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
cold I don't want to have to take off my
glove<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> touchscreen<00:01:47.250> glove

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
glove if it's not a touchscreen glove

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.010 
glove if it's not a touchscreen glove
and<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.970> probably<00:01:48.240> should<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> these

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
and I probably should get more of these
there<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> lot<00:01:49.710> better<00:01:49.860> quality<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> one's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there is a lot better quality of one's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.069 
there is a lot better quality of one's
out<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.479> these<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.720> only<00:01:51.810> three

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
out there but these are only three

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.270 
out there but these are only three
dollars<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.530> i<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.130> awesome

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

this<00:02:41.250> um<00:02:42.230> before<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.400> loving

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
this um before that I was really loving

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.790 
this um before that I was really loving
maybelline<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> falsies<00:02:45.800> waterproof

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
maybelline the falsies waterproof

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.790 
maybelline the falsies waterproof
mascara<00:02:47.700> um<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.420> feel<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.230> formula

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
mascara um I just feel like the formula

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.130 
mascara um I just feel like the formula
really<00:02:50.700> works<00:02:50.910> for<00:02:51.120> my<00:02:51.210> eyelashes<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:51.930> I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
really works for my eyelashes because I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.200 
really works for my eyelashes because I
do<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.320> more<00:02:52.920> straight<00:02:53.310> haired<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.060> it

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
do have more straight haired so it

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.840 
do have more straight haired so it
really<00:02:54.360> helps<00:02:54.840> hold<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> curl<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.100> with

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
really helps hold the curl up but with

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.390 
really helps hold the curl up but with
this<00:02:57.090> um<00:02:57.450> since<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.410> waterproof<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
this um since it is waterproof the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
this um since it is waterproof the
formula<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.210> be<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.390> little<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.050> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
formula can be a little bit like it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
formula can be a little bit like it
feels<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.590> little<00:03:01.650> waxy<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.250> sticky<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.060> me<00:03:03.210> i'm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
feels a little waxy and sticky to me i'm

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.000

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.320 
good again it's not too much of a scent
which<00:07:04.680> I<00:07:04.830> like<00:07:05.039> because<00:07:05.220> I<00:07:05.820> don't<00:07:06.240> have

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
which I like because I don't have

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.960 
which I like because I don't have
allergies<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:06.990> so<00:07:07.259> I'm<00:07:07.380> really<00:07:07.800> sensitive<00:07:08.130> to

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
allergies and so I'm really sensitive to

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.360 
allergies and so I'm really sensitive to

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
sense sometimes so I do like these

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.520 
sense sometimes so I do like these

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
because it's just not overbearing so

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.930
