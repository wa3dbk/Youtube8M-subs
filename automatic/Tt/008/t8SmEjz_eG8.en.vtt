00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.080
Hi there. My name is Ikuo and I'm a bassist. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.280
Recently, my band, BULL ZEICHEN 88
 released our first album...   

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.280
...and the album title is actually "Album."

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.330
So that's been freshly released.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.280
Now we're on tour. 
So that's what we've been up to.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.200
Other than that, I've been working with
 T.M. Revolution, Abingdon Boys School... 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.280
...on a regular basis.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.980
I've also been recording a lot, and doing
 Jazz sessions.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.680
Keeping myself busy with different things.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.570
Today, I'll talk about what I use for
 live sessions and recordings.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.690
About my bass, amp, effects,
and everything else.  

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.980
I will show you my gears.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.980

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.090
This is what I currently use.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.180
It's Markbass.
I'm a Markbass user. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.530
On the mount, there are two heads.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.890
There are two because one is the main
 and the other is the sub.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.740
Basically, a spare.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.170
This one is a regular Transistor.
 The one on the top.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.320
The other one is pre-tube.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.250
The pre-tube makes the sound
 a little more boomy.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.480
I tend to use the effects to distort the sound
 so I like using the pure transistor. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.060
This is an old model called the SA450,
 but I use this as my main.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.140
They also have the MoMark.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.350
It's a combination module from Markbass. 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.940
It has the equalizer, EQ, and the power amp.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.450
They put all of that together to make one amp head.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.030
It's called MoMark and I use it often during tours.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.170
I have about a total of 5.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.280
Here's the cabinet I brought today.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.360
It's a model with 15' speaker and a tweeter.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.020
I use this for recordings and
 sessions in the small room. 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.670
This cabinet works really well in that setting. 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.670
This is 15' so the lows come out very nicely
 and the tweeters work very well too. 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.710
So the slaps come out very clearly.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.180
It's light so it's very portable as well.
I value it a lot.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.780

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.660
On to the cables.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.470
I use the cables from Ex-Pro. 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.210
The main that I use is this blue one. 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.750
This is the FL-Series from Ex-Pro.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:49.020
It's not too thick, and it actually does not
 produce a lot of lows. 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.490
I know usually you'd want to get a bigger
 low sound for a bass...

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.980
...but the FL-series focuses more on the
 high end than the lows. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.670
The reason why I use this is because...

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.050
...thicker cables would actually wash out
 the low B sound on a 5 string bass. 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.310
Low B string sounds very unbalanced
 and muffled.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.560
By having a cable with a better high,
 the low B doesn't get washed out.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.250
It actually sounds more balanced.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.530
So for cables, I tend to use something thinner.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.570
My effector board is mostly Ex-Pro as well.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.150
This is also based on the FL-series.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.980
 I use cables that produce a very clear sound.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.180
