 you are greeted by the gold string project in 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.369
 the Internet is very much 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.429
 various content in the bath video 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.880
 parsing video guitar lessons and 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.130
 so on but these are all these 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 video tutorials want the best 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.629
 say and want to take over the tradition 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.440
 disassemble the original song first and 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:42.070
 then since it could have been played 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.660
 it's easier for beginners and beginners 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.649
 today we will analyze the band's song 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
 siskin and company 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.280
 about love 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.090
 but 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.240
 already 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.130
 strength 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.670
 and so on so how is the given one played 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.600
 song 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.840
 this song first let's break it down 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.510
 rhythmic pattern rhythmic pattern 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.920
 we play a very pretty principle 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.990
 just started let's just teach 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.990
 this rhythmic pattern sounds but that 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:27.410
 if to beats it will be down down down 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.340
 up through slow nice nice nice 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:40.720
 nice measures dax 2 and a year first chord in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.709
 the original we sound as the door system 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.709
 Original chord d 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.410
 then the chord goes in F sharp major 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.410
 fs 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.840
 then the chord goes h &amp; m 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.420
 and here is a small digression 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.280
 half chord is played i mean we 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:21.130
 play we clamp the body and 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:26.270
 and play miss not snow from systems and 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.330
 the next chord court is if you adored 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.020
 also from 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.020
 shave off all of that 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.810
 and so on so play and the whole 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.270
 song principle is very simple now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.790
 alternative way chords more 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.000
 easy for beginners firstly can 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.620
 play it in another key 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.860
 key 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.700
 the one of which 5 is the original, we can 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:14.040
 can we play her lead in C major 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 that is, the first chord of us will be c 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.520
 then next year will be with us and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.030
 then I 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.199
 next chord by half which 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.710
 the game is on f and g you always start 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.599
 I advise you to pinch the place f f match 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.849
 7,200 this big is important bears so he and 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.849
 looks you see it will be next 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.760
 and so on in a circle further you can 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:05.460
 play the same key with the open 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:10.620
 chords this is the key of G major then 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.760
 i.e. support edg and 1 and then chord 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.960
 goes h7 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.960
 next chord and 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:27.350
 next in half that plays color c 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.350
 and d looks like this again so 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.560
 that's the way we have in principle 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.230
 the whole song is played but you can still 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.440
 simplify 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.630
 so that you can play do not drink 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.950
 chords like here in the original 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.800
 and just play the last chord 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.580
 Well, let's look at about the same 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.300
 key gas original that is new 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.300
 advertising will be so 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:22.180
 and then we come back to 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 nerve 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:31.710
 if in other keys it will be 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.890
 nick and not 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:39.930
 and m and in the match 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:42.660
 an example is a fatality of the same purpose or 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:48.800
 in the key, the genetus is the same 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:51.280
 no longer and 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.280
 also 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.510
 we are again 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.690
 that is, with the last chord simply not 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:07.130
 play and the last but one we play entirely 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.390
 that's all sign up please 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.000

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:16.730
