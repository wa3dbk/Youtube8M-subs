00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.720
 I do not know 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.530
 why people do not come to us so beautifully and distributed over the week 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.419
 can get 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.710
 no criticism 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.509

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.880
 a criticism 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.680
 but people that's okay 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.380
 what the brothers write 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.520
 off on the edge 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 could 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Copenhagen 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.960
 do you want 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.310
 i fled here the little ones recognize a small box of critics if he does 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.270
 sit here 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.160
 the trust 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.900
 Yahoo cooperates Becker is that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.700
 but real strict you feel the application for my sake then make one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.570
 Notes or something like that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 There has been a given in the city just declared his bow down 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.440
 from the company of the arcades 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.620
 to understand the others in the restaurant 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.800

 yes with two lines out that ten Akerson could get him and his entire program 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.270
 after that is handy 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.910
 this is the same with Oberhofer who knows how it works but puling 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 and that is unfounded 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.640
 to feel 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.280
 Everyone knows it all goes very fast 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.680
 do 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.659
 and avoid liver damage, »said 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.359
 with the years 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.229
 "You can say for example Euro 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.690
 no longer the case but no photo 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.480

 Castro criticized the district's network, he said 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.990

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.540
 if you do not carve it then or not enough about it 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.990
 carving have written and yet one day so much knowledge must be available 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.240

 if no sense 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.609

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.480
 No, I've got feelings. You've already tried something where 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.739
