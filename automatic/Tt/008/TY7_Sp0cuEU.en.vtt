insights on how it was built it's
one-inch<00:00:18.349> PVC<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:21.110> it's<00:00:21.289> built<00:00:21.470> with<00:00:21.560> common

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
one-inch PVC and it's built with common

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.409 
one-inch PVC and it's built with common
parts<00:00:22.250> that<00:00:22.369> you<00:00:22.490> could<00:00:22.640> buy<00:00:22.820> from<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.210> box

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.710 
store I'll tell you quickly as we take a
look<00:00:27.380> at<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.579> the<00:00:28.730> dimensions<00:00:29.239> are<00:00:29.449> for

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
look at it what the dimensions are for

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.749 
look at it what the dimensions are for
all<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:29.989> parts<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.469> pieces<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:31.189> give<00:00:31.640> you

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
all the parts and pieces and give you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.700 
all the parts and pieces and give you
some<00:00:31.969> insights<00:00:32.360> on<00:00:32.599> how<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.170> built

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.490 

first<00:00:36.710> won't<00:00:36.920> let<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:37.190> take<00:00:37.340> a<00:00:37.399> look<00:00:37.969> at<00:00:38.210> a

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
first won't let you take a look at a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.479 
first won't let you take a look at a
little<00:00:39.500> bit<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.620> detail<00:00:40.070> here

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.979 

so<00:00:43.489> my<00:00:43.610> recommendation<00:00:43.760> when<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.600> build<00:00:44.809> this

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
so my recommendation when you build this

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.459 
so my recommendation when you build this
is<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.590> build<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.010> side<00:00:46.339> square<00:00:46.850> first

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
is that you build this side square first

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.500 
is that you build this side square first
you<00:00:48.469> build<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.890> second<00:00:49.460> side<00:00:49.670> square<00:00:50.089> first

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
you build the second side square first

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.079 
you build the second side square first
and<00:00:50.929> then<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.859> lay<00:00:52.039> these<00:00:52.219> on<00:00:52.399> their<00:00:52.579> back<00:00:52.760> and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
and then you lay these on their back and

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.660 
and then you lay these on their back and
you<00:00:53.390> build<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.780> bridge<00:00:54.019> across<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:55.219> creates

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
you build the bridge across that creates

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.509 
you build the bridge across that creates
this<00:00:55.909> cradle<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.929> if<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.890> look<00:00:58.100> at<00:00:58.219> this<00:00:58.399> this

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
this cradle and if you look at this this

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.040 
this cradle and if you look at this this
is<00:00:58.579> 1-inch<00:00:59.229> PVC<00:01:01.239> there<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.420> special<00:01:02.899> piece

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
is 1-inch PVC there is a special piece

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.040 
is 1-inch PVC there is a special piece
down<00:01:03.319> here<00:01:03.620> on<00:01:03.769> this<00:01:03.949> corner

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
down here on this corner

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.840 
down here on this corner
it's<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.229> 3-way<00:01:06.740> corner<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:07.340> typically

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's a 3-way corner you don't typically

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.980 
it's a 3-way corner you don't typically
find<00:01:08.210> those<00:01:08.420> those<00:01:08.690> are<00:01:08.720> furniture<00:01:09.440> pieces<00:01:09.710> I

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
find those those are furniture pieces I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.289 
find those those are furniture pieces I
bought<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.200> equipment<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:13.310> pieces<00:01:14.090> at

measurements and some of the insights so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600 
measurements and some of the insights so
this<00:01:37.790> piece<00:01:38.030> right<00:01:38.210> here<00:01:38.680> has<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.710> 2-inch<00:01:40.340> piece

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
this piece right here has a 2-inch piece

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.720 
this piece right here has a 2-inch piece
inside<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.280> everywhere<00:01:43.280> where<00:01:43.520> they're

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
inside and everywhere where they're

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.600 
inside and everywhere where they're
joined<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.870> can<00:01:45.080> see<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:45.560> there's<00:01:45.860> spots

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
joined you can see that there's spots

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.310 
joined you can see that there's spots
where<00:01:47.120> you'll<00:01:47.300> have<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.510> 2-inch<00:01:47.990> shim<00:01:48.290> to

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
where you'll have a 2-inch shim to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.670 
where you'll have a 2-inch shim to
connect<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.010> corners<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.640> tees<00:01:50.530> now<00:01:51.530> when

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
connect the corners to the tees now when

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.500 
connect the corners to the tees now when
I<00:01:51.710> put<00:01:51.980> this<00:01:52.100> together<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.550> made<00:01:52.850> some<00:01:53.120> mistakes

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
I put this together I made some mistakes

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.630 
I put this together I made some mistakes
so<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.050> see<00:01:54.230> how<00:01:54.380> much<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.740> gap<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.250> here

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so you can see how much of a gap is here

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.410 
so you can see how much of a gap is here
that's<00:01:56.630> really<00:01:56.960> supposed<00:01:57.230> to<00:01:57.350> be<00:01:57.470> tight<00:01:58.420> so

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that's really supposed to be tight so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.960 
that's really supposed to be tight so
for<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.720> prototype<00:02:00.230> I<00:02:00.530> learned<00:02:01.340> my<00:02:01.490> lesson<00:02:01.520> on

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
for a prototype I learned my lesson on

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.720 
for a prototype I learned my lesson on
how<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.180> do<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:03.040> if<00:02:04.040> you've<00:02:04.190> never<00:02:04.370> glued

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
how to do this and if you've never glued

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.210 
how to do this and if you've never glued
PVC<00:02:05.360> pipe<00:02:05.630> together<00:02:06.050> basically<00:02:06.380> all<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.040> do

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
PVC pipe together basically all you do

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.890 
PVC pipe together basically all you do
is<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:08.360> wash<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.200> pipe<00:02:09.440> down<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> primer

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
is you wash the pipe down with a primer

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.990 
is you wash the pipe down with a primer
for<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.989> first<00:02:12.230> part<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.680> then<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.430> glue<00:02:13.730> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
for the first part and then you glue it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.119 
for the first part and then you glue it
and<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.810> put<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:15.110> together<00:02:15.230> with<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.709> quarter

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
and you put it together with a quarter

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.390 
and you put it together with a quarter
twist<00:02:17.409> so<00:02:18.409> talking<00:02:18.800> about<00:02:18.980> some<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.220> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
twist so talking about some of the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.050 
twist so talking about some of the
dimensions<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:21.230> bar<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.010> uprights<00:02:22.490> are<00:02:22.760> 12

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
dimensions this bar the uprights are 12

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.730 
dimensions this bar the uprights are 12
inches<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.890> bar<00:02:25.100> across<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
inches and the bar across the

the bottom is 19 inches every one of the
shims<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.040> are<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.520> are<00:02:38.640> 2<00:02:39.420> inches<00:02:41.120> in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
shims that are in here are 2 inches in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.190 
shims that are in here are 2 inches in
here<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.290> where<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.590> go<00:02:43.770> together

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
here you can see where they go together

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.790 
here you can see where they go together
this<00:02:46.200> bar<00:02:46.500> right<00:02:46.800> here<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.310> 11<00:02:47.970> inches<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.800> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
this bar right here is 11 inches and I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.280 
this bar right here is 11 inches and I
thought<00:02:50.010> about<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.520> debate<00:02:51.050> 12:12

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
thought about the debate 12:12

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.470 
thought about the debate 12:12
why<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.800> 11<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> really<00:02:53.760> didn't<00:02:54.270> want

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
why go 11 here but I really didn't want

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.120 
why go 11 here but I really didn't want
to<00:02:54.540> make<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.750> any<00:02:54.990> wider<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.710> hive<00:02:55.920> stand

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
to make it any wider for the hive stand

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
to make it any wider for the hive stand
that<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.550> had<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:57.600> could<00:02:57.750> certainly<00:02:57.990> make<00:02:58.230> this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
that I had you could certainly make this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.860 
that I had you could certainly make this
bar<00:02:58.830> 12<00:02:59.190> inches<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.760> not<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> problem

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
bar 12 inches and not have a problem

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.230 
bar 12 inches and not have a problem
with<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.590> then<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.550> could<00:03:02.790> standardize

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
with that and then you could standardize

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.980 
with that and then you could standardize
some<00:03:03.450> dimensions<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:05.280> 12<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.120> 19<00:03:06.660> inches

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
some dimensions to just 12 and 19 inches

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.710 
some dimensions to just 12 and 19 inches
for<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.230> majority<00:03:07.740> of<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.390> then<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> one

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
for the majority of it and then the one

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.770 
for the majority of it and then the one
final<00:03:10.260> piece<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.520> upright<00:03:12.240> bar<00:03:12.510> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
final piece is this upright bar that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
final piece is this upright bar that
provides<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.500> most<00:03:13.530> support<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.580> nine

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
provides the most support this is a nine

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.910 
provides the most support this is a nine
inch<00:03:15.240> piece<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:17.270> everything<00:03:18.270> else<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.920> pretty

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
inch piece and everything else is pretty

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.180 
inch piece and everything else is pretty
much<00:03:20.040> standard

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.490 

show<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.580> bit<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.880> detail<00:03:30.500> and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
show you a little bit of the detail and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.290 
show you a little bit of the detail and
it's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.800> little<00:03:31.920> dirty<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.370> actually<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:33.090> went

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
it's a little dirty I actually just went

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.720 
it's a little dirty I actually just went
out<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.480> pulled<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.020> off<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.470> ground<00:03:34.730> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
out and pulled it off of the ground and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.400 
out and pulled it off of the ground and
brought<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.330> in<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> house<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.050> can<00:03:37.260> take

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
brought it in the house so you can take

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.190 
brought it in the house so you can take
a<00:03:37.440> look<00:03:37.650> at<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:39.709> when<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.860> look<00:03:41.069> at<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
a look at it when you look at the the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.350 
a look at it when you look at the the
cradle<00:03:43.709> part<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.190> built<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:45.239> it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
cradle part I built this so that it

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.100 
cradle part I built this so that it
would<00:03:45.480> sit<00:03:45.690> down<00:03:45.930> inside<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.650> stand<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:48.110> it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
would sit down inside the stand and it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.270 
would sit down inside the stand and it
would<00:03:49.230> carry<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.650> weight<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.830> little<00:03:50.160> bit

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
would carry the weight a little bit

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.390 
would carry the weight a little bit
better<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.650> some<00:03:52.650> people<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.040> asked<00:03:53.340> me

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
better and some people have asked me

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.130 
better and some people have asked me
whether<00:03:53.700> or<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.269> need<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.480> secure<00:03:54.959> this

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
whether or not you need to secure this

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.290 
whether or not you need to secure this
to<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.410> ground<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.730> could<00:03:56.910> potentially

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
to the ground you could potentially

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.930 
to the ground you could potentially
secure<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.110> ground<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:59.340> by<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.550> j-hook

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
secure it to the ground just by a j-hook

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.080 
secure it to the ground just by a j-hook
and<00:04:00.480> put<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:00.930> down<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.090> just

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and put it right down in here and just

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
and put it right down in here and just
clamp<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.600> down<00:04:03.630> over<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.260> 1-inch<00:04:04.620> piece<00:04:09.110> and

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
clamp it down over the 1-inch piece and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.670 
clamp it down over the 1-inch piece and
that's<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:11.430> too<00:04:11.640> complicated<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
that's it not too complicated and the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.539 
that's it not too complicated and the
entire<00:04:14.040> bill<00:04:14.400> for<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:14.790> thing<00:04:15.229> was<00:04:16.229> $25<00:04:17.220> for

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
entire bill for this thing was $25 for

building<00:04:38.310> them<00:04:38.550> one<00:04:39.450> last<00:04:39.479> thing<00:04:39.930> about<00:04:40.200> it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
building them one last thing about it

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.120 
building them one last thing about it
this<00:04:40.530> one<00:04:40.740> particularly<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.880> just<00:04:42.270> white<00:04:42.510> I

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
this one particularly is just white I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570 
this one particularly is just white I
built<00:04:44.130> some<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.460> these<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:44.850> painted<00:04:46.580> the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
built some of these that I painted the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.010 
built some of these that I painted the
way<00:04:47.729> you<00:04:47.789> would<00:04:48.030> do<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.300> is<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.510> would<00:04:48.630> wipe<00:04:48.840> it

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
way you would do it is you would wipe it

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.770 
way you would do it is you would wipe it
down<00:04:49.140> with<00:04:49.200> acetone<00:04:50.010> or<00:04:50.310> some<00:04:51.210> sort<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.539> paint

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
down with acetone or some sort of paint

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.190 
down with acetone or some sort of paint
thinner<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.640> glue<00:04:53.970> from<00:04:54.600> something

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
thinner this is a glue from something

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.600 
thinner this is a glue from something
that<00:04:55.229> happened<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.010> would<00:04:56.100> take<00:04:56.280> all<00:04:56.460> this

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that happened and it would take all this

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.420 
that happened and it would take all this
lettering<00:04:56.940> off<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.620> would<00:04:58.710> prime<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.220> for

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
lettering off and it would prime it for

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.210 
lettering off and it would prime it for
the<00:04:59.520> point<00:04:59.760> you<00:05:00.030> would<00:05:00.180> use<00:05:01.220> krylon

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
the point you would use krylon

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.270 
the point you would use krylon
ColdFusion<00:05:03.180> paint<00:05:03.479> or<00:05:04.110> fusion<00:05:04.590> paint<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:05.070> think

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
ColdFusion paint or fusion paint I think

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.400 
ColdFusion paint or fusion paint I think
that's<00:05:05.430> what<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:05.700> called<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.110> paint

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
that's what it's called it's the paint

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.350 
that's what it's called it's the paint
for<00:05:07.620> plastic<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.729> can<00:05:08.940> paint<00:05:09.240> it

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
for plastic and you can paint it

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.010 
for plastic and you can paint it
whatever<00:05:09.720> color<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.260> want<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.450> town<00:05:12.660> yard

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
I painted mine far screen so they look a

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.909 
I painted mine far screen so they look a
little<00:05:17.039> nicer<00:05:17.520> than<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:18.060> know<00:05:18.210> white<00:05:18.919> PVC

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
little nicer than you know white PVC

weather and the Sun is eventually this
