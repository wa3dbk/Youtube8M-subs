accurately and powerful so I came up

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.519 
accurately and powerful so I came up

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
tilde 2.0 let me show you its features

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.900 
tilde 2.0 let me show you its features
it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> folding<00:00:31.170> stock<00:00:31.430> which<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> actually

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it has a folding stock which is actually

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.840 
it has a folding stock which is actually
held<00:00:33.120> back<00:00:33.390> by<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.750> magnets<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
held back by two magnets here and it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
held back by two magnets here and it
also<00:00:36.030> has<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> red<00:00:36.660> dot<00:00:36.840> sight<00:00:38.540> it<00:00:39.540> has<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.140> very

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
also has a red dot sight it has a very

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.340 
also has a red dot sight it has a very
nice<00:00:40.590> barrel<00:00:41.100> system<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.360> dart<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.840> guided

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
nice barrel system the dart is guided

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
nice barrel system the dart is guided
inside<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> barrel<00:00:44.250> cocking<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> very

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
inside of the barrel cocking is very

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.869 
inside of the barrel cocking is very
very<00:00:45.660> easy<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.250> rubber<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.700> weak

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
very easy because rubber is really weak

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
very easy because rubber is really weak
the<00:00:48.809> darts<00:00:49.350> wouldn't<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.920> stand<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the darts wouldn't really stand a lot of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.750 
the darts wouldn't really stand a lot of
draw<00:00:50.820> weights<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> then<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.190> fit<00:00:53.489> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
draw weights so and then if you fit in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.130 
draw weights so and then if you fit in
the<00:00:53.910> dart<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the dart you can see that it is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.619 
the dart you can see that it is
absolutely<00:00:59.100> straight<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> canal<00:01:01.859> it

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
absolutely straight in the canal it

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.600 
absolutely straight in the canal it
shows<00:01:03.629> quite<00:01:03.840> nicely<00:01:07.040> let's<00:01:08.040> compare<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
shows quite nicely let's compare the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
shows quite nicely let's compare the
power<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.900> throwing<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.470> dart<00:01:10.650> at

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
power first so I'm throwing a dart at

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
power first so I'm throwing a dart at
this<00:01:11.220> dark<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:14.330> okay<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.960> shooting

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this dark one okay and now I'm shooting

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
this dark one okay and now I'm shooting
one<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:18.320> quite<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> difference<00:01:19.799> when<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
one at it quite a difference when you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.780 
one at it quite a difference when you
say<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.530> allows<00:01:22.920> me<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> shoot<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
say this allows me to shoot from a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.160 
say this allows me to shoot from a
longer<00:01:23.970> distance<00:01:25.610> from<00:01:26.610> 10<00:01:26.850> meters<00:01:27.170> windage

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
longer distance from 10 meters windage

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
longer distance from 10 meters windage
and<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> problem

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and so on is a little bit of a problem

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
and so on is a little bit of a problem
because<00:01:30.000> these<00:01:30.390> aren't<00:01:30.689> high-end<00:01:31.110> darts

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because these aren't high-end darts

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
because these aren't high-end darts
now<00:01:32.130> let's<00:01:32.400> shoot<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.759> 3<00:01:33.000> meters<00:01:33.150> distance

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
now let's shoot from 3 meters distance

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.719 
now let's shoot from 3 meters distance
which<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> typical<00:01:34.890> distance<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.520> dart

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
which is the typical distance for dart

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.999 
which is the typical distance for dart
competition<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:42.320> think<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> had<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> couple<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
competition I think I had a couple of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.870 
competition I think I had a couple of
Robin<00:01:44.399> Hood<00:01:44.549> hits<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> slingshot

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
Robin Hood hits this is the slingshot

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.539 
Robin Hood hits this is the slingshot
channel<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.810> must<00:01:52.049> take<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.710> things<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
channel so we must take all things to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.030 
channel so we must take all things to
the<00:01:53.670> extreme<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.780> why<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.079> put<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.439> four

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the extreme that's why we put on four

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.090 
the extreme that's why we put on four
times<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.670> amount<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.969> rubber<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.100> we

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
times the amount of rubber now and we

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.850 
times the amount of rubber now and we
also<00:01:59.310> had<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> use<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.719> thick<00:02:01.290> string

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
also had to use a very very thick string

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.330 
also had to use a very very thick string
now<00:02:02.659> otherwise<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.170> immediately<00:02:04.530> smash

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
now otherwise it would immediately smash

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:26.440 
now otherwise it would immediately smash
the<00:02:05.939> backside<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.750> darts

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 

did<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.140> see<00:02:27.349> how<00:02:27.500> deep<00:02:27.709> he<00:02:27.860> had<00:02:28.010> penetrated

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
did you see how deep he had penetrated

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.640 
did you see how deep he had penetrated
and<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.390> even<00:02:29.630> shifted<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> part<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
and it even shifted the part of the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.990 
and it even shifted the part of the
eight<00:02:30.800> back<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:33.770> didn't<00:02:34.099> stick<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.700> see

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
eight back it didn't stick but you see

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.229 
eight back it didn't stick but you see
poked<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.569> hole<00:02:35.720> right<00:02:36.050> through<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:37.720> steel<00:02:40.239> no

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
poked a hole right through the steel no

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.500 
poked a hole right through the steel no
bad<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.290> that's<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.190> today<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:46.239> hope<00:02:47.239> you
