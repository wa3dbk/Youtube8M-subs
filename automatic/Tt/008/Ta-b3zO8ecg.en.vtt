00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
numbers but what we were looking at when

numbers but what we were looking at when
we<00:00:45.450> looked<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.899> drive<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> faster

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
we looked at this drive is it's faster

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
we looked at this drive is it's faster
but<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.570> new<00:00:48.719> markets<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> enable<00:00:49.739> what

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
but what new markets does it enable what

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
but what new markets does it enable what
does<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> enable<00:00:50.579> us<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> flash

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
does it enable us to do with the flash

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
does it enable us to do with the flash
drive<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.440> couldn't<00:00:52.770> do<00:00:52.890> before<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
drive that we couldn't do before and the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
drive that we couldn't do before and the
answer<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.809> well<00:00:55.430> nothing<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.640> goes<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
answer was well nothing it just goes a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790 
answer was well nothing it just goes a
lot<00:00:57.360> faster<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> lot<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> people

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
lot faster and for a lot of people

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
lot faster and for a lot of people
that's<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.430> after<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's all they're after but there are a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.600 
that's all they're after but there are a
lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.110> folks<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:01.949> looking<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.579> more

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
lot of folks that are looking to do more

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.579 
lot of folks that are looking to do more
with<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> flash<00:01:03.390> drive<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.989> make<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> more

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
with the flash drive to make this more

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840 
of a hard drive replacement and in order
to<00:01:06.899> get<00:01:07.139> there<00:01:07.529> we<00:01:07.950> need<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.249> really<00:01:08.490> needed<00:01:08.819> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to get there we need to really needed to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
to get there we need to really needed to
elevate<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> smaller<00:01:10.049> block<00:01:10.439> performance

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
elevate the smaller block performance

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.830 
elevate the smaller block performance
like<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> number<00:01:11.789> we're<00:01:11.939> about<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.359> see<00:01:12.509> here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
