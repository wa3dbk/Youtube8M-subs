00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 That's when I saw my name there. 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.980
 I did not have a radio here 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.319
 Then I started sending messages to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.030
 first friends and so do not show you 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.910
 that I passed I went to search my 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.410
 That's when the chip fell and you knew it. 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 that my father was like this, I think I passed 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.390
 to him were passed passed 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.869
 there I went I went into performance was 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:31.769
 in my post that yes I went there 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 I started shouting at the 3rd year of the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.960
 high school 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.610
 I started researching which ones to put them 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 best placed on the pines in the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 unicamp and in the unifesp and always appeared 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 spoon of the type I spoke at the time of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.629
 know very well to be here 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
 Then I started to look at the hours and that 's the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.309
 amount of simulated cycles and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 interest and frei I think this is what 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 That's the same as teaching teachers. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.690
 are very dynamic you learn 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 You laugh at the same time and kind people. 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.600
 able to maintain is the very kind room 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.479
 discipline there is no parallel conversation throughout 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 world I need attention then what else is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.290
 helped me figure out which of my 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 deficiencies is what I needed 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.479
 study more and helped me organize my 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.509
 Dad says everything with the right time 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.880
 I'm also in the question is of the classes until 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.130
 that I went on the agenda and looked at it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 which I had until that day I could 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 organize enough from this 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.790
 application to believe in me knows son 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 I've done something harder than that so 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 This is football and I can think of it too. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 that the first teachers are the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.899
 coordination type the discipline of 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 coma of how things are organized is 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.380
 simulations are also essential 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 We're going to trouble ourselves on time for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.219
 proof how much time you spend writing such 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 I think this is quite a point 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.430
 relevant at the time of the people indicates this 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.150
 for a person think the tip 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.060
 essential if I give 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.600
 is to keep as much time as possible 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.060
 Class in the head, you know, I always stayed. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.220
 remembering is mentally given that the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.370
 process had spoken before bed 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 type has to be focused know is all 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.940
 time you have to try to remember 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.400
 Just do not keep the notebook and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.350
 stay reading just because it's just not going 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.270
 like nothing later does not mean that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 You're learning what's on your mind.
