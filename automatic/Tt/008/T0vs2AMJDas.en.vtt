00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.840 

in<00:00:05.649> this<00:00:05.890> video<00:00:06.220> we're<00:00:06.460> going<00:00:06.550> to<00:00:06.640> talk<00:00:06.819> about

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.449 
in this video we're going to talk about
left-turning<00:00:07.600> tendencies<00:00:07.689> of<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.410> aircraft

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:11.459 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.549 

the<00:00:12.459> four<00:00:12.760> left-turning<00:00:13.360> tendencies<00:00:13.449> as<00:00:14.110> we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
the four left-turning tendencies as we

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.120 
the four left-turning tendencies as we
see<00:00:14.680> here<00:00:14.889> are<00:00:15.420> torque<00:00:17.130> gyroscopic

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
see here are torque gyroscopic

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.050 
see here are torque gyroscopic
precession<00:00:19.350> P<00:00:20.350> factor<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.640> spiraling

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
precession P factor and the spiraling

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.850 
precession P factor and the spiraling
slipstream

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.230 

alright<00:00:26.860> this<00:00:27.220> first<00:00:27.490> little<00:00:27.850> picture<00:00:28.210> here

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
alright this first little picture here

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.220 
alright this first little picture here
shows<00:00:28.630> torque

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
shows torque

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.410 
shows torque
well<00:00:29.770> what<00:00:29.920> torque<00:00:30.190> is<00:00:30.369> is<00:00:30.550> for<00:00:30.910> every<00:00:31.210> action

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
well what torque is is for every action

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.600 
well what torque is is for every action
there<00:00:31.869> is<00:00:31.900> an<00:00:32.079> equal<00:00:32.199> but<00:00:32.559> opposite<00:00:33.010> reaction

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
there is an equal but opposite reaction

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.970 
there is an equal but opposite reaction
and<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.069> propeller<00:00:36.429> spinning<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.800> a

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
and with the propeller spinning in a

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.160 
and with the propeller spinning in a
clockwise<00:00:39.550> when<00:00:40.120> viewed<00:00:40.420> from<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.719> cockpit

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
clockwise when viewed from the cockpit

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
clockwise when viewed from the cockpit
in<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.620> clockwise<00:00:42.390> rotational<00:00:43.390> manner<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in a clockwise rotational manner the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.049 
in a clockwise rotational manner the
airframe<00:00:46.719> wants<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.859> turn<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.579> opposite

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
airframe wants to turn the opposite

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.209 
airframe wants to turn the opposite
direction<00:00:49.239> that's<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.379> effect<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.800> torque<00:00:51.069> on

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
direction that's the effect of torque on

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.430 
direction that's the effect of torque on
the<00:00:51.489> aircraft<00:00:51.879> that<00:00:52.479> provides<00:00:52.929> one<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.229> the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
the aircraft that provides one of the

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.489 
the aircraft that provides one of the
left-turning<00:00:53.920> tendencies

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
left-turning tendencies

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.739 
left-turning tendencies
the<00:00:56.499> other<00:00:56.679> is<00:00:59.010> gyroscopic<00:01:00.010> precession<00:01:00.749> now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
the other is gyroscopic precession now

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:10.950 
the other is gyroscopic precession now
if<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:02.019> had<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:03.180> disk<00:01:04.180> spinning<00:01:04.870> and<00:01:07.079> you<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.930> a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
if you had a disk spinning and you put a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.160 
if you had a disk spinning and you put a
force<00:01:11.259> up<00:01:11.469> at<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.649> top<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.219> it<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.869> this

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
force up at the top of it just like this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.050 
force up at the top of it just like this
propeller<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.799> spinning<00:01:14.829> and<00:01:15.310> we<00:01:15.520> put<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.759> force

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
propeller is spinning and we put a force

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.380 
propeller is spinning and we put a force
at<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.329> top<00:01:16.539> that<00:01:17.530> force<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.159> felt<00:01:18.460> 90<00:01:19.060> degrees

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
at the top that force is felt 90 degrees

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.050 
at the top that force is felt 90 degrees
in<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.930> direction<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.890> rotation<00:01:21.039> so<00:01:21.909> we

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
in the direction of the rotation so we

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.289 
in the direction of the rotation so we
push<00:01:22.299> at<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.509> top<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:23.619> dealt<00:01:24.490> 90

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
push at the top and it's dealt 90

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.660 
push at the top and it's dealt 90
degrees<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:26.109> the<00:01:26.740> direction<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.310> if<00:01:27.430> you<00:01:27.520> took

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
degrees in the direction so if you took

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.399 
degrees in the direction so if you took
like<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:27.820> bicycle<00:01:28.359> tire<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.780> spun<00:01:29.109> it<00:01:29.140> and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
like a bicycle tire and you spun it and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.620 
like a bicycle tire and you spun it and
then<00:01:29.829> you<00:01:29.950> went<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.189> turn<00:01:30.369> it<00:01:30.399> you'd<00:01:30.909> feel<00:01:31.299> kind

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
then you went to turn it you'd feel kind

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.130 
then you went to turn it you'd feel kind
of<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.810> weird<00:01:33.030> motion<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.210> your<00:01:34.960> hands<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.329> that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
of a weird motion on your hands and that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.609 
of a weird motion on your hands and that
is<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.530> gyroscopic<00:01:38.799> precession<00:01:40.619> gyroscopic

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
is the gyroscopic precession gyroscopic

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.529 
is the gyroscopic precession gyroscopic
precession<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:42.280> also<00:01:42.609> in<00:01:42.820> our<00:01:42.909> gyro

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
precession is also in our gyro

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.219 
precession is also in our gyro
instruments<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.439> aircraft<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:46.229> that's

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
instruments in the aircraft and that's

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.099 
instruments in the aircraft and that's
why<00:01:47.469> they<00:01:47.619> preach<00:01:47.890> they<00:01:48.249> precess<00:01:48.869> due<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.990> all

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
why they preach they precess due to all

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.749 
why they preach they precess due to all
the<00:01:50.229> different<00:01:50.530> forces<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.189> so<00:01:51.460> we<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:51.670> to

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
the different forces and so we have to

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.719 
the different forces and so we have to
always<00:01:51.969> be<00:01:52.119> check<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.659> those<00:01:53.369> such<00:01:54.369> as<00:01:54.399> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
always be check in those such as the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.920 
always be check in those such as the
heading<00:01:54.969> indicator

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
heading indicator

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.420 
heading indicator
now<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:59.210> is<00:01:59.450> probably<00:02:00.260> most<00:02:02.740> predominant<00:02:03.740> in

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
now this is probably most predominant in

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.600 
now this is probably most predominant in
a<00:02:04.880> tailwheel<00:02:05.420> aircraft<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:07.040> when<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.370> are

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
a tailwheel aircraft so when you are

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.850 
a tailwheel aircraft so when you are
rolling<00:02:08.600> down<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.930> runway<00:02:09.050> with<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.619> three

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
rolling down the runway with all three

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.780 
rolling down the runway with all three
wheels<00:02:10.070> on<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.550> ground

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.920 

everything's<00:02:13.790> you're<00:02:14.360> still<00:02:14.630> getting<00:02:14.810> some

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
everything's you're still getting some

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.210 
everything's you're still getting some
left-turning<00:02:15.320> tendencies<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
left-turning tendencies but then the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.040 
left-turning tendencies but then the
gyroscopic<00:02:16.730> precession<00:02:16.910> kicks<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:17.960> you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
gyroscopic precession kicks in when you

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.230 
gyroscopic precession kicks in when you
raise<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.470> tail<00:02:18.680> up<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.130> you're<00:02:19.760> forcing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
raise that tail up and you're forcing

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.980 
raise that tail up and you're forcing
that<00:02:20.510> prop<00:02:21.460> forward<00:02:22.600> you're<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:23.960> a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
that prop forward you're going to get a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.440 
that prop forward you're going to get a
lot<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.710> left-turning<00:02:25.460> tendencies<00:02:25.550> there<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
lot of left-turning tendencies there so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.080 
lot of left-turning tendencies there so
if<00:02:26.870> you're<00:02:27.050> getting<00:02:27.650> your<00:02:27.830> tail<00:02:28.100> wheel<00:02:28.310> rating

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
if you're getting your tail wheel rating

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.440 
if you're getting your tail wheel rating
or<00:02:29.270> endorsement<00:02:30.459> one<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> big<00:02:32.180> things

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
or endorsement one of the big things

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.380 
or endorsement one of the big things
that<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.959> figure<00:02:33.800> out<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.280> how<00:02:34.670> much

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
that you have to figure out is how much

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.790 
that you have to figure out is how much
rudder<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.840> use<00:02:35.990> when<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.290> bring<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.590> tail

it<00:02:51.950> slips<00:02:52.340> around<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.790> hits<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.420> tail

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it slips around and it hits the tail

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.449 
it slips around and it hits the tail
causing<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.680> yaw<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.459> left<00:02:55.670> direction<00:02:57.459> nose

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
causing a yaw in the left direction nose

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.880 
causing a yaw in the left direction nose
left<00:02:58.730> direction<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.050> hits<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.380> left<00:03:00.620> side

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
left direction so it hits the left side

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
it's much more pronounced when you're

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.810 
it's much more pronounced when you're
taking<00:03:40.549> off<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:42.049> have<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.820> that

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
side of the prop so you get a little bit
