my<00:02:15.160> only<00:02:15.340> issues<00:02:15.790> were<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.569> bit<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
my only issues were the little bit of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.960 
my only issues were the little bit of
transfer<00:02:17.440> but<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.130> majority<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.640> my<00:02:18.790> issue

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
transfer but the majority of my issue

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.600 
transfer but the majority of my issue
was<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.390> clumpiness<00:02:19.900> how<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:21.340> so

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
was the clumpiness how it just it's so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
was the clumpiness how it just it's so
wet<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.090> gets<00:02:22.120> those<00:02:22.480> little<00:02:22.720> clumps<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.230> on

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
wet it gets those little clumps all on

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.990 
wet it gets those little clumps all on
your<00:02:23.680> lashes<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.489> brush

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
your lashes and on the brush

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.210 
your lashes and on the brush
I<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.690> tried<00:02:25.900> wiping<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.440> brush<00:02:26.620> off<00:02:26.830> first

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
I have tried wiping the brush off first

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.890 
I have tried wiping the brush off first
that<00:02:27.730> worked<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> little<00:02:28.209> bit<00:02:28.390> better<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.780> then

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that worked a little bit better but then

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.540 
that worked a little bit better but then
I<00:02:28.930> needed<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.230> second<00:02:29.650> coat<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.069> then<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> kind

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
I needed a second coat and then I kind

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.070 
I needed a second coat and then I kind
of<00:02:30.610> got<00:02:30.730> clumpy<00:02:31.209> when<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.480> started<00:02:31.810> doing<00:02:31.900> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
of got clumpy when you started doing a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.710 
of got clumpy when you started doing a
second<00:02:32.500> coat<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.390> hard<00:02:34.569> because

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
second coat so it's kind of hard because

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.240 
second coat so it's kind of hard because
I<00:02:34.840> love<00:02:34.930> things<00:02:35.500> about<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.099> also

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
I love things about this but I also

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.710 
I love things about this but I also
really<00:02:36.640> disliked<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> couple<00:02:37.390> things<00:02:37.569> about

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
really disliked a couple things about

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.479 
really disliked a couple things about
this<00:02:37.989> too<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.590> really<00:02:38.800> kind<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.280> hard

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
this too so it's really kind of a hard

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.580 
this too so it's really kind of a hard
take<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.870> say<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.349> way<00:02:41.560> or

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
take on this one to say one way or

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.920 
take on this one to say one way or
another<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.790> depends<00:02:43.360> on<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.720> you're

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
another it depends on what you're

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.070 
another it depends on what you're
looking<00:02:44.080> for<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.269> wet<00:02:46.600> formula

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
looking for if you like a wet formula

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.360 
looking for if you like a wet formula

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.660 
this is definitely going to be for you
if<00:02:48.610> you're<00:02:48.790> used<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.239> working<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:50.670> things

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
if you're used to working with things

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.949 
if you're used to working with things
like<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:53.049> like<00:02:53.319> this<00:02:53.530> style<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.310> brush

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
like that I do like this style of brush

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.660 
like that I do like this style of brush
traditionally<00:02:55.959> but<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.920> way<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.190> one<00:02:57.400> sits

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
traditionally but the way this one sits

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.009 
traditionally but the way this one sits
with<00:02:57.849> clumps<00:02:58.180> on<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> edge<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:58.780> my

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
with clumps on the edge that's my

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.589 
with clumps on the edge that's my
biggest<00:02:59.470> issue<00:02:59.769> with<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.269> product

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
biggest issue with it so the product

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.420 
biggest issue with it so the product
overall<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.200> nice<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.069> middle<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
overall is nice it's a middle of the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.990 
overall is nice it's a middle of the
road<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.819> three<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.019> packaging

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
road it's three I do like the packaging

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.570 
road it's three I do like the packaging
pigmentation<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:07.209> very<00:03:07.599> very<00:03:07.930> very<00:03:08.200> black

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
pigmentation it's very very very black

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.030 
pigmentation it's very very very black
so<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.790> good<00:03:10.000> solid<00:03:10.209> four<00:03:10.630> out<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.900> five

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
so it's a good solid four out of five

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.670 
so it's a good solid four out of five
texture<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.480> nice<00:03:13.720> texture<00:03:14.170> except<00:03:14.470> for

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
texture it's a nice texture except for

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.870 
texture it's a nice texture except for
the<00:03:14.739> clumps<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.310> only<00:03:15.400> gonna<00:03:15.579> give<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.720 
the clumps so I'm only gonna give it a
three<00:03:15.910> there<00:03:16.470> longevity<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.620> did<00:03:17.829> lot<00:03:18.100> last

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
three there longevity it did lot last

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.819 
three there longevity it did lot last
really<00:03:19.180> well<00:03:19.359> it<00:03:19.630> held<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.900> curl<00:03:20.260> well<00:03:20.530> it

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
really well it held the curl well it

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.039 
really well it held the curl well it
stayed<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.250> nicely<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.510> said<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.810> didn't

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
stayed on nicely as I said it didn't

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.590 
stayed on nicely as I said it didn't
flake<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.430> I'm<00:03:24.519> only<00:03:24.670> gonna<00:03:24.880> give<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.299> four

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the top a little bit but that's also

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.680 
the top a little bit but that's also

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
for a little bit less so it's kind of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.120 
for a little bit less so it's kind of
that<00:04:07.329> medium<00:04:07.750> brand<00:04:07.989> between<00:04:08.410> like<00:04:08.650> drugstore
