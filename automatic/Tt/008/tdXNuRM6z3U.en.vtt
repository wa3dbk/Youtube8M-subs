00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Carlos, if you can know, I would like 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.879
 know any that has been sent caruso 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.879
 that can be told 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.030
 for me 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.420
 he clarified many things because yes 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.420
 low 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.620
 and what 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.080
 smart and knows all colors 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.080
 Argentines 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.890
 what is the truth what he said yesterday 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 technical thanks surely for old women 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.449

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.449
 of tinelli how close you were 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.350
 yes and how about 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.839
 put the weights 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.110
 they look like throne 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 and nod 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:16.119
 but it may be that once he put so much 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.119
 silver and the coach sang another figure 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.400
 he stayed with the return 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.520
