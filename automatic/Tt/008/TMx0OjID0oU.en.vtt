hello and today today on Sunday science

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.030 
hello and today today on Sunday science
we're<00:00:08.879> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.270> be<00:00:09.389> creating<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.379> cyclone

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we're going to be creating a cyclone

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.560 
we're going to be creating a cyclone
wasn't<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:11.879> cycle<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:13.099> cyclone<00:00:14.099> comes<00:00:15.030> from<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
wasn't a cycle a cyclone comes from the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
wasn't a cycle a cyclone comes from the
Greek<00:00:15.809> word<00:00:16.220> to<00:00:17.220> spin<00:00:17.640> around<00:00:18.380> it<00:00:19.380> also<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Greek word to spin around it also is

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.830 
Greek word to spin around it also is
made<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.869> high<00:00:22.320> low<00:00:22.859> pressure<00:00:23.279> areas<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
made up of high low pressure areas and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.580 
made up of high low pressure areas and
today<00:00:26.269> we<00:00:27.269> won't<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:28.140> creating<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:30.140> first<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
today we won't be creating one first you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
today we won't be creating one first you
will<00:00:32.189> need<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:33.680> trifold<00:00:34.680> display<00:00:42.260> duct<00:00:43.260> tape

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
will need a trifold display duct tape

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.579 
will need a trifold display duct tape

parents permission before you do this so

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.390 
parents permission before you do this so
first<00:00:59.940> you'll<00:01:00.629> need<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.260> cut<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.830> trifold

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
first you'll need to cut the trifold

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.840 
first you'll need to cut the trifold
display<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.129> need<00:01:05.519> cuts

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
display and will also need cuts

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
display and will also need cuts
