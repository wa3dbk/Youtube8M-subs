00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 today in sing digital point tv filmations 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.840
 aerial with remote control helicopter 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.039
 hello how are you like jose luis through 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.920
 of thin digital tv and this time 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.500
 we are with enrique rubio de mírame 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.750
 fly without wings what he does is something 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.369
 very interesting many people surely 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.039
 has seen the aerial shots with 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.140
 helicopters to remote control and up 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.939
 where we know nobody in Mexico 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.960
 I had a helicopter with the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.489
 characteristics that enrique has 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.680
 hello enrique can explain us a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.350
 little bit more about your helicopter 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.120
 clear clear look at you I explain this is a 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.030
 auto cop ternos we are talking about eight 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.010
 arms is electric four turn towards 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720
 one side rotates towards the other to 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.210
 compensate the movement and float 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.040
 really this device helps us a lot 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660
 that fleet does not need a transition 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.540
 like a helicopter like the ones that already 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.489
 we have that in this is a transition and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.110
 a detained moment is when you take 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.079
 starts to be good here since I 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.220
 elevas starts to be good is electric 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.400
 has advantages like 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.460
 you do not have to be but with gas 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.800
 and transport it many kindnesses that 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 they have is not stabilized directly by 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 medium of the computer then what 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 is the useful if you move it the roll 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.050
 you move the same because it turns on its 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.780
 own axis and panning is compensated for by 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.540
 machine 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.180
 ok and kind of what kind of cameras 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.250
 you can fly with this team with this 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.940
 We will set you up on the 5th of March 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.520
 2 with a good 24 lens we assemble you 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.290
 20 405 but it may be a 24 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.270
 or 24 50 I can ride the lake but and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.140
 good and today we could do the tests 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.260
 with faith 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.060
 with the h 2 sorry and well there what we 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.890
 help is the flight time not really 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.710
 the weight is what determines the time of 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.400
 flight with each pile more or less how much 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 average time you can fly with with the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.479
 camera because it is also very important 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.300
 let people know that you can not lift 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.800
 the helicopter and have it flying 5 hours 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.200
 has a time limit due to 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.660
 issues of battery weight and so on 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.340
 this equipment now flies with batteries of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.650
 6000 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 six thousand two hundred milliamperes of 14 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.810
 volts and with the weight of five of you 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.019
 gives an approximate of five minutes with the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.349
 lumix with the panasonic I downloaded it from h2 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.560
 we're talking we think about 86 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.080
 minutes and good with lake pro 15 20 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.430
 minutes this good depends on the height 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.390
 also a little and the conditions of 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.910
 ok air and there are also people there are people 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 who doubts about the stability of 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.629
 teams especially if you start making a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.760
 little bit of air and so on because they say ok 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.430
 if he can fly but if he does a little 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.620
 of air no longer does not work no and of course 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.329
 here the goodness of this team is that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.030
 it's managed has three flight modes 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.250
 which is totally manual that you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.959
 you control perfectly altitude that is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.420
 let him stay still 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.700
 in altitude like how are you not saying and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.340
 the other is by GPS gps is there you stay 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.709
 I loose control and there you can stay 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.360
 and you call is the useful panel with your 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.440
 camera with the video tablet can be 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.310
 be watching what the camera is 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.989
 recording 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.250
 ok and more or less good we know we know 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.630
 that you have already worked with many 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.860
 companies in which parts of the country do you work 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.150
 with this equipment we have the kindness of 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.610
 be able to work anywhere in the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.769
 republic because the logistics is a lot 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.739
 lower the raise to a suitcase of one meter 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.540
 for one sixty meters you get on the plane 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.670
 you arrive this fly and you can pray the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.730
 same day not really here we have 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.190
 worked from mexicalli cancún in the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.440
 road course and good where they tell us there 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.890
 we arrived 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.800
 ok and good we have spoken in many 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.980
 occasions to give value to production 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.750
 to give that differentiator to our 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.790
 production and obviously doing 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.220
 you take aerial shots with helicopter is 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.830
 something that many customers ask but that 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.930
 They do not really know how much it costs to bring 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.790
 a helicopter to ride for a 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.710
 helicopter with a tyler saddle 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.570
 restrictions that there is in that the 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.250
 helicopter can not go down to two 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.320
 meters but the helicopter to be 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.540
 at a certain height what advantages 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.220
 offers to fly with remote control instead 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.350
 to bring a helicopter both in cost 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.870
 as in good functionality in cost the 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.150
 you can meet with real helicopter 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.060
 from 18 thousand pesos more 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.670
 good in total you put that 25 the average 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.080
 hour the hour depends how you pack 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.610
 but it has the limitations as you say 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.110
 what do you have a shooting angle does not 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.270
 you can go down because aeronautics 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.610
 allows you to raise dust and that's not the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.830
 advantage of this is that it can rise 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.830
 meter two meters 50 meters 100 meters 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.140
 with the gps 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.150
 pass it over people of people 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.010
 sorry because good after all is 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.920
 electric and have not given case is 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.140
 have to go down do not hurt anyone like 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.440
 a real helicopter or like the others of 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.510
 gasoline we have not also ok and more 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.890
 or less many people surely will 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.930
 will be asking good 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.150
 how much does it cost to work with 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.980
 one of these things because surely 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.780
 There will be people interested in the 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.270
 your clients' projects for weddings 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.410
 so very spectacular weddings them 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.140
 It can work if we have 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.140
 basically not in weddings but in what 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.420
 which is production we have the price that 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.340
 is the first two hours are sixteen 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.620
 thousand pesos the additional hour six thousand a 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.720
 all day in 25 thousand pesos we are not 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.080
 talking about that all day good are a 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.080
 called six hours with cut to eat 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.120
 and it's run the helicopter is ready 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.040
 to raise and lower because we have good 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.660
 several batteries and it's time they 're loading 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.289
 and it may be going up and down without 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.719
 limiting 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.580
 what we have also as you said 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.339
 you have to plan the shot it's not about 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.559
 upload it and go around and see what 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:02.860
 it comes out not everything has to be well planned 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:05.559
 and as always the preproduction is what 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.300
 more more important in any 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:08.619
 production that is all the planning that 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.899
 let's do what we want to film 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:13.360
 how do we want to film it etcetera for 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:14.979
 that obviously the result is the 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.189
 adequate and that also the time the 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:19.599
 optimize time and clear because if 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.819
 production does not know what you want I can 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.589
 be around all day but that way you know what 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.899
 they want in two hours three hours you can 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.879
 get what you take that you need not 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.430
 you need more if you already have it planned 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.869
 you leave one after another good we know 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.759
 that then the production there is always something 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:35.740
 that is behind but good this 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.770
 basically if you plan everything you can 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.419
 do in three hours four hours though 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.520
 there is perfect and for people who are 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.809
 interested where they can find then 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.050
 You can find us on Facebook at 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.999
 twitter on video on youtube and all that 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.889
 I fly without wings or watching the finals 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.629
 if someone wants to contact the numbers 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.249
 the mail is appearing on the screen 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.829
 electronic and he 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.569
 the number and the telephone number are usually 

00:06:56.829 --> 00:07:00.339
 enrique rubio let's show you some 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.949
 some images were already seeing 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:05.199
 some images in behind so this 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.559
 more or less of the team working with the 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.809
 with which h 2 there were some situations 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.949
 now with respect to the calibration of 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:15.159
 the camera because it 's the gh two of 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:17.649
 us and this but nevertheless the 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:19.419
 results are excellent as 

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:22.719
 thank you very much enrique and this and 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.069
 now yes yes yes yes we have doubts 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.839
 comments or people make us 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.309
 questions, rest assured that they are 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:29.319
 referring to you because we do this 

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:31.509
 we do not know very much not clear is a 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.119
 pleasure and any doubt for your 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:36.309
 productions with pleasure 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37.689
 we solve well thank you very much and if 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:39.839
 have any doubt any comment by

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:45.599
 www.digitel.com.ve taste we will do what 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.599
 possible to answer any doubt
