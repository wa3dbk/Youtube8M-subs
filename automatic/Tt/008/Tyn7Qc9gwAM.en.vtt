00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 splendor the rubén design to what 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.270
 we talked to rubén he was pretty 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.580
 happy at the beginning but I think that 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.050
 the feeling of happiness 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.460
 he must have changed the measure 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.090
 what happened the night happened to me what 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 same 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 I do not know you have your namesake at the beginning 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.359
 that looks looks pretty good the eba in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.310
 the initial look but to the extent that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 it moved through the scene unfortunately 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 I felt that the transparency on the side 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.840
 it was too wide I am the post of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 immediate martín left too much in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 evidence the gluteus now she was 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530
 with underwear to me he told me rue 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.890
 the night 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 a brave on the side that allowed 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 camouflage let's say this way with that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 he made the same rubén m with a big 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.030
 apparent side so that the eba could 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.870
 be comfortable and obviously with clothes 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 inside 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 the only one then is the one who has not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 searched broke outside in any of the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.720
 activities of the festival you have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 sorry the only 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.930
 right now he told me that one always has 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.920
 to be this underwear because there 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 you also did not breathe 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.960
 but he had then as a kind of 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.760
 lining she was not there was not a game 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 optical but not environment at this time 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.790
 what was done in the part 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.620
 transparent of a santilli insert with 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.840
 lurex on Monday temple that gives you that 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.280
 brightness we live on the sk and want it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.500
 in a way it gives that feeling more 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.970
 theatrical in such an imposing setting 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.760
 as the fifth vergara let's tell 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.590
 also as an anecdote that the decision of 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.190
 opting for this dress was practically 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.240
 half an hour before the same time 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.920
 precisely because of what they counted here 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.600
 I was with a fever and you gave them a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.590
 little bit of fear had to be taken care of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.259
 also your health 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.800
 that's how Eva Gomez looks vulgar with 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.800
 this person 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.829
 look 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.450
 appears on the stage appears in the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.140
 front walking next to Rafael Araneda 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.440
 if the two of black without quite the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.420
 Sober elegant but sober she 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.060
 black therefore neither of the two 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.060
 it stood out too much when she turns 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.160
 obviously it steals attention and leaves 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.930
 a raphael side araneda but I find 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.799
 that you absolutely see thumb with the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.799
 air 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.390
 could be achieved with this dress and in 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.820
 that sense seems to me that it does not correspond 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.820
 and less for the opening night of 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.180
 I totally respect Andrew's opinion 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.740
 because you andré in that first that is the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.510
 respect but also I want 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.570
 transmit rubén disks because rubén 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.070
 in a Chilean designer but toy 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.470
 international scope that is going to 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.550
 turn 30 years of career and I think that 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.480
 we must also transmit what he 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.480
 I wanted to do 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.760
 very well the subject of transparencies 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.610
 in his designs now what he did to 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.700
 through this model is the following a 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.650
 dialogue between the dermis and the dress that 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.959
 It is a language of an artist 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.870
 he wanted somehow the skin and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.079
 the skin will be combined with the clothes now 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.909
 is achieved is achieved I believe that it is achieved 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.950
 but but it was too much and I think that 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.260
 rubén when I talk to him he goes to 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.409
 coincide with me in that I agree with 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.459
 before side it was too much now 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.560
 when the eba went on stage but 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.209
 when it began to move effectively 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.200
 I also felt that when you 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.200
 you find that thumb 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.430
 a little bit strong causes a bit of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.389
 rejection because I felt I felt 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.769
 caused by almost seeing the gluteus 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.579
 sorry as you have to dress then the 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.579
 cheerleader why
