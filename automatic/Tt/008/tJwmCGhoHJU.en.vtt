00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.220
 how do you make such pearls in your flower world 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.529
 could include getting professional user you 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 it requires quite normal perl 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 the important thing is that the holes are big 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.460
 Enough are so then the rubbers 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 can be pulled by it 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.100
 Such pearls exist in all kinds 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.010
 form of variations are good 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.539
 these iron a bead 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.210
 and then you can be so funny 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.550
 push through and from it the users 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 Construction as well as start around her first 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:09.770
 takes a rubber and through a pearl 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:16.770
 your choice riddled press forward 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.009
 under type never dingo so high you think 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 him down here pressed up here can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.479
 her index finger through blankets 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:40.369
 Second, a rubber comes quite normal 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:46.520
 over and over again the bottom becomes the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:51.440
 Upper rubber lives a way and as 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:58.190
 Next comes another rubber and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:03.649
 a pearl on it could share 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:09.220
 finger and intel i7 and provider of 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.220
 lower over the upper 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:22.610
 here arises after the rubber with the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.330
 Pearl comes back in normal rubber 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 without a breakdown 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:48.040
 after that, a computer could do it once 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.040
 over the index finger once ago ago 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.690
 then again a combination without panic 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330
 under 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 so you can recognize 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:34.530
 that had signed up I still do 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:39.910
 neither on the middle finger of the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.510
 lower and rest of a poor again 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:51.280
 a piece of ling I've got this before 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:56.890
 prepared by doing this kind of 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.920
 bracelet made over two pins and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.709
 you want to show yourself how 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.989
 the conclusion of such a bracelet 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.100
 do 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.100
 So we'll take it again 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.120
 here we have the per attorney the part 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.140
 with the green by the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:46.250
 then a simple rubber and there 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:50.660
 Now we just put it out and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:56.750
 one further still here through 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.750
 one asked and with the pen 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.760
 however, it is the end of it with 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.950
 we can provide a pearl 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.560
 Do not hook a hair that you can 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.240
 for example 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.450
 this part only a keychain 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.940
 I want to use it down there 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.470
 However, becoming a professional to us 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.810
 should 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.810
 take another short and 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:38.270
 push that down through the hole 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:38.270
 by the perl with guilty 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:50.910
 if I was at that time hard or otherwise 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:06:01.080
 with a toothpick just there 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:08.780
 I could already take it then 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:10.920
 Rubber together over the fingers in it 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:18.660
 we have not lost 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:21.000
 Slips through this is yet to come 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.600
 not the hook but I take one 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:33.140
 put more rubber into the Chinese 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.140
 and then our partner introduced 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:50.160
 then he has that conclusion here 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:55.710
 even I hope it has this 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:58.380
 fell and could be good afterwards 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.460
 work and then I wish you a lot 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:06.530
 joy with your new pearls users 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.530
