to use an exacto knife you can also use

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
to use an exacto knife you can also use
just<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.260> pair<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> scissors<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.549> could<00:01:14.700> also

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
just a pair of scissors you could also

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
just a pair of scissors you could also
just<00:01:15.000> cut<00:01:15.330> holes<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> lid<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> box<00:01:16.409> but

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
just cut holes in the lid of the box but
I<00:01:16.770> found<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.130> using<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> fabric<00:01:17.759> gives

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I found that using the fabric gives

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
I found that using the fabric gives
their<00:01:18.360> hands<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:19.110> room<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> move

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
their hands a little more room to move

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
their hands a little more room to move
and<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.430> ready<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> put<00:01:20.820> our<00:01:20.880> goodies
