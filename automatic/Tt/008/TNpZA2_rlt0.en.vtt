00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.779
 welcome in what can I help you 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.160
 thank you very much 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.620
 Well, to say it, man is not to feel 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 empathy for technology and marries a 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.660
 good tool to work from 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.610
 efficient way but my owner does not give 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.930
 realize that when they spend a lot of time 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.930
 in front of the screen 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 this is why I feel that my little body 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.850
 burns 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.870
 they just do not react until they do not 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.010
 is we start to do is when 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.449
 they react 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.449
 it's more me before and now 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.399
 Technology helps us in many things 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 however occasionally also be 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.110
 generate damages and disorders such as those 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.409
 they tell me is very explain what is it 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.259
 What's up 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.109
 the blue light emitted by monitors is 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.969
 similar to ultraviolet rays is 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.969
 why they go through the tour 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:43.460
 It's the crystal iris and I'm glad to get there 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.460
 to the retina 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.960
 which ends up being damaged 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.070
 some symptoms can be disorders 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.010
 of sleep fatigue and dryness in 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.170
 delicate subject eyes because the lack of 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.740
 ocular lubrication can generate a 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.470
 you will be that's why in 21 we develop 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.380
 the low blue light technology which 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.810
 Significantly reduces the emission 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.090
 of blue light in this way we avoid the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.000
 damages that you have suffered and that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.370
 others will no longer suffer now put 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.120
 attention I want you to see a few seconds 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.120
 this picture 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.740
 with the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.560
 this same flicker occurs in the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.260
 monitors only that at a lot speed 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.900
 greater and that is not detected with the naked eye 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.380
 this constant flicker can generate 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.870
 among other things headache or 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.050
 irritation in the eyes I will teach you a 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.030
 trick that shows this effect for this 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.270
 we will ask for help at our hand 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.209
 artist put their smartphone in mode 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.670
 video recording and place the front 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.180
 the monitors will be able to observe this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.430
 effect consequently the eyes irritate 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.100
 for staying for a long time 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.260
 in front of a monitor the technology 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.590
 free flicker incorporated in the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.780
 Monitors 21 eliminates this flicker and for 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.170
 thus prevents the eyes from being 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.170
 hurt 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 it's just what we need good what 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.920
 our owners need 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.050
 listen to their eyes they know what 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.050
 what do you need
