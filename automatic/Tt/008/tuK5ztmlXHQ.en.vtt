00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
glowing green it almost looked like

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.140 
glowing green it almost looked like
someone<00:00:24.410> taking<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.860> highlighter<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.610> drawn<00:00:26.119> a

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
little thin line on top of each vineyard

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.840 
little thin line on top of each vineyard
row<00:00:29.119> now<00:00:30.080> I<00:00:30.110> knew<00:00:30.289> what<00:00:30.440> that<00:00:30.470> was<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.250> not

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
row now I knew what that was but not

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.150

wanting<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.180> miss<00:00:32.360> an<00:00:32.509> opportunity<00:00:32.840> I<00:00:33.560> turned

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
wanting to miss an opportunity I turned

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.490 
wanting to miss an opportunity I turned
to<00:00:34.250> him<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:34.579> said<00:00:34.810> yeah<00:00:35.810> I<00:00:35.840> think<00:00:36.350> we're

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
to him and I said yeah I think we're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900 
to him and I said yeah I think we're
here<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:36.800> nuclear<00:00:37.280> plant<00:00:37.610> that<00:00:37.760> they<00:00:37.820> were

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
here that nuclear plant that they were

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.310 
here that nuclear plant that they were
talking<00:00:38.239> about<00:00:38.329> it<00:00:38.630> this<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.020> like<00:00:39.050> one<00:00:39.170> of

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
talking about it this is like one of

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.190 
talking about it this is like one of
those<00:00:39.440> side<00:00:39.800> effect<00:00:40.160> things<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.750> grapes<00:00:42.050> are

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
those side effect things the grapes are

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.319 
those side effect things the grapes are
okay<00:00:42.470> though<00:00:42.500> then<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.820> next<00:00:43.940> thing<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.270> know

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
okay though then the next thing I know

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.330 
okay though then the next thing I know
he's<00:00:44.809> rolling<00:00:45.440> his<00:00:45.470> eyes<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:45.980> calling<00:00:46.220> me

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
he's rolling his eyes and calling me

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.549 
he's rolling his eyes and calling me
anyway<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.420> reason<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:47.720> went<00:00:48.020> down<00:00:48.230> is

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
anyway the reason that went down is

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.549 
anyway the reason that went down is
behind<00:00:49.309> me<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:50.239> was<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.840> netting<00:00:51.290> on<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
behind me it was the netting on the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.750 
behind me it was the netting on the
vines<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.070> that's<00:00:52.219> what<00:00:52.399> gives<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.700> that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
vines and that's what gives it that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240 
vines and that's what gives it that
green<00:00:53.180> glow<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:54.200> Sun<00:00:54.469> hits<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:55.160> the
