00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
foams right here perforated so you're

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.889 
foams right here perforated so you're

really<00:01:27.590> great<00:01:27.770> protection<00:01:28.279> on<00:01:28.399> this<00:01:28.549> one<00:01:28.789> they

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
really great protection on this one they

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:30.639 
really great protection on this one they
just<00:01:29.149> kind<00:01:29.329> of<00:01:29.389> you<00:01:29.630> know<00:01:29.810> lessen<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.409> bulk

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
just kind of you know lessen the bulk

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.190 
just kind of you know lessen the bulk
you<00:01:31.159> have<00:01:31.310> large<00:01:31.609> plastic<00:01:31.969> inserts<00:01:32.569> segmented

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
you have large plastic inserts segmented

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.379 
you have large plastic inserts segmented
right<00:01:33.349> here<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.579> curved<00:01:34.939> kind<00:01:35.299> of

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
right here and and curved kind of

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:37.449 
right here and and curved kind of
contoured<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.200> they<00:01:36.380> wrap<00:01:36.619> really<00:01:37.219> nicely

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
contoured so they wrap really nicely

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.089 
contoured so they wrap really nicely
around<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.029> front<00:01:38.299> of<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.420> arm<00:01:38.709> as<00:01:39.709> well<00:01:39.950> like
