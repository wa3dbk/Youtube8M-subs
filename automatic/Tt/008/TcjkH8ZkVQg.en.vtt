00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
cancer and there's also another cancer

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.059 
cancer and there's also another cancer
called<00:05:02.330> urinary<00:05:02.810> bladder<00:05:02.960> cancer<00:05:03.560> that

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
called urinary bladder cancer that

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.339 
called urinary bladder cancer that
affects<00:05:04.099> much<00:05:04.580> more<00:05:04.819> people<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.659> affects<00:05:05.810> men

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
affects much more people it affects men

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.399 
affects much more people it affects men
and<00:05:06.500> women<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:06.949> it's<00:05:07.849> simmering<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.659> in

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
and women and it's simmering the in

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.529 
and women and it's simmering the in
terms<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:10.039> affecting<00:05:10.639> urinary<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.449> sexual

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
terms of affecting urinary and sexual

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.659 
terms of affecting urinary and sexual
functioning<00:05:12.349> so<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:12.949> think<00:05:13.039> there's<00:05:13.370> a<00:05:13.430> lot<00:05:13.610> we

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
functioning so I think there's a lot we

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.730 
functioning so I think there's a lot we
could<00:05:14.000> learn<00:05:14.300> from<00:05:14.539> running<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.439> penile

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
could learn from running the penile

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.550 
could learn from running the penile
cancer<00:05:16.099> study<00:05:16.370> from<00:05:16.909> the<00:05:17.180> impact<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.199> has<00:05:18.379> on

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
cancer study from the impact it has on

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.980 
cancer study from the impact it has on
people's<00:05:18.919> live<00:05:19.129> to<00:05:19.759> conduct<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.389> same<00:05:20.599> study

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
people's live to conduct the same study

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.339 
people's live to conduct the same study
on<00:05:21.229> urinary<00:05:21.650> bladder<00:05:21.889> cancer
