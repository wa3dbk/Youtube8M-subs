00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.129 
now we know this is the count we we we
are<00:06:26.979> boosting<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:30.789> this<00:06:30.969> should<00:06:31.360> is<00:06:31.749> supposed

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
are boosting and this should is supposed

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.049 
are boosting and this should is supposed
to<00:06:32.199> go<00:06:32.319> real<00:06:32.499> fast<00:06:32.679> as<00:06:32.889> well<00:06:33.099> yeah<00:06:35.789> let's<00:06:36.789> see

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:37.059 
to go real fast as well yeah let's see

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:41.040 
to go real fast as well yeah let's see
here<00:06:37.300> we<00:06:38.050> are<00:06:38.110> going<00:06:38.259> to<00:06:38.379> enable<00:06:38.499> speed<00:06:39.059> to<00:06:40.059> to

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
here we are going to enable speed to to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.519 
here we are going to enable speed to to
get<00:06:41.229> some<00:06:41.740> efficiency<00:06:42.399> of<00:06:42.580> it<00:06:42.699> and<00:06:43.479> if<00:06:44.379> you

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:44.529 
get some efficiency of it and if you

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.980 
get some efficiency of it and if you
just<00:06:44.709> use<00:06:44.860> one<00:06:45.339> account<00:06:45.639> i<00:06:45.879> really<00:06:46.509> recommend

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
just use one account i really recommend

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.769 
just use one account i really recommend
like<00:06:47.830> speed<00:06:48.339> Oh<00:06:48.610> point<00:06:49.269> one<00:06:50.009> cuz<00:06:51.179> yeah<00:06:52.179> I'm<00:06:52.360> the

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:52.779 
like speed Oh point one cuz yeah I'm the

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.309 
like speed Oh point one cuz yeah I'm the
EU<00:06:53.110> there's<00:06:53.619> a<00:06:53.740> lot<00:06:53.949> of<00:06:53.979> people<00:06:54.189> using<00:06:55.319> using

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
EU there's a lot of people using using

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:01.139 
EU there's a lot of people using using
similar<00:06:57.219> BOTS<00:06:57.519> and<00:06:58.769> the<00:06:59.769> delay<00:07:00.129> might<00:07:00.429> be<00:07:00.669> 1<00:07:01.119> or

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:01.149 
similar BOTS and the delay might be 1 or

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.399 
similar BOTS and the delay might be 1 or
0<00:07:02.050> point<00:07:02.769> 8<00:07:03.039> or<00:07:03.669> anything<00:07:04.389> because<00:07:05.019> if<00:07:05.289> the

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
0 point 8 or anything because if the

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.079 
0 point 8 or anything because if the
only<00:07:05.619> is<00:07:05.739> one<00:07:05.979> account<00:07:06.249> you<00:07:06.369> really<00:07:06.729> want<00:07:06.939> to
