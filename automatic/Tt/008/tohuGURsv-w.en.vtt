Origins Method

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.220
Climb Up

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.280
Part 1

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.860
Hey! Whats up guys! This is Res and Tom

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.770
We're at Origins Parkour Facility

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.520
And today we're coming to you with the Origins
Method for teaching the climb up

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.390
Now, the climb up, although appearing to be
a simple skill

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.940
actually requires quite bit of technical coordination

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.860
and relative strength

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.480
So, we're gonna start off with some general
strength recommendations

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.720
General Strength Exercises

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.780
Pull Ups

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.040
Knees to Elbows

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.200
Dips

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.640
Suggested Structures for Progression

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.680
Overgrip Rail on a Wall

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.320
Overgrip Wall

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.400
Flat Wall

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.940
Climbing Position

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.020
Okay, so the first step is to establish position
in the climb up

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.590
So, we're gonna use the rail that's mounted
to a wall to eliminate any intensities of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.860
grip or just general strength

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.700
He is gonna walk his feet up the wall until
they are about even with his hips

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.400
He's gonna drop his non power leg down

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.680
And I'm gonna pull his foot of the wall

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.810
So, this is a less balance position, cause
is only one foot place on the wall

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.010
So I'm gonna make in the make sure he has
contact with the wall

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.000
there is no really any weight on there

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.799
So its top knee its gonna be turn out

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.799
You notice that his hips gets closer to the
wall

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.339
Its really important to have good hip mobility
to get into an optimal position of pull

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
And finally his foot is gonna be placed flat
against the wall

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.299
to allow to roll up when he pulls

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.539
His arms are kept long to mimic the bottom
position of the climb up

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.279
to initiate the pull

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.749
So once we've established this optimal climb
up position, we can then move on to some special

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.930
strength exercises that can help develop the
climb up

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.220
Special Exercises

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.000
Wall Climbers

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.180
Cat Hang Pull-Ups

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.760
Cat Hang Leg Press

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:05.840
Climb Up Eccentrics

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.520
Hip Lifts

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200
Drill #1
Reactive Set

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.520
Okay, so the first drill we are gonna take
a look at is the reactive set up

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.650
The purpose of this drill is to utilize the
stretch reflex that happens at the bottom

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.719
of our pull to increase the high of our pull

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.320
So we'll take a look at what it looks like

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.000
Wanna choose a low obstacle so that we can
jump off of the ground into our set up

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.339
Good, okay so he is gonna take his non power
leg, place it on the wall with his hands gripping

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.949
the top of the wall

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:51.269
He is gonna jump up and set his power foot
above his hips

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.529
He is gonna keep his arms as long to get ready
for the pull

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.389
Once we have establish a good position in
the reactive set up, we can move on to the

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.169
drill call the high pull

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.060
Drill #2
High Pull

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.400
Okay, so the high pull is an exercise we use
to optimize the output of our pull phase in

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.569
the climb up

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.000
A good pull should leave you with your arms
pretty much straight to allow for a much faster

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.030
mount

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.090
Lets see how one looks like

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.500
Okay so, remember that when you're performing
this you are not actually doing a climb up,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.230
so you're not gonna switch your hands

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.160
Show an early hand switch

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.810
Yes so when he is switching his hands early
he is not actually completing his pull

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.990
You wanna wait to the high of your pull before
you switch your hands

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.150
What it's also doing is he is gonna utilize
a knee drive

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.620
Lets see a good knee drive

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.780
So the knee drive is basically like you're
graving someone by their shoulders, and right

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.430
after you pull, you knee him in the chest

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.910
This exercise should be performed for single
repetitions

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.970
You wanna ensure the most quality, so make
sure you rest in between

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.370
An optimal high pull it's gonna have you start
and end in the same position

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.810
Lets take a look at that

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.020
And as soon as you're done you can drop off
the wall, shake your arms and do another one

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.200
Drill #3
Ground Top Out

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.340
Okay so the next drill we're gonna cover is
the "top out"

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.050
The top out itself is a technique use to mount
on top of a wall after the catch phase of

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.950
a climb up

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.420
So we're gonna choose a low structure to allow us to reduce the intensity by jumping off of the ground

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.320
He is gonna place his hands on top of the
box and place his non power leg against the wall

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.610
The reason we do that is because that's the
knee drive leg and it's gonna make for a smother

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.120
transition into the top out

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.950
So he is gonna take his power leg, he is gonna
drive his heel back pulling his hips up as

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.780
high as possible

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.390
When he does it he leans onto his hands

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.750
Once he is comfortable getting his hips up
as high as he can he is gonna try a mount

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.990
on top of the box

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.140
Again he is landing with his hips up as high
as possible

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.910
Once he is comfortable using a structure like
this low box, he can move on to a flat wall

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.520
Okay guys, that's it for the Origins Method
for the Climb Up

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.190
Make sure you stay tuned for part two and
other instructional videos
