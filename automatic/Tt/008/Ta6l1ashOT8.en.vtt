00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
I'd like you to think about

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.480 
I'd like you to think about
incorporating<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> different<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.460> of

part of the problem with gunfights is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.400 
part of the problem with gunfights is
that<00:00:35.070> shooting<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.579> only<00:00:35.880> 10%<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that shooting is only 10% of it the

that shooting is only 10% of it the
other<00:00:37.590> 90%<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.520> situational<00:00:39.120> awareness

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
other 90% is situational awareness

we force ourselves to diagnose identify

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.119 
we force ourselves to diagnose identify
a<00:00:47.850> solution<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.989> enact<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> solution

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
a solution and then enact that solution

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
a solution and then enact that solution
is<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> energy<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.020> cerebral

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
is time and energy that our cerebral

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
is time and energy that our cerebral
cortex<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> using<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.699> could<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.120> used<00:00:54.420> for

cortex is using that could be used for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
cortex is using that could be used for
the<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.989> 90%<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.920> gun<00:00:56.129> fighting<00:00:56.399> I'd<00:00:56.879> like

the other 90% of gun fighting I'd like

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.209 
the other 90% of gun fighting I'd like
you<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.329> about<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.920> term<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you to think about what what we term a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
you to think about what what we term a
progressive<00:00:59.969> malfunction<00:01:00.570> clearance<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.140> know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
progressive malfunction clearance I know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
progressive malfunction clearance I know
you<00:01:01.680> guys<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.129> done<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> before<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you guys have done that before it and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
you guys have done that before it and
you're<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> doing<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.379> way<00:01:04.619> but

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're kind of doing it the same way but

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
you're kind of doing it the same way but
I'd<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.390> what's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
I'd like you to not think about what's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.850 
I'd like you to not think about what's
wrong<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> gun<00:01:07.530> until<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
wrong with the gun until you have to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
wrong with the gun until you have to
we've<00:01:10.860> broken<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.340> malfunctions<00:01:12.330> into

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
we've broken down malfunctions into

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
we've broken down malfunctions into
three<00:01:12.990> types<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.680> those<00:01:14.340> types<00:01:14.700> are

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
three types and those types are

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
three types and those types are
identified<00:01:15.570> by<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> clear<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.220> not

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
identified by how you clear them not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
identified by how you clear them not
what<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.540> we're<00:01:18.689> cutting<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.110> two

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
what they are so we're cutting out two

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.730 
what they are so we're cutting out two
steps<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.159> memory<00:01:21.030> resolution<00:01:21.840> inside<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
steps of memory resolution inside of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
steps of memory resolution inside of
your<00:01:22.860> brain<00:01:23.299> identifying<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
your brain identifying what it is and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
your brain identifying what it is and
then<00:01:25.290> finding<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> solution<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.970> I'd<00:01:27.060> like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
then finding the solution what I'd like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.620 
then finding the solution what I'd like
you<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.110> simple<00:01:29.329> complex<00:01:30.329> and
