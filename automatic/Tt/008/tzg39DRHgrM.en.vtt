videos down below alright let's get
right<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
right to this so what you want to do is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.130 
right to this so what you want to do is
when<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.460> after<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.850> built<00:00:24.060> your<00:00:24.210> inner

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
when you after you built your inner

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.019 
when you after you built your inner
mechanism<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.039> after<00:00:26.369> you've<00:00:26.519> figured<00:00:26.849> out

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
mechanism and after you've figured out

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
mechanism and after you've figured out
how<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> build<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> PEZ<00:00:27.720> dispenser<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.710> want

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
how to build the PEZ dispenser you want

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.720 
how to build the PEZ dispenser you want
to<00:00:28.920> come<00:00:29.010> over<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> reset<00:00:29.970> switch<00:00:31.730> come

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
to come over from the reset switch come

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
to come over from the reset switch come
over<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:34.219> come<00:00:35.219> out<00:00:35.309> three<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.980> then<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.190> one

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
over one come out three and then up one

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.450 
over one come out three and then up one
more<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:40.040> pressure<00:00:41.040> plate

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
more and put your pressure plate

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
more and put your pressure plate
pressure<00:00:42.030> pad<00:00:42.300> wooden<00:00:42.719> pressure<00:00:42.870> plate<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pressure pad wooden pressure plate and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
pressure pad wooden pressure plate and
once<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.340> where<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> put<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> pressure

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
once you know where to put the pressure

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.049 
once you know where to put the pressure
plate<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.690> much<00:00:45.899> you're<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.440> pack<00:00:46.710> with

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
plate pretty much you're down pack with

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.430 
plate pretty much you're down pack with
setting<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> entire<00:00:48.570> PEZ<00:00:48.840> dispenser<00:00:48.870> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
setting up the entire PEZ dispenser I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.510 
setting up the entire PEZ dispenser I
don't<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.860> need<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> show<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.309> how<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
don't really need to show you how to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.380 
don't really need to show you how to
build<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.210> again<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.579> once<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> get

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
build that all again so once you get

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
build that all again so once you get
that<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.690> built<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.230> might<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> pause

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that all built you might want to pause

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319 
that all built you might want to pause
the<00:00:55.980> video<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.610> gonna<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.210> keep

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the video because I'm gonna just keep

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
the video because I'm gonna just keep
talking<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.250> underneath<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.879> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
talking so we come underneath and right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
talking so we come underneath and right
now<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.260> set<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.039> two

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
now I have it set up where it's a two

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
now I have it set up where it's a two
drop-down<00:01:03.470> with<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> normal<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
drop-down with a normal and then a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.460 
drop-down with a normal and then a
powered<00:01:06.299> rail<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> put<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> normal

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
powered rail you want to put that normal

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.880 
powered rail you want to put that normal
then<00:01:07.650> powered<00:01:08.010> rail<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:09.000> does<00:01:09.210> matter

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
then powered rail it does matter

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.690 
then powered rail it does matter
alright<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> gotta<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.580> some<00:01:11.909> rails

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
alright so I gotta get out some rails

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.480 
alright so I gotta get out some rails
some<00:01:14.700> powered<00:01:15.299> rails<00:01:16.220> don't<00:01:17.220> need<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
some powered rails don't need that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.350 
some powered rails don't need that
pressure<00:01:17.700> plate<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.840> redstone<00:01:19.280> so

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
pressure plate and some redstone so

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.460 
pressure plate and some redstone so
after<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> come<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> come

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
after you come down to you want to come

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.640 
after you come down to you want to come
out<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.950> more<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.310> regular<00:01:23.700> rail<00:01:24.500> put<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
out one more with the regular rail put a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.490 
out one more with the regular rail put a
detector<00:01:26.130> rail<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:28.100> regular<00:01:29.100> rail<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:30.500> detector

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
detector rail a regular rail a detector

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
detector rail a regular rail a detector
rail<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> powered<00:01:33.869> rail<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:34.850> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
rail and then a powered rail here so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.469 
rail and then a powered rail here so
looks<00:01:36.030> something<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.270> want

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
looks something like this then you want

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
looks something like this then you want
to<00:01:39.540> come<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.290> three<00:01:41.329> from<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> ground<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to come up three from the ground so one

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.480 
to come up three from the ground so one
two<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:46.380> put<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> powered<00:01:46.890> rail<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
two and then put a powered rail up here

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.880 
two and then put a powered rail up here
make<00:01:47.729> sure<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.030> come<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.930> regular<00:01:49.530> rails

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
make sure you come up to regular rails

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.910 
make sure you come up to regular rails
then<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> powered<00:01:50.520> rail<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.970> does<00:01:51.270> matter

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
then a powered rail that does matter

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.660 
then a powered rail that does matter
because<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.490> human

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
because that would be your human

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
because that would be your human
detector<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.540> no<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.049> gets<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:55.619> car

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
detector so no one gets in the my car

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
detector so no one gets in the my car
and<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> minecart<00:01:56.460> comes<00:01:56.640> down<00:01:57.020> they<00:01:58.020> don't

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and the minecart comes down they don't

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.270 
and the minecart comes down they don't
let<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> minecart<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.189> show

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
let me just put a minecart down and show

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.320 
let me just put a minecart down and show
you

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
you

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.800 
you
we<00:02:00.690> put<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.410> minecart<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:03.270> doesn't<00:02:03.690> make

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
we put a minecart down it doesn't make

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.300 
we put a minecart down it doesn't make
it<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.140> comes<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> goes<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it it comes back and then it goes the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
it it comes back and then it goes the
opposite<00:02:05.670> direction<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> know<00:02:09.630> what

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
opposite direction so now you know what

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
opposite direction so now you know what
I<00:02:09.960> do<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.070> iron<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.520> me<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.820> let's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
I do actually have iron on me so let's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.550 
I do actually have iron on me so let's
go<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.330> clock<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.870> bring<00:02:12.930> out<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.260> iron

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
go to this clock and bring out this iron

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
go to this clock and bring out this iron
block<00:02:13.800> after<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.240> got<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.570> powered<00:02:15.960> rail

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
block after you got that powered rail

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.080 
block after you got that powered rail
there<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.410> put<00:02:16.590> another<00:02:17.130> powered<00:02:17.490> rail<00:02:17.700> up

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
there you put another powered rail up

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.320 
there you put another powered rail up
here<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:21.750> up<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:22.200> more<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.680> put<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.330> detector

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
here go up one more and put a detector

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540 
here go up one more and put a detector
rail<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.650> break<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> bottom<00:02:26.400> block

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
rail there and break that bottom block

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.650 
rail there and break that bottom block
because<00:02:26.820> we're<00:02:27.060> gonna<00:02:27.180> actually<00:02:27.330> need<00:02:27.510> that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
because we're gonna actually need that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
because we're gonna actually need that
room<00:02:28.020> later<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.310> now<00:02:29.310> we're<00:02:29.460> gonna<00:02:29.550> come<00:02:29.730> over

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
room later on now we're gonna come over

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.190 
room later on now we're gonna come over
to<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.030> repeater<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.750> showed<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.110> how

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to that repeater that I showed you how

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.630 
to that repeater that I showed you how
to<00:02:31.230> build<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> Pez<00:02:31.830> dispensers<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.310> had

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to build in the Pez dispensers that had

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040 
to build in the Pez dispensers that had
nothing<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.090> do<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.720> PEZ<00:02:34.020> dispenser

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
nothing to do with the PEZ dispenser

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.770 
nothing to do with the PEZ dispenser
itself<00:02:34.710> this<00:02:35.370> has<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.360> minecart

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
itself this has to do with the minecart

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.080 
itself this has to do with the minecart
track<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:37.920> we're<00:02:38.070> gonna<00:02:38.160> do<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.670> bring

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
track so what we're gonna do is bring

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.410 
track so what we're gonna do is bring
this<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:40.200> down<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.300> already

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
this all the way down here and I already

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.470 
this all the way down here and I already
cut<00:02:42.690> out<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> slot<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.440> myself<00:02:43.880> because<00:02:44.880> this

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
cut out a slot for myself because this

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.449 
cut out a slot for myself because this
is<00:02:45.660> where<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.080> part<00:02:46.410> comes<00:02:46.650> into<00:02:46.860> place<00:02:47.100> like

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
is where this part comes into place like

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.980 
is where this part comes into place like

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.250 
area for these detector rails and we're
going<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.060> put<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:58.070> repeater<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.430> and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
going to put a repeater here and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
going to put a repeater here and
redstone<00:04:01.260> coming<00:04:01.620> down<00:04:01.769> onto<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.250> torch

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
redstone coming down onto this torch

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.970 
redstone coming down onto this torch
now<00:04:04.940> we're<00:04:05.210> gonna<00:04:05.300> take<00:04:05.570> our<00:04:05.840> redstone<00:04:06.800> dust

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
now we're gonna take our redstone dust

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.340 
now we're gonna take our redstone dust
and<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.240> hook<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.450> up<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.750> loop<00:04:08.990> it<00:04:09.080> around

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
and just hook it up and loop it around

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.040 
and just hook it up and loop it around
to<00:04:09.590> over<00:04:09.800> here<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.510> we're<00:04:11.690> gonna<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:11.900> another

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
to over here and we're gonna put another

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.670 
to over here and we're gonna put another
repeater<00:04:12.710> there<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:15.380> it<00:04:15.440> looks<00:04:15.470> something

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
repeater there so it looks something

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.630 
repeater there so it looks something
like<00:04:15.860> that<00:04:18.310> now<00:04:19.310> we're<00:04:19.489> gonna<00:04:19.579> take<00:04:19.880> our

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
like that now we're gonna take our

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.100 
like that now we're gonna take our
redstone<00:04:22.640> dust<00:04:22.880> well<00:04:23.540> actually<00:04:23.660> first<00:04:23.870> put<00:04:24.080> a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
redstone dust well actually first put a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.540 
redstone dust well actually first put a
repeater<00:04:24.380> right<00:04:24.620> here<00:04:24.770> as<00:04:24.860> well<00:04:24.980> just<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.400> make

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
repeater right here as well just to make

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.400 
repeater right here as well just to make
sure<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.300> case<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.630> put<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.960> too<00:04:27.110> far<00:04:27.350> you

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
sure like in case you put it too far you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.980 
sure like in case you put it too far you
don't<00:04:27.650> want<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:28.010> not<00:04:28.130> make<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.610> all<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.820> way

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
don't want it to not make it all the way

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.840 
don't want it to not make it all the way
so<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:30.290> add<00:04:30.650> another<00:04:30.920> repeater<00:04:31.280> there<00:04:31.520> and

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so I just add another repeater there and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.380 
so I just add another repeater there and
we're<00:04:32.030> just<00:04:32.090> gonna<00:04:32.240> hook<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.450> together<00:04:34.390> now

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
we're just gonna hook it together now

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.970 
we're just gonna hook it together now
we're<00:04:35.660> gonna<00:04:35.750> come<00:04:35.960> over<00:04:36.020> back<00:04:36.350> down<00:04:36.620> here<00:04:36.860> to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
we're gonna come over back down here to

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.320 
we're gonna come over back down here to
where<00:04:37.100> this<00:04:37.280> detector<00:04:38.270> rail<00:04:38.480> is<00:04:40.210> we're<00:04:41.210> going

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
where this detector rail is we're going

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.790 
where this detector rail is we're going
to<00:04:41.419> put<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> block<00:04:41.870> underneath<00:04:42.320> it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
to put a block underneath it

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.130 
to put a block underneath it
and<00:04:43.190> then<00:04:43.820> we're<00:04:43.910> gonna<00:04:44.030> run<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.390> all<00:04:44.630> the

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
and then we're gonna run this all the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.450 
and then we're gonna run this all the
way<00:04:45.230> down<00:04:46.600> well<00:04:47.600> not<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:48.200> far<00:04:48.470> just<00:04:48.710> run<00:04:49.340> it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
way down well not this far just run it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.940 
way down well not this far just run it
all<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.669> way<00:04:49.760> over<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.030> here<00:04:50.390> and<00:04:50.710> then<00:04:51.710> make<00:04:51.919> a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
all the way over to here and then make a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.820 
all the way over to here and then make a
staircase<00:04:52.280> up<00:04:54.430> like<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.640> and<00:04:56.710> then<00:04:57.710> we're

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
staircase up like that and then we're

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.240 
staircase up like that and then we're
going<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.070> put<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.550> repeater<00:04:59.000> here<00:05:00.160> because<00:05:01.160> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
going to put a repeater here because you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.710 
going to put a repeater here because you
don't<00:05:01.370> want<00:05:01.580> these<00:05:01.760> two<00:05:01.940> interfering<00:05:02.600> with

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
don't want these two interfering with

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.590 
don't want these two interfering with
each<00:05:02.750> other<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.560> case<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.360> then<00:05:05.510> we're

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
each other just in case and then we're

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.940 
each other just in case and then we're
gonna<00:05:05.690> just<00:05:05.930> run<00:05:06.050> our<00:05:06.169> redstone<00:05:06.500> right<00:05:06.650> to

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
gonna just run our redstone right to

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.550 
gonna just run our redstone right to
underneath<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.940> detector<00:05:08.479> rail<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:09.380> just

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
underneath that detector rail so just

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.840 
underneath that detector rail so just
make<00:05:09.710> sure<00:05:09.740> everything<00:05:10.130> works<00:05:10.280> by<00:05:10.520> like<00:05:10.729> you

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
make sure everything works by like you

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.159 
make sure everything works by like you
know<00:05:10.970> going<00:05:11.240> over<00:05:11.360> here<00:05:11.600> see<00:05:11.720> how<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.960> torch

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
know going over here see how the torch

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.250 
know going over here see how the torch
goes<00:05:12.350> off<00:05:12.500> perfect<00:05:13.010> that's<00:05:13.130> what<00:05:13.280> we<00:05:13.370> want

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
goes off perfect that's what we want

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.550 
goes off perfect that's what we want
that's<00:05:15.260> so<00:05:15.590> when<00:05:16.960> someone<00:05:17.960> clicks<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.380> thing

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
that's so when someone clicks a thing

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.080 
that's so when someone clicks a thing
and<00:05:18.710> then<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.890> human<00:05:19.190> detector<00:05:19.580> comes<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:19.970> can

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
and then the human detector comes it can

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.700 
and then the human detector comes it can
still<00:05:20.300> reset<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.870> whole<00:05:21.050> thing<00:05:21.940> alright<00:05:22.940> and

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
still reset the whole thing alright and

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.570 
still reset the whole thing alright and
there<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.740> guys<00:05:24.860> have<00:05:24.919> it<00:05:25.160> that's<00:05:25.400> how<00:05:25.550> you

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
there you guys have it that's how you

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.250 
there you guys have it that's how you
pretty<00:05:25.970> much<00:05:26.120> just<00:05:26.180> setup<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.840> whole<00:05:26.990> entire

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
pretty much just setup the whole entire

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.260 
pretty much just setup the whole entire
thing<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.520> now<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.060> click<00:05:30.400> let's<00:05:31.400> say<00:05:31.900> three

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
thing so now if I click let's say three

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.950 
thing so now if I click let's say three
and<00:05:35.270> once<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.110> get<00:05:36.290> in<00:05:36.410> there<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:38.110> can't<00:05:39.110> click<00:05:40.960> on

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
and once I get in there I can't click on

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
and once I get in there I can't click on
the<00:05:42.290> other<00:05:42.380> train<00:05:42.770> station<00:05:43.190> beautiful<00:05:43.610> see

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
the other train station beautiful see

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.480 
the other train station beautiful see
how<00:05:43.970> it<00:05:44.120> works<00:05:44.330> because<00:05:44.919> what<00:05:45.919> this<00:05:46.040> does<00:05:46.100> is

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
how it works because what this does is

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.490 
how it works because what this does is
this<00:05:46.700> will<00:05:46.760> come<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.660> power<00:05:48.020> will<00:05:48.229> come<00:05:48.350> all

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
this will come the power will come all

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.000 
this will come the power will come all
the<00:05:48.590> way<00:05:48.680> down<00:05:48.830> here<00:05:50.560> come<00:05:51.560> through<00:05:51.800> that

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
the way down here come through that

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.360 
the way down here come through that
sticky<00:05:52.640> piston<00:05:53.440> over<00:05:54.440> in<00:05:54.500> here<00:05:54.650> turn<00:05:54.890> off<00:05:54.919> all

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
sticky piston over in here turn off all

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.469 
sticky piston over in here turn off all
the<00:05:55.520> torches<00:05:55.930> besides<00:05:58.000> besides<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.330> one

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
the torches besides besides the one

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:00.850 
the torches besides besides the one
that's<00:05:59.720> already<00:05:59.900> up<00:06:00.169> because<00:06:00.440> this<00:06:00.560> can't

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
that's already up because this can't

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.860 
that's already up because this can't
grab<00:06:01.160> a<00:06:01.490> sticky<00:06:02.030> piston<00:06:02.180> that's<00:06:02.479> already<00:06:02.690> up

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
grab a sticky piston that's already up

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.320 
grab a sticky piston that's already up
and<00:06:03.710> will<00:06:03.860> grab<00:06:04.010> every<00:06:04.340> other<00:06:04.490> piston<00:06:05.000> so<00:06:05.180> no

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
and will grab every other piston so no

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.439
