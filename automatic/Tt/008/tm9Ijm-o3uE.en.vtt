00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.420 

I<00:00:23.870> think<00:00:24.620> there<00:00:24.710> are<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.860> number<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.280> advantages

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
I think there are a number of advantages

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.120 
I think there are a number of advantages
to<00:00:26.390> students<00:00:26.810> doing<00:00:26.990> our<00:00:27.290> particular<00:00:27.590> courses

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
to students doing our particular courses

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.400 
to students doing our particular courses
the<00:00:28.550> first<00:00:28.820> is<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:29.120> it's<00:00:29.420> project<00:00:29.900> centered

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
the first is that it's project centered

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.310 
the first is that it's project centered
so<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.130> not<00:00:31.370> that<00:00:31.610> we<00:00:31.820> are<00:00:32.290> kind<00:00:33.290> of

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
so it's not that we are kind of

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.840 
so it's not that we are kind of
delivering<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.890> prescribed<00:00:34.340> body<00:00:34.670> of

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
delivering a prescribed body of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.450 
delivering a prescribed body of
knowledge<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.960> sort<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.380> set<00:00:36.590> packages<00:00:37.190> it's

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
knowledge in sort of set packages it's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.150 
knowledge in sort of set packages it's
rather<00:00:37.700> that<00:00:38.140> applicants<00:00:39.140> come<00:00:39.380> to<00:00:39.590> us<00:00:39.740> with<00:00:40.100> a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
rather that applicants come to us with a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.010 
rather that applicants come to us with a
particular<00:00:40.489> project<00:00:41.180> in<00:00:41.360> mind<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:41.900> they

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
particular project in mind that they

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.900 
particular project in mind that they
want<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.010> then<00:00:43.520> they<00:00:43.640> have<00:00:43.790> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
want to do and then they have the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.299 
want to do and then they have the
resources<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.690> University<00:00:45.410> both<00:00:46.100> in
