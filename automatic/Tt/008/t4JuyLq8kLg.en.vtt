we've brought a lot of new innovation
we've<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.180> brought<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> board<00:00:27.720> boot<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
we've really brought the board boot and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.529 
we've really brought the board boot and
bonding<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.859> an<00:00:29.400> equivalent<00:00:29.970> level<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
different ways of thinking and concepts

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
different ways of thinking and concepts
to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> product<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> market<00:00:43.079> basically

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to the product in the market basically

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490 
to the product in the market basically
we<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.969> whole<00:00:45.180> product<00:00:45.570> process

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we take like the whole product process

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
we take like the whole product process
from<00:00:46.649> start<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> beginning<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.000> start<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
from start the beginning so we start to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
from start the beginning so we start to
conceptualize<00:00:49.340> products<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.329> how

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
conceptualize products and like see how

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
conceptualize products and like see how
they<00:00:51.600> would<00:00:51.690> fit<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> lines<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
they would fit in the lines see what the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
they would fit in the lines see what the
consumer<00:00:53.820> might<00:00:54.059> want<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.199> then

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
consumer might want or need and then

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.099 
consumer might want or need and then
from<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> design

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
from there on we go like into the design

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.430 
from there on we go like into the design
process<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.949> sketching<00:00:59.550> CAD<00:01:00.449> designs<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
process with sketching CAD designs and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.980 
process with sketching CAD designs and
making<00:01:01.680> prototypes

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.420 

it's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.200> how<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.470> technology<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.280> can

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's not how much technology you can

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
it's not how much technology you can
ultimately<00:01:08.730> cram<00:01:09.120> into<00:01:09.360> something<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.170> how

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
ultimately cram into something it's how

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
ultimately cram into something it's how
simple<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.370> define<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.000> refine<00:01:12.330> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
simple you can define it and refine it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
simple you can define it and refine it
to<00:01:12.510> become<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.410> what<00:01:13.650> we've<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.010> been

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to become that's what we've really been

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
to become that's what we've really been
concentrating<00:01:14.730> on<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.910> year<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:15.660> our

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
concentrating on this year from our

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
concentrating on this year from our
graphics<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:17.010> our<00:01:17.400> boards<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.180> our<00:01:18.300> boots<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
graphics to our boards to our boots it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.720 
graphics to our boards to our boots it's
all<00:01:19.050> been<00:01:19.320> simplified<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> made<00:01:20.280> easier<00:01:20.580> for

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
all been simplified and made easier for

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:31.460 
all been simplified and made easier for
you<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.970> ride<00:01:29.479> slow<00:01:30.479> fuse<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> story<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you to go ride slow fuse and story is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
you to go ride slow fuse and story is
really<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.830> designing<00:01:32.400> products<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really about designing products that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
really about designing products that
work<00:01:33.780> better<00:01:34.050> together<00:01:34.350> both<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.460> an

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
work better together both for an

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
work better together both for an
engineering<00:01:36.479> part<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
engineering part but also like for the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
engineering part but also like for the
end<00:01:38.160> consumer<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.720> take<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
end consumer so they can take the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
end consumer so they can take the
guesswork<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.240> they<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
guesswork out of it and they get a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
guesswork out of it and they get a
better<00:01:42.690> product<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.440> better<00:01:43.590> day<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
better product for a better day on the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.540 
better product for a better day on the
hill

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
hill

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.240 
hill
so<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.360> an<00:01:45.450> example<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.140> incorporated<00:01:47.130> like

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so for an example we incorporated like

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.910 
so for an example we incorporated like
our<00:01:47.970> dampening<00:01:48.479> story<00:01:48.780> throughout<00:01:49.140> our<00:01:49.470> three

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
our dampening story throughout our three

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
our dampening story throughout our three
main<00:01:50.130> products<00:01:50.580> we<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.450> ABT<00:01:51.900> in<00:01:52.050> our

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
main products we have the ABT in our

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
main products we have the ABT in our

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the vibrations out of the board really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.290 
the vibrations out of the board really
like<00:01:58.680> gives<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> smooth<00:01:59.369> ride<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
like gives it a smooth ride so you can

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.150 
like gives it a smooth ride so you can
just<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> better<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.500> longer<00:02:01.860> day<00:02:02.009> on

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the hill you don't get those tired feet

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.230 
the hill you don't get those tired feet
from<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.100> board<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> chattering<00:02:05.759> or

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
from like your board is chattering or

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
from like your board is chattering or

the materials we use in our outsoles and
the<00:02:33.720> OC<00:02:34.049> coos<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.470> goes<00:02:34.650> into<00:02:34.830> outsoles

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the OC coos that goes into outsoles

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.490 
the OC coos that goes into outsoles
which<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.269> dampening<00:02:36.720> material<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
which is the dampening material that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
which is the dampening material that
really<00:02:37.709> works<00:02:38.040> well<00:02:38.280> also<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.269> cold

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
really works well also on a cold

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.660 
really works well also on a cold
temperature<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.400> any

products together it just works as a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.940 
products together it just works as a
system<00:02:53.690> that's<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.200> design<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.799> but

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the hill that it just works better

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.470
