00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 them my people how are we welcome 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 to football concert I am z 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.629
 welcome to this channel for football 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 but yes for fires and beasts and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.260
 welcome to a new remembering and there 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.420
 you have the man we are going to remember 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 today we what finidi george or george 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 finidi as it is known rather in 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 Spain is worth an extreme Nigerian youth 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.609
 right very very physically strong 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 see here how it will come but 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 also with quality when defining 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 when the first thing is to say george 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.590
 finidi looks at a single player character 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's say a character is worth it because the great 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.440
 part changes very very well always with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 your particular celebrations not with your 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.090
 way of watching football let's say you go to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 see later also how do you see many 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.210
 sometimes I had a hat prepared for 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.539
 when he scored goals in Betis that was 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 where I believe that all those who day 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.620
 today we know him especially in Spain 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.360
 obviously, we have more memories 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.309
 look how how to wear that hat 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.649
 we had ordered but prepared for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.379
 when he scored goal put him and celebrates 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.390
 of goal there you have that cool you have left 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.130
 the hat a very nice character 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 I already tell you that I fell general 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.180
 and well let's go to the purely sports 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.460
 because the typical African player is worth a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.040
 powerful strong African player with a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 huge stride is worth fixing here as 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.230
 it arrives earlier also always 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.760
 anticipated and then with quality 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.920
 definition care we leave here that 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.540
 seems to do and it is better that it can 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 it seems like maybe he hits the ball 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.570
 not very briefly premeditated 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.070
 forgiveness is worth it but yes that places it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.050
 perfectly well fix here as you 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 perfect tour good as you are seeing 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.200
 also the forest let's shut up 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 It was like seeing these people in Barcelona 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.830
 good lost the fish also sorry for 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.300
 The quality of the images is worth it 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.280
 it's a bit lazy to keep in mind that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.119
 this game played many years ago 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.830
 OK 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.229
 I have been because it has been what can 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.270
 find good to tell you a little bit 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.039
 he started playing from his country not in nigeria 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.289
 and they are a few years there in 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.899
 different teams what the ajax card 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.329
 Amsterdam is worth it then it forms a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.969
 amazing team together with link man and 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.560
 see no more or new clime imagine and 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.960
 well after several years that the already 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.209
 He is not very far there because he wins in the league and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.950
 others and after being three years old or 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.650
 doing it in the world doing it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 very very very well in the dutch league what 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.040
 fichan repeated football is worth this betis 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.410
 I think it all diabetics 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.329
 remember fondly with that alfonso 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 with robert jarni and later with denise 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.890
 They are with rosemary on the left side 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 a betis, so I'm there 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.849
 denilson just attending finidi 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.130
 as an betis who spent three years in the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.079
 uefa and that always was a team 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.430
 very showy at the time of playing and that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.410
 I'm particularly fond of him 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.910
 as you know on some occasion I said 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.010
 in this channel that I would like to make a 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 series talking about modest equipment 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.370
 let's say in quotes but have 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.900
 had great teams and they have 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.060
 delighted with his football as can be 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 for example the mostovoi celito litho 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.470
 fernandez or this destination or that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.840
 Cooper's valence 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.970
 and equipment of that nature or zaragoza de 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.340
 milÃ³sevic red car and others or the real 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.920
 of nihat for example and all of these topics 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.230
 to bring but good little by little like that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.350
 how are you going to take him again and how 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.540
 how it arrives perfectly and then defines 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.360
 what else can we say then that speed 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 physical and speed I think that then that 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 quality at the time of defining then 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.930
 did one is defined so much better 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.360
 dangerous on the right band tell you 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.180
 also because Beticism has you 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.930
 between one of your favorite players 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.110
 evidently he had nicknames like 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.820
 playful shadow or the vermilion gazelle 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.610
 do not look here as it looks like the eyebrow 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.830
 my mother who breaks it is that we wash it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.150
 the stowage and well I also have you 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.310
 true affection of finidi because I 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.080
 remember that era in which soccer 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.580
 Spanish was not so exaggerated the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.200
 difference that we had given to others not 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.400
 they would always make a team and I would stay 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.590
 this yes it is true that brand 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.060
 Barcelona clearly dominated but 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.220
 there was some subscribed and there was always 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.410
 some special equipment is worth that betis 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.239
 that mallorca-valencia is the sports one is 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.470
 athletic of madrid that they put that 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.950
 emotion to the league and that was 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.500
 and I have a lot of love for this 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.080
 era of the 90 for precisely that's why 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.380
 of other things and good people there you are 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.060
 seeing as he was always not a 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.850
 front forward good forgiveness deron 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.250
 end rather to score goals always 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.160
 at the first touch or go to death, not him 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.410
 I always had those meters of travel and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.910
 then since then simply define well 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.920
 that my people swim if you liked this 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.750
 video as you know I prefer to have 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.540
 things that I like about me things that are 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.950
 originals, not the typical ones that I know 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.130
 to sell that I know that everyone is going to 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.650
 see that I know they are commercial among 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.150
 quotes but I prefer to do this than 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.940
 wait what I like what I 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.320
 have fun with what I enjoy and in a certain 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.120
 way to try that you know 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.770
 different players is not always what 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.000
 same and what everyone else sells like this 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.980
 my people is nothing you liked the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.080
 video to like share it with the 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.490
 friends you know that these things help 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.320
 a lot for the channel to continue 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.940
 forward we are already almost 3,000 we are at 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.919
 point to get many thanks to 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.300
 all I say and always enjoy 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.600
