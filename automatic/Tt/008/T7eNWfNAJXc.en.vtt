00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.739

 A lot of grief because they have not

 toys and makes hospital gardens 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.860
 avoid for children to make 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.190
 your room 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.950

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 what hurts so much and everything is known and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.790

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.620
 have done these management you see this is the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.879
 another one that I have 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.989
 that this has been done by amelia bono the 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.989

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.610

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.890

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.709
 things come out all who win 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.540
 money with the sale of the dolls is 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.340
 for the organization of play therapy not 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.750

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.000
 we have to help people who 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.400
 they have cancer and there are poor people 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.890
 everything to the children the poor we are 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.099

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.470
 they are smaller there are some and me 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.239

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.890

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.890
