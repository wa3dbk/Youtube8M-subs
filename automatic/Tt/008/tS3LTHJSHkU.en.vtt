00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
levels of security the first level would

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.210 
levels of security the first level would
be<00:01:46.740> initially<00:01:47.740> when<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.920> go<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.189> website

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
then once you hit a camera there's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.940 
then once you hit a camera there's
another<00:01:52.479> level<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.020> security<00:01:53.439> where<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.830> have

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
another level of security where you have

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.039 
another level of security where you have

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
to have enter ID and password again once

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.660 
to have enter ID and password again once
again<00:01:56.140> for<00:01:56.560> each<00:01:56.679> different<00:01:56.890> camera<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.520> you

showing what caused the motion detection

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.800 
showing what caused the motion detection
to<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.799> off<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> then<00:02:45.820> secondly<00:02:46.239> what<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.630> does

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
to go off and then secondly what it does

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.770 
to go off and then secondly what it does
is<00:02:47.019> there's<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.440> SD<00:02:48.130> card<00:02:48.160> built<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.209> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
is there's a SD card built in so that it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.190 
is there's a SD card built in so that it
does<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.109> vent<00:02:50.709> recording<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.579> if<00:02:52.359> it<00:02:52.720> does<00:02:52.959> go

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
does a vent recording so if it does go

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140 
does a vent recording so if it does go
off<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.859> have<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.400> directory<00:02:55.000> of
