00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.449 
one I use for joints on tabletops you
can<00:03:30.110> get<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> good<00:03:30.410> look<00:03:30.470> at<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.980> plunges

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
can get a good look at that it plunges

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.580 
can get a good look at that it plunges
into<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.760> wood<00:03:31.970> like<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.750> allows<00:03:33.320> you

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
into the wood like that and allows you

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.699 
into the wood like that and allows you
to<00:03:33.740> use<00:03:34.420> these<00:03:35.420> biscuits<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:36.080> make<00:03:36.260> your<00:03:36.410> joint

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
to use these biscuits to make your joint

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.170 
to use these biscuits to make your joint
and<00:03:36.950> when<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:37.160> add<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> little<00:03:37.580> glue<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.910> these

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and when you add a little glue to these

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.240 
and when you add a little glue to these
biscuits<00:03:38.450> they<00:03:39.410> plump<00:03:39.709> up<00:03:39.800> pretty<00:03:39.980> good<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
biscuits they plump up pretty good and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.340 
biscuits they plump up pretty good and
make<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> fairly<00:03:41.150> strong<00:03:41.420> mechanical<00:03:42.080> joint

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
make a fairly strong mechanical joint

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.479 
make a fairly strong mechanical joint
okay<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.670> then<00:03:43.820> the<00:03:44.000> jigsaw<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:45.709> jigsaw<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.459> a

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
okay and then the jigsaw the jigsaw is a

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.460 
okay and then the jigsaw the jigsaw is a
good<00:03:46.760> one<00:03:46.940> in<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.690> allows<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.260> cut

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
good one in that it allows you to cut

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.190 
good one in that it allows you to cut
curves<00:03:48.830> very<00:03:49.040> easily<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:50.450> expensive<00:03:51.020> route

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
curves very easily the expensive route

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.949 
curves very easily the expensive route
you<00:03:51.350> can<00:03:51.470> take<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.220> see<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.610> home<00:03:52.959> bandsaw

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
you can take and see that home bandsaw

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.229 
you can take and see that home bandsaw
will<00:03:54.110> do<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> same<00:03:54.470> thing<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:55.430> little<00:03:55.790> more<00:03:56.060> for

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
will do the same thing a little more for

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.880 
will do the same thing a little more for
that<00:03:56.360> finesse<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.080> will<00:03:57.350> actually<00:03:57.470> let<00:03:57.739> you

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
that finesse and will actually let you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.300 
that finesse and will actually let you
do<00:03:58.040> more<00:03:58.459> types<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.970> cuts<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.570> bigger<00:03:59.750> stock

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
do more types of cuts to a bigger stock

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.040 
do more types of cuts to a bigger stock
the<00:04:01.310> jig<00:04:01.580> saw<00:04:01.790> though<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> lot<00:04:02.330> cheaper<00:04:02.390> so

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
the jig saw though is a lot cheaper so

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.229 
the jig saw though is a lot cheaper so
this<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:03.440> another<00:04:03.709> tool<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.430> can<00:04:04.910> get<00:04:05.090> for

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
this is another tool you can get for

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.790 
this is another tool you can get for
around<00:04:05.330> seventy-five<00:04:05.930> bucks<00:04:06.110> for<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.440> decent

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
around seventy-five bucks for a decent

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.040 
around seventy-five bucks for a decent
model<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.520> again<00:04:07.760> as<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.239> furniture<00:04:08.750> builder

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
model and again as a furniture builder

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.080 
model and again as a furniture builder
I'm<00:04:09.200> doing<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.560> lot<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:09.800> curved<00:04:10.340> pieces<00:04:10.850> and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
I'm doing a lot of curved pieces and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.420 
I'm doing a lot of curved pieces and
this<00:04:11.510> allows<00:04:11.870> me<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.170> cut<00:04:12.770> those<00:04:12.950> curves<00:04:13.250> out

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
this allows me to cut those curves out

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.370 
this allows me to cut those curves out
pretty<00:04:13.670> easily<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.360> now<00:04:14.720> we've<00:04:14.959> gotten<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
pretty easily so now we've gotten the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.500 
pretty easily so now we've gotten the
big<00:04:15.590> power<00:04:16.280> tools<00:04:16.520> out<00:04:16.760> of<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.910> way<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.120> wanted
