00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.110
 the last time we had come to discover the first montage 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.109
 modules 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 and this time we are 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.009
 we see a little the same second 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.119
 these cuts of the walls of windows 1 and especially 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.109
 powerfully empower the builder for the establishment of mcdonald's isola 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.510
 a certain 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 all alone blue 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 we have thus gone from a possible doubling 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.080
 so we chose two small tenths 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.100
 two of the most successful than those especially play the most ecological 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.190
 all there was in the wood fiber 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.750
 so that's 5 post 100% ecological and then he was praying the hallway a scree 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 the walls are twenty centimeters thick, with layers against 30 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 we will allow to have years 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.940
 good insulation 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.290
 in the saddle for the balance and for the ceilings 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.410
 when we chose the ump 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.780
 cellulose wadding 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 this year is easily the corridors of very nice coefficient 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.870
 thermal every hand she's going to be finally filled by two layers of 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:15.960
 wood wool 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.760
 against crossed they will have excellent insulation 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.860
 but I'm all reporting a vapor barrier this year a career 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 which starts protecting this insulation 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.420
 lity of the interior of the house 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.720
 and on the bottom and on the outside does not miss leaving what is still called 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.000
 more 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.750
 will protect the wood from anything that is related to the election external moisture
