Ian<00:02:22.050> displays<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.769> very<00:02:23.069> little<00:02:23.280> power<00:02:23.610> so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
Ian displays it's very little power so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.759 
Ian displays it's very little power so
just<00:02:24.180> kind<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> adds<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.110> different<00:02:25.409> level<00:02:25.530> of

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
just kind of adds a different level of

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.430 
just kind of adds a different level of
versatility<00:02:26.250> into<00:02:27.209> your<00:02:27.450> into<00:02:28.019> your<00:02:28.049> usage

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
versatility into your into your usage

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.100 
versatility into your into your usage
scenario<00:02:28.950> with<00:02:29.940> your<00:02:30.120> devices<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:30.900> there's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
scenario with your devices now there's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.229 
scenario with your devices now there's
another<00:02:31.409> cool<00:02:31.709> feature<00:02:31.890> they<00:02:32.129> have<00:02:32.340> here<00:02:32.670> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
another cool feature they have here and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.140 
another cool feature they have here and
that's<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.690> translate<00:02:34.849> translate<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
that's what the translate translate and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.460 
that's what the translate translate and
he's<00:02:39.299> gonna<00:02:39.450> poke<00:02:39.690> some<00:02:39.870> stuff<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.319> back

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
he's gonna poke some stuff on the back

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.740 
he's gonna poke some stuff on the back
pulling<00:02:40.920> up<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:41.700> screen<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
pulling up the right right screen and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.330 
pulling up the right right screen and
then<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.110> me<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.349> boom<00:02:43.620> there<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:47.010> this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
then to me like boom there it is so this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
then to me like boom there it is so this
is<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:48.000> division<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.510> Intel<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:48.989> it's<00:02:49.170> looking

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
is the division of Intel as it's looking

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.339 
is the division of Intel as it's looking
at<00:02:49.700> forward-thinking

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
at forward-thinking

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.690 
at forward-thinking
concepts<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.530> ideas<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.310> use<00:02:53.519> with

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
concepts and ideas that we can use with

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.740 
concepts and ideas that we can use with
our<00:02:53.730> portable<00:02:54.120> devices<00:02:54.410> I'm<00:02:55.410> always<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.860> fan<00:02:56.010> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
our portable devices I'm always a fan of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.460 
our portable devices I'm always a fan of
different<00:02:57.750> ways<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.049> we<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.290> actually

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
different ways that we can actually

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.280 
different ways that we can actually
interact<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.099> our<00:02:59.340> tech<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.109> just<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
interact with our tech so this is just a

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.229 
interact with our tech so this is just a
quick<00:03:01.560> look<00:03:01.739> at<00:03:01.950> an<00:03:02.069> e-ink<00:03:02.519> display<00:03:02.970> built

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
quick look at an e-ink display built

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.300 
quick look at an e-ink display built
into<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> top<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.049> an<00:03:04.140> octopus<00:03:04.590> people<00:03:05.220> it's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
into the top of an octopus people it's
