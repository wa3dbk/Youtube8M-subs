00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with my phyllo now phyllo is quite a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.010 
with my phyllo now phyllo is quite a
delicate<00:00:48.960> pastry<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.149> good<00:00:51.329> though<00:00:51.570> do

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
delicate pastry just so good though do

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.010 
delicate pastry just so good though do
you<00:00:52.079> ever<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> yourself<00:00:52.559> ah<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:54.270> haven't

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you ever make it yourself ah I haven't

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
you ever make it yourself ah I haven't
personally<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:57.090> it's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
personally actually but I think it's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
personally actually but I think it's
much<00:00:57.329> better<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.690> buy<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.379> very

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
much better to buy it I think it's very

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.459 
much better to buy it I think it's very
hard<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> actually<00:00:59.579> rap<00:01:00.510> sing<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> thin

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
hard to actually rap sing out that thin

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.160 
hard to actually rap sing out that thin
so<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> want<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:04.250> squares<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.750> cut

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so I want this in squares you know cut

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.880 
so I want this in squares you know cut
that<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.720> cut<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> down

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.800 

and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.880> butter<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:16.380> lightly

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
and then with my butter just lightly

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.040 
and then with my butter just lightly
guessing<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:20.480> so<00:01:21.480> we're<00:01:21.600> layering<00:01:21.810> them

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
guessing that so we're layering them

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.540 
guessing that so we're layering them
over<00:01:22.320> each<00:01:22.380> other<00:01:22.620> yeah<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.370> it<00:01:23.430> doesn't

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
over each other yeah and it doesn't

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.950 
over each other yeah and it doesn't
matter<00:01:23.730> if<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.120> perfect<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.870> then

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
matter if it's not perfect you can then

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
matter if it's not perfect you can then
cut<00:01:25.230> them<00:01:25.470> afterwards<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.370> you<00:01:26.490> basically

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cut them afterwards but you basically

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.970 
cut them afterwards but you basically
just<00:01:26.940> want<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> double<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.660> so<00:01:28.050> it's<00:01:28.440> thick<00:01:28.800> and

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
just want to double up so it's thick and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.219 
just want to double up so it's thick and
it<00:01:29.040> will<00:01:29.130> actually<00:01:29.280> hold<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> do

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it will actually hold you have to do

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
it will actually hold you have to do
this<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.470> few<00:01:31.890> times<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:35.420> think<00:01:36.420> I've<00:01:36.510> got<00:01:36.660> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this a few times I think I've got this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
this a few times I think I've got this
under<00:01:36.990> control<00:01:37.280> but<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> haven't<00:01:38.520> shown<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
under control but I haven't shown you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.820 
under control but I haven't shown you
what<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.270> after<00:01:39.720> you've<00:01:39.840> led<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.290> ok<00:01:40.800> so

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
what to do after you've led them ok so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.280 
what to do after you've led them ok so
then<00:01:41.160> we've<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> nice<00:01:41.760> sort<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.290> thickness

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
then we've got a nice sort of thickness

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
then we've got a nice sort of thickness
I<00:01:43.710> mean<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.250> look<00:01:44.340> quite<00:01:44.520> rustic<00:01:45.000> that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I mean they can look quite rustic that's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.640
