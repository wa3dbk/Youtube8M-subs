4.1<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.670> are<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> be<00:00:05.970> learning<00:00:06.120> how

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
4.1 and we are going to be learning how

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.179 
4.1 and we are going to be learning how
to<00:00:06.359> make<00:00:06.480> runic<00:00:06.930> armor<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:07.859> first<00:00:08.069> you're

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
to make runic armor so first you're

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.919 
to make runic armor so first you're
gonna<00:00:08.280> need<00:00:08.490> some<00:00:08.700> scribing<00:00:09.030> tools<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.389> some

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
gonna need some scribing tools and some

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.169 
gonna need some scribing tools and some
paper<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.130> those<00:00:11.250> two<00:00:11.309> come<00:00:11.849> into<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
paper so with those two come into the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.030 
paper so with those two come into the
form<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.480> omok<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> click<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> runic

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
form an omok on and click on the runic

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.700 
form an omok on and click on the runic
armor<00:00:14.429> tab<00:00:15.230> once<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> clicked<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.650> that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
armor tab once you clicked on that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.080 
armor tab once you clicked on that
you'll<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> research<00:00:17.490> name<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:17.850> it

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
you'll get the research name for it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.970 
you'll get the research name for it
then<00:00:18.390> stick<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> scribing<00:00:19.830> tools

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
then stick that and the scribing tools

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.200 
then stick that and the scribing tools
back<00:00:20.220> into<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.869> research<00:00:21.869> table<00:00:22.580> then<00:00:23.580> as

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
back into your research table then as

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.720 
back into your research table then as
you<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.779> we've<00:00:25.050> got<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.980> armor<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you see here we've got the armor the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.170 
you see here we've got the armor the
brain

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
brain

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.650 
brain
padishah<00:00:27.810> pre-k<00:00:28.650> show<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> air<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> join

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
padishah pre-k show and air so to join

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.950 
padishah pre-k show and air so to join
these<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> ok<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.790> join<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
these we have to ok so to join the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.430 
these we have to ok so to join the
shield<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.880> armor<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> brain<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:37.260> go

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
shield the armor to the brain we go

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310 
shield the armor to the brain we go
through<00:00:37.739> each<00:00:37.980> tremendum<00:00:39.110> instrumentum<00:00:40.110> then

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
through each tremendum instrumentum then

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770 
through each tremendum instrumentum then
goes<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.530> humanness<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.750> humanness<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
goes through humanness and humanness and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.580 
goes through humanness and humanness and
go<00:00:43.050> directly<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> brain<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> if

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
go directly to the brain like that so if

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.690 
go directly to the brain like that so if
you<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.860> took<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> humanness<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> way

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you just took a humanness in the way

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.180 
you just took a humanness in the way
there<00:00:48.110> okay<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.010> we'll

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
there okay so what we do now is we'll

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.709 
there okay so what we do now is we'll
connect<00:00:50.460> pre-k<00:00:50.789> CO<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> potentially

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
connect pre-k CO and potentially

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.420 
connect pre-k CO and potentially
together<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.649> literally<00:00:52.920> directly

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
together so they are literally directly

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
together so they are literally directly
connected<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.940> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
connected like this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.939 
connected like this
just<00:00:56.070> stick<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> those<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.719> way<00:00:57.870> like

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.299 

that<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.120> air<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.750> connect<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> 4<00:01:04.890> K<00:01:05.040> Co

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that and then air can connect to 4 K Co

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.539 
that and then air can connect to 4 K Co
fruit<00:01:06.119> Wharram<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.070> then<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.159> directly

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
fruit Wharram and then they directly

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.210 
fruit Wharram and then they directly
connect<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> stick<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> tempest

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
connect like this if we stick a tempest

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.899 
connect like this if we stick a tempest
us<00:01:14.720> there<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.640> I've<00:01:17.790> run

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
us there and there just because I've run

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.510 
us there and there just because I've run
out<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.390> other<00:01:18.720> aspects<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.890 

connect<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.049> connect<00:01:28.439> Prakash<00:01:28.860> EO<00:01:29.900> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
connect so we can connect Prakash EO to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.249 
connect so we can connect Prakash EO to
the<00:01:31.799> brain<00:01:32.009> through<00:01:32.729> vacuous<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.990> let's<00:01:34.110> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the brain through vacuous so let's just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.160 
the brain through vacuous so let's just
make<00:01:34.380> some<00:01:34.409> vacuous<00:01:34.890> quickly<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:39.960> fact

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
make some vacuous quickly so in fact

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
make some vacuous quickly so in fact
your<00:01:40.350> scan<00:01:40.560> goes<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:42.090> vacuous

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
your scan goes there and then vacuous

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
your scan goes there and then vacuous
can<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> vacuous<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> /<00:01:46.200> D<00:01:47.189> Shh<00:01:48.060> /

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
can go to so vacuous can go to / D Shh /

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.200 
can go to so vacuous can go to / D Shh /
d<00:01:48.810> show<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:50.220> /<00:01:50.759> d<00:01:51.119> co<00:01:51.390> connects<00:01:52.049> Shh

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
d show and then / d co connects Shh

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.569 
d show and then / d co connects Shh
great

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
great

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.980 
great
-<00:01:57.259> mortis<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:59.369> this<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> bit<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
- mortis and this one there's a bit of a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
- mortis and this one there's a bit of a
complicated<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.040> go<00:02:02.189> finally

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
complicated one but there we go finally

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
complicated one but there we go finally
done<00:02:02.850> runic<00:02:03.270> armor<00:02:03.719> awesome

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
done runic armor awesome

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
done runic armor awesome
so<00:02:05.130> we'll<00:02:05.280> take<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> research<00:02:06.719> table

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
so we'll take out the research table

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.380 
so we'll take out the research table
then<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.770> click<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.190> you'll<00:02:08.489> discover

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
then right click it and you'll discover

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
then right click it and you'll discover
the<00:02:09.720> research

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the research

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.149 
the research
so<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.810> research<00:02:13.110> protective<00:02:13.620> magics<00:02:14.040> have

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
so your research protective magics have

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.759 
so your research protective magics have
led<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> let<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.750> discover<00:02:16.049> runic<00:02:16.409> armor

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
led to let you to discover runic armor

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.680 
led to let you to discover runic armor
so<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> basically<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.060> next<00:02:18.209> step<00:02:18.450> up

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so this is basically the next step up

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.979 
so this is basically the next step up
from<00:02:19.349> what<00:02:19.500> we've<00:02:19.650> already<00:02:19.799> got

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
from what we've already got

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.160

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
slightly improved if I use an arena

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.229 
slightly improved if I use an arena
