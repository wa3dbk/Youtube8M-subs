00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.840 

Sally<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> truck<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.430> she's<00:02:18.700> in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
Sally in the truck this and she's in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.450 
Sally in the truck this and she's in
trouble<00:02:19.000> like<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.930> can<00:02:20.380> our<00:02:20.560> winch<00:02:20.920> hold<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
trouble like you can our winch hold the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.570 
trouble like you can our winch hold the
weight<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.850> two-ton<00:02:22.030> truck<00:02:22.950> James<00:02:23.950> let's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
weight of the two-ton truck James let's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.280 
weight of the two-ton truck James let's
see<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:24.970> two<00:02:25.240> thousand<00:02:25.720> pounds<00:02:26.020> divided

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
see that's two thousand pounds divided

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.530 
see that's two thousand pounds divided
by<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> wind<00:02:26.890> resistance<00:02:27.520> times<00:02:27.790> two<00:02:28.270> slope

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
by the wind resistance times two slope

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:41.560 
by the wind resistance times two slope
