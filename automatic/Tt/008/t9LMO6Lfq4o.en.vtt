got a half living right in and flip out
and<00:00:15.500> you'll<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> switch<00:00:16.890> that's<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> key

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
to a spot and work on darkslides I just

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.390 
to a spot and work on darkslides I just
check<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> slide<00:00:24.830> just<00:00:25.830> cave<00:00:26.070> minute

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
check out the slide just cave minute

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
check out the slide just cave minute
like<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> feel<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.779> how<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> slides

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
like that get a feel for how it slides

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
like that get a feel for how it slides
and<00:00:28.439> pops<00:00:28.619> off<00:00:28.820> that's<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> funnest

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
and pops off that's like the funnest

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.339 
and pops off that's like the funnest
part<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.840> doing<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> whole<00:00:31.140> bunch<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
part is just doing a whole bunch of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.479 
part is just doing a whole bunch of
cave-ins<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.769> should<00:00:31.920> always<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> bunch<00:00:32.430> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
cave-ins you should always do a bunch of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.360 
cave-ins you should always do a bunch of
or<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:32.969> try<00:00:33.149> hopping<00:00:33.690> into<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.250> once<00:00:35.250> you're

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
or even try hopping into it once you're

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.250 
or even try hopping into it once you're
into<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:36.090> long<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.870> hop<00:00:37.050> out

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
into it as long as you got the hop out

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
into it as long as you got the hop out
right<00:00:37.500> you're<00:00:38.309> good<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:39.660> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
right you're good to go so the way it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
right you're good to go so the way it
works<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> regular<00:00:40.980> kickflip

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
works it's not like a regular kickflip

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
works it's not like a regular kickflip
which<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.360> always<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.780> bit<00:00:42.989> weird<00:00:43.260> make

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
which is always a little bit weird make

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.139 
which is always a little bit weird make
sure<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.309> stand<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.670> toes<00:00:44.879> too

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
sure you don't stand on your toes too

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
sure you don't stand on your toes too
much<00:00:45.329> front<00:00:45.840> foot<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.350> sure<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.710> pushed

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
much front foot make sure it's pushed

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520 
much front foot make sure it's pushed
down<00:00:47.160> along<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.520> rail<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.320> do

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
down along with rail a bit like that do

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
down along with rail a bit like that do
not<00:00:49.680> stand<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.640> always<00:00:50.789> bad

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
not stand like that that's always bad

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.810 
not stand like that that's always bad
policy<00:00:51.649> once<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> all<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.550> just

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
policy once you all in it's just

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.400 
policy once you all in it's just
basically<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> kickflip<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
basically a kickflip but what kind of

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
basically a kickflip but what kind of
sucked<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.129> gotta<00:00:56.699> push<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sucked about it gotta push it up a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
sucked about it gotta push it up a
little<00:00:57.719> bit<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> fun<00:00:58.199> types<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> motion<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
little bit of a fun types of motion and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040 
little bit of a fun types of motion and
the<00:00:59.850> strange<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.390> getting<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.840> feet

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the strange thing is getting your feet

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.529 
the strange thing is getting your feet
out<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> said<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.280> awkward

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
out there I said it could be so awkward

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.509 
out there I said it could be so awkward
once<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> land<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.229> goal<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:05.040> try<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
once you land the goal is really try to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
once you land the goal is really try to
get<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> aboard<00:01:06.090> towards<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> back<00:01:06.900> truck

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
get you aboard towards the back truck

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
get you aboard towards the back truck
because<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> middle<00:01:08.460> you're<00:01:08.760> both

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
because it's in the middle you're both

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
because it's in the middle you're both
flexing<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.229> tends<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> stop<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
flexing a lot and it tends to stop you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.960 
flexing a lot and it tends to stop you
and<00:01:11.430> talk<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
and talk to you so you think you do is

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.609 
and talk to you so you think you do is
always<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.689> hard<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> pop<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
always it's really hard to pop out if it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.640 
always it's really hard to pop out if it
puts<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> side<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> deck<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.470> your

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
puts on the side of the deck but if your

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
puts on the side of the deck but if your
ball<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.130> foots<00:01:20.340> kind<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.850> edge<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
ball your foots kind of on this edge the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020 
ball your foots kind of on this edge the
way<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> works<00:01:22.170> once<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:22.920> sliding<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
way it works once you're sliding you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
way it works once you're sliding you
kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> curl<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> scoop<00:01:25.290> scoop<00:01:25.710> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
kind of curl it you scoop scoop your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
kind of curl it you scoop scoop your
toes<00:01:26.040> over<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.909> does<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> pulls

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
toes over and what it does is it pulls

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
toes over and what it does is it pulls
the<00:01:27.869> board<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:29.460> bump<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the board like this just bump it out of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
the board like this just bump it out of
the<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.299> let<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> sec<00:01:31.770> then

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the way let it go with it for a sec then

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.789 
the way let it go with it for a sec then
pull<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> learn

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
pull it back and then you just learn

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
pull it back and then you just learn
stretch<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> whole<00:01:36.750> key<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> them

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
stretch so that's the whole key to them

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.249 
stretch so that's the whole key to them
is<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.500> whole<00:01:38.270> curling<00:01:39.270> motion<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
is that whole curling motion with the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
is that whole curling motion with the
back<00:01:40.470> foot<00:01:40.650> rook<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> hanging
