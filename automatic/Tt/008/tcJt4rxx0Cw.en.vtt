signal indicators in the brake lamps in

the<00:02:09.160> past<00:02:09.429> CD<00:02:10.000> s<00:02:10.179> we<00:02:10.660> did<00:02:10.840> not<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.400> LEDs<00:02:12.400> in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
the past CD s we did not have LEDs in

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.850 
the past CD s we did not have LEDs in
the<00:02:12.640> back<00:02:12.820> we<00:02:13.060> had<00:02:13.260> incandescent<00:02:14.260> lamps<00:02:14.770> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the back we had incandescent lamps in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.130 
the back we had incandescent lamps in
the<00:02:14.950> back<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.880> also<00:02:15.910> use<00:02:16.360> an<00:02:16.510> LED<00:02:16.660> for<00:02:17.050> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the back we also use an LED for the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.440 
the back we also use an LED for the
backup<00:02:17.530> lamp<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> rear<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> car<00:02:18.940> the

backup lamp in the rear of the car the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.390 
backup lamp in the rear of the car the
front<00:02:19.600> lamps<00:02:20.020> we<00:02:20.200> use<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.500> same<00:02:20.709> idea<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:21.310> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
front lamps we use the same idea of a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.270 
front lamps we use the same idea of a
light<00:02:21.610> pipe<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.840> projects<00:02:23.410> light<00:02:23.770> from<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
light pipe that projects light from the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.370 
light pipe that projects light from the
from<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.030> bottom<00:02:25.450> all<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.870> way<00:02:25.989> up<00:02:26.140> through

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
from the bottom all the way up through

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.580 
from the bottom all the way up through
again<00:02:26.860> gives<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.370> razor-sharp<00:02:28.320> look<00:02:29.320> to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
again gives a very razor-sharp look to

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.100 
again gives a very razor-sharp look to
the<00:02:29.709> front<00:02:30.040> light<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.520> night<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.209> then<00:02:31.959> we

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the front light at night and then we

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.910 
the front light at night and then we
have<00:02:32.640> an<00:02:33.640> adaptive<00:02:33.940> front<00:02:34.600> light<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:35.530> turns

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
have an adaptive front light which turns

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.699 
have an adaptive front light which turns
15<00:02:36.880> degrees<00:02:37.209> outboard<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:37.989> five<00:02:38.290> degrees

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
15 degrees outboard or five degrees

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.949 
15 degrees outboard or five degrees
inboard<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.730> conjunction<00:02:40.269> with<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.690> steering

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
inboard in conjunction with the steering

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.990 
inboard in conjunction with the steering
of<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.230> car<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.769> as<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.040> go<00:02:42.280> around<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.760> corner

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
of the car so as you go around a corner

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.750 
of the car so as you go around a corner
your<00:02:43.690> lights<00:02:43.959> will<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.500> follow<00:02:44.769> around

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
your lights will actually follow around

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.210 
your lights will actually follow around
the<00:02:45.970> corner<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.590> remain<00:02:47.890> straight

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
the corner and not just remain straight

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.310 
the corner and not just remain straight
ahead<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.820> it's<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.030> very<00:02:49.239> nice<00:02:49.390> feature<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
ahead so it's a very nice feature and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.930 
ahead so it's a very nice feature and
actually<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.709> safety<00:02:51.070> feature<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.549> well<00:02:51.700> and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
actually a safety feature as well and

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.449 
actually a safety feature as well and
you<00:02:52.120> look<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.600> light<00:02:52.840> pipes<00:02:53.170> as<00:02:53.799> well<00:02:53.860> as

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
you look at the light pipes as well as

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.600 
you look at the light pipes as well as
these<00:02:55.450> hyper<00:02:55.780> vision<00:02:56.200> bulbs<00:02:56.560> that's<00:02:57.130> really

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
these hyper vision bulbs that's really

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.390 
these hyper vision bulbs that's really
what<00:02:57.760> separates<00:02:58.180> these<00:02:58.510> from<00:02:58.840> most<00:02:59.049> of<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
what separates these from most of the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.160 
what separates these from most of the
headlamps<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.700> street<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.989> is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
headlamps on the street in that this is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.690 
headlamps on the street in that this is
the<00:03:02.290> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.560> stuff<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.830> see<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.040> show<00:03:03.430> cars

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
the kind of stuff you see on show cars
