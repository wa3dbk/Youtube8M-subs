00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
slightly different route i believe i'm

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.090 
slightly different route i believe i'm
still<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:35.009> through<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.060> hanger<00:01:36.509> here

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
still gonna go through the hanger here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
still gonna go through the hanger here
but<00:01:38.210> i'm<00:01:39.210> gonna<00:01:39.329> switch<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.869> switch<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.560> up
