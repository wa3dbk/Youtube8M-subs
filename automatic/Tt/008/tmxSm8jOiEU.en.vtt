00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.840 
he said basically don't go there because
really<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.800> would<00:02:21.130> have<00:02:21.250> lost<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.640> much<00:02:21.790> blood

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
really you would have lost so much blood

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.550 
really you would have lost so much blood
and<00:02:22.300> then<00:02:22.420> passed<00:02:22.660> out<00:02:22.870> euro<00:02:23.170> started

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and then passed out euro started

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.530 
and then passed out euro started
swallowing<00:02:23.770> Aryan<00:02:24.130> blood<00:02:24.330> effectively<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
swallowing Aryan blood effectively and

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420 
swallowing Aryan blood effectively and
then<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.260> worst<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.010> worst<00:02:27.040> thing<00:02:27.340> is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
then the worst the worst thing is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.280 
then the worst the worst thing is
obviously<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.090> pass<00:02:28.360> away<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:28.690> no<00:02:28.959> unknown

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
obviously you pass away with no unknown

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.480 
obviously you pass away with no unknown
basically<00:02:29.920> that's<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.160> could<00:02:30.400> have

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
basically that's what could have

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.590 
basically that's what could have
happened<00:02:31.680> Henry<00:02:32.680> certainly<00:02:33.550> saved<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.450> whole

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
happened Henry certainly saved the whole

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.320 
happened Henry certainly saved the whole
family<00:02:35.020> really
