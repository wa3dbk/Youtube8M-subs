00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
attitude I believe as TLO starts let's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
attitude I believe as TLO starts let's
go<00:01:37.590> scouting<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.400> his<00:01:38.880> own<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.069 
just going on here right now just kind
of<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.579> through<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.939> initial<00:01:57.299> points<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
of going through the initial points of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.740 
of going through the initial points of
the<00:01:58.259> map<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.399> doing<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.149> spawning<00:02:00.570> pool

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the map here doing that spawning pool

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
the map here doing that spawning pool
going<00:02:00.990> down<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> extractor<00:02:02.700> going

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
going down to have that extractor going

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
going down to have that extractor going
down<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.540> probably<00:02:03.780> will<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.350> metabolic

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
down so we probably will see metabolic

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.670 
down so we probably will see metabolic
boost<00:02:05.399> coming<00:02:05.759> down<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.180> those<00:02:06.390> zerglings<00:02:06.960> in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
boost coming down for those zerglings in

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.309 
boost coming down for those zerglings in
the<00:02:07.829> speedlings<00:02:08.840> halfway<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the speedlings halfway down on that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
the speedlings halfway down on that
hatchery<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> nice<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.640> meet<00:02:11.849> up

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
hatchery we do see a nice little meet up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.280 
hatchery we do see a nice little meet up
here<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> center<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> map

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
here in the center of the map

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.160 
here in the center of the map
we<00:02:13.469> we<00:02:13.980> start<00:02:14.250> moving<00:02:14.370> around<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:17.840> TLO<00:02:18.840> also

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
we we start moving around and TLO also

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.330 
we we start moving around and TLO also
getting<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.469> command<00:02:19.769> center<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.250> an

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
getting that command center up to an

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.979 
getting that command center up to an
orbital<00:02:20.579> command<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.359> that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
orbital command going to get that that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.839 
orbital command going to get that that
extra<00:02:22.590> money<00:02:22.709> coming<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.519> soon<00:02:23.730> as

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
extra money coming in as soon as

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.550 
extra money coming in as soon as
possible<00:02:24.420> yeah<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:24.900> bringing<00:02:25.439> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
possible yeah there we go bringing that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.250 
possible yeah there we go bringing that
down<00:02:26.420> do<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.480> see<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.689> Mago<00:02:27.930> bring<00:02:28.109> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
down do you see the Mago bring that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.800 
down do you see the Mago bring that
