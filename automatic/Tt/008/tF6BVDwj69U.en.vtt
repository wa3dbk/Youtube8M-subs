00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.089 
um u part wig and also a closure so it's
the<00:02:17.739> comb<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> lot<00:02:18.489> harder<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.090> use<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:20.099> this

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
the comb is a lot harder to use if this

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.770 
the comb is a lot harder to use if this
was<00:02:21.819> my<00:02:22.060> hair<00:02:22.389> stuck<00:02:22.749> to<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:23.019> head

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
was my hair stuck to my head

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.080 
was my hair stuck to my head
the<00:02:23.990> comb<00:02:24.200> would<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> lot<00:02:24.830> easier<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.640> go

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the comb would be a lot easier to go

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.790 
the comb would be a lot easier to go
through<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:26.930> what<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.140> mean<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.590> like

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
through you know what I mean it's like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.720 
through you know what I mean it's like
taking<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:29.260> brush<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:30.740> going<00:02:31.220> through<00:02:31.550> it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
taking a brush and just going through it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.390 
taking a brush and just going through it
it<00:02:31.940> would<00:02:32.060> be<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.240> lot<00:02:32.480> easier<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.830> because

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
it would be a lot easier but because

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.520 
it would be a lot easier but because
that<00:02:34.430> wasn't<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.000> case<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.660> felt<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> lot

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that wasn't the case I felt like a lot

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.590 
that wasn't the case I felt like a lot
of<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> product<00:02:37.190> state<00:02:37.430> into<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.940> brush<00:02:38.240> and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
of the product state into the brush and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.559 
of the product state into the brush and
not<00:02:39.380> enough<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.400> hair<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.239> see<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
not enough on the hair so if you see the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.540 
not enough on the hair so if you see the
video<00:02:41.720> am<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.020> trying<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.650> string<00:02:43.430> it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
video am I trying to like string it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.070 
video am I trying to like string it
through<00:02:43.580> then<00:02:44.150> after<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.930> said

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
through then after that I just said

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
it but then I went in with my comb I

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.150 
it but then I went in with my comb I
went<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.630> with<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.380> cone<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.950> this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
went in with just a cone like this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
went in with just a cone like this
actually<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.820> back<00:02:56.000> home<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.570> I<00:02:56.989> just

actually this is back home and I just

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.900 
actually this is back home and I just
like<00:02:57.440> raked<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.100> through<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.519> what<00:02:58.670> not<00:02:58.880> just

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
like raked it through and what not just

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.080

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
because I wanted it to have a good

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.460 
because I wanted it to have a good
gradient<00:03:02.600> effect<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.350> also<00:03:03.590> um<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:05.470> didn't

like<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.709> wanted<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.220> like

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
like that I just wanted it to like

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.840 
like that I just wanted it to like
dissolve<00:03:14.090> or<00:03:14.800> like<00:03:15.800> transition<00:03:16.489> into<00:03:16.640> the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
dissolve or like transition into the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270 
dissolve or like transition into the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
thinking about it but I'm pretty sure I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.449 
thinking about it but I'm pretty sure I
left<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.810> between<00:03:33.430> 25<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.459> 35<00:03:35.239> minutes<00:03:35.780> um

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
left it in between 25 to 35 minutes um

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.460 
left it in between 25 to 35 minutes um
once<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.640> saw<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.910> color<00:03:38.329> that<00:03:39.019> was<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.350> you
