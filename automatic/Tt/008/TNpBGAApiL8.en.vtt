00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
horizontally a center channel which

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910 
horizontally a center channel which
usually<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.340> an<00:01:02.460> MT<00:01:02.760> M<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.409> mt<00:01:04.409> m<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> mid

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
usually is an MT M or a mt m with a mid

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.230 
usually is an MT M or a mt m with a mid
range<00:01:05.100> below<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> they're<00:01:06.000> usually

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
range below of which is they're usually

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
range below of which is they're usually
the<00:01:06.570> preferred<00:01:06.740> speaker<00:01:07.740> choice<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the preferred speaker choice because it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.969 
the preferred speaker choice because it
gives<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> better<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:09.090> access<00:01:09.600> performance

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so in those situations I would recommend

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
so in those situations I would recommend
that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> center<00:01:14.490> channel<00:01:14.880> as

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

close to the screen as you can usually
below<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> screen<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.840> it

screens<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> could<00:01:39.420> put<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.659> three

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
screens and then you could put all three

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.170 
screens and then you could put all three
speakers<00:01:40.290> behind<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.860> screen<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.970> could

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
speakers behind the screen that could

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.130 
speakers behind the screen that could
work<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.570> well<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.590> tend<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.850> more

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
work really well I tend to be more

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
work really well I tend to be more
gravitate<00:01:46.140> towards<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.310> seeing<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.670> front

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
gravitate towards I like seeing my front

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
gravitate towards I like seeing my front
speakers<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.899> especially<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.350> they're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
speakers I like especially if they're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
speakers I like especially if they're
towers<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.189> don't<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.119> having<00:01:51.329> any

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
towers I don't like having any

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
towers I don't like having any
interference<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> screen<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:52.950> any<00:01:53.070> off

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
interference with a screen or any off

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
interference with a screen or any off
access<00:01:53.700> anomalies<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.229> doing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
access anomalies but if you're doing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.139 
access anomalies but if you're doing
mostly<00:01:55.770> movie<00:01:56.250> watching<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.939> you're<00:01:57.030> not

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
mostly movie watching and you're not

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
mostly movie watching and you're not
doing<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.509> whole<00:01:57.689> lot<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.990> music<00:01:58.439> listening

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
doing a whole lot of music listening

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.700 
doing a whole lot of music listening
then<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> great<00:02:00.509> solution<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:01.290> most

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
then that is a great solution for most

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
then that is a great solution for most
people<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> could<00:02:02.790> put<00:02:02.969> even

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
people and then you could put even

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.670 
people and then you could put even
bigger<00:02:03.450> speakers<00:02:03.899> behind<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> screen<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bigger speakers behind a screen and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.010 
bigger speakers behind a screen and
never<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:05.040> them<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> got<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> good

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
never see them so you got to get a good

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
never see them so you got to get a good
screen<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.649> Seymour<00:02:08.129> has<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> good

them on the floor either yeah you know

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.860 
them on the floor either yeah you know
it's<00:02:31.579> like<00:02:31.730> how<00:02:31.879> many<00:02:31.970> people<00:02:32.269> we've<00:02:32.599> seen<00:02:32.840> a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
it's like how many people we've seen a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's like how many people we've seen a
week<00:02:33.109> of<00:02:33.370> video<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.459> literally<00:02:34.939> put<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.299> on

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
on the floor and then wondering why they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.420 
on the floor and then wondering why they
can't<00:02:41.689> hear<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.590> no<00:02:42.709> they<00:02:42.829> can't<00:02:43.010> hear<00:02:43.159> liam
