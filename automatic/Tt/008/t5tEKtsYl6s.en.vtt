YouTube so yeah and that is pretty cool
so<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.480> thought<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.170> looks<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so I just thought that it looks like a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.139 
so I just thought that it looks like a
really<00:01:01.710> great<00:01:01.920> brush<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.309> work<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.850> liquid

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
really great brush to work with a liquid

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.509 
really great brush to work with a liquid
because<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:04.920> BB<00:01:05.339> cream

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
because I like in my BB cream

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
because I like in my BB cream
Cena<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.240> work<00:01:06.689> foundational

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
Cena so I don't really work foundational

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960 
Cena so I don't really work foundational
what<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.490> thought<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.939> be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
what so I just thought this would be

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.460 
what so I just thought this would be
really<00:01:09.210> great<00:01:09.450> brush<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.260> was

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really great brush and I think this was

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.730 
really great brush and I think this was
around<00:01:10.799> 12<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> 11<00:01:12.299> pounds<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:13.380> i<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
around 12 to 11 pounds which i think is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
around 12 to 11 pounds which i think is
really<00:01:13.950> great<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.270> good<00:01:15.479> quality

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
really great for a really good quality

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
really great for a really good quality
brush<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:16.950> excited<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.430> pick
