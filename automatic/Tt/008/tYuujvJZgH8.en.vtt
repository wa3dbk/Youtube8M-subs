00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
for a four piece of paper I think I'd

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
for a four piece of paper I think I'd
like<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> few<00:02:25.140> maybe<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.220> centimeter<00:02:26.880> from

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
like a few maybe like a centimeter from

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.070 
like a few maybe like a centimeter from
the<00:02:27.810> edge<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:29.300> because<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.900> like

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the edge but in because you get like

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
the edge but in because you get like
maybe<00:02:31.320> five<00:02:31.800> pieces<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.430> cancer<00:02:32.760> vapor<00:02:33.030> per

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
maybe five pieces of cancer vapor per

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.770 
maybe five pieces of cancer vapor per
pocket

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
pocket

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.550 
pocket
I'd<00:02:34.170> recommend<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.860> testing<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.580> first<00:02:35.910> so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
I'd recommend like testing out first so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.009 
I'd recommend like testing out first so
once<00:02:37.560> you've<00:02:37.709> got<00:02:37.830> your<00:02:37.860> perfect<00:02:38.810> picture<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
once you've got your perfect picture and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.320 
once you've got your perfect picture and
your<00:02:40.170> perfect<00:02:41.540> nice

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
your perfect nice

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.600 
your perfect nice
and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.500> go<00:02:45.830> ahead<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.100> print<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
and you can go ahead and print it on the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.670 
and you can go ahead and print it on the
transfer<00:02:46.970> paper<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.960> instructions<00:02:48.470> will<00:02:48.650> be

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
transfer paper the instructions will be

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
transfer paper the instructions will be
on<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:50.120> should<00:02:50.330> be<00:02:50.450> somewhere<00:02:50.960> in<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
on the it should be somewhere in the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.910 
on the it should be somewhere in the
packet<00:02:51.760> for<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.410> basically<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.770> get

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
packet for that so basically you get

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.750 
packet for that so basically you get
your<00:02:55.070> t-shirt<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:57.070> desmos<00:02:58.070> demonstration

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
your t-shirt and desmos demonstration

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.510 
your t-shirt and desmos demonstration
this<00:02:59.120> was<00:02:59.300> my<00:02:59.510> middle<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.950> iron<00:03:01.310> on

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
this was my middle and you iron on

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.510 
this was my middle and you iron on
transfer<00:03:02.120> paper<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.250> first<00:03:04.250> for<00:03:04.460> the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
transfer paper and I think first for the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.610 
transfer paper and I think first for the
best<00:03:04.700> results<00:03:05.210> I<00:03:05.270> made<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> five<00:03:06.050> seconds<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
best results I made a five seconds of a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.220 
best results I made a five seconds of a
band<00:03:06.830> t-shirt<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.870> didn't<00:03:09.110> like

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
band t-shirt and I didn't like

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.050 
band t-shirt and I didn't like
completely<00:03:09.770> cut<00:03:10.040> around<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.460> edge<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.970> was

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
completely cut around the edge so it was

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.910 
completely cut around the edge so it was
kind<00:03:11.300> of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.589 

stiff<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.220> it's<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:16.240> couldn't<00:03:16.480> really

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
stiff but it's like you couldn't really

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.900 
stiff but it's like you couldn't really
move<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.959> around<00:03:17.050> it<00:03:17.290> was<00:03:17.380> like<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.700> wasn't

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
move it around it was like it wasn't

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.410 
move it around it was like it wasn't
good

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
good

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.559 
good
so<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.200> recommend<00:03:20.770> cutting<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.550> right<00:03:22.300> to<00:03:22.480> the

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
so I recommend cutting it right to the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.260 
so I recommend cutting it right to the
edge<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.050> image<00:03:23.489> before<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.640> INF<00:03:25.060> by<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
edge of the image before you INF by the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.290 
edge of the image before you INF by the
ways<00:03:25.480> before<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.110> iron<00:03:26.670> see<00:03:27.670> they're<00:03:27.849> like<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
ways before you iron see they're like I

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.500 
ways before you iron see they're like I
cut<00:03:28.930> right<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> black<00:03:30.220> line<00:03:30.510> it's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
cut right up to the black line it's

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.630 
cut right up to the black line it's
still<00:03:31.750> fabric<00:03:32.110> wet<00:03:32.319> inside<00:03:32.950> probably<00:03:33.250> have<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
still fabric wet inside probably have a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.820 
still fabric wet inside probably have a
difference<00:03:33.970> actually<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.959> still<00:03:35.290> kind<00:03:35.770> of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
difference actually it still kind of

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.949 
difference actually it still kind of
want<00:03:35.920> them<00:03:36.069> a<00:03:36.239> transfer<00:03:37.239> material

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.050 

and<00:03:40.739> that's<00:03:40.890> basically<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.760> then<00:03:41.909> you

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
and that's basically it and then you

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.830 
and that's basically it and then you
just<00:03:42.269> wait<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.659> to<00:03:42.719> I<00:03:43.549> guess<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:45.599> do<00:03:45.719> this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
just wait for it to I guess you do this

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.599 
just wait for it to I guess you do this
any<00:03:46.109> which<00:03:46.409> you<00:03:46.500> want<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:46.980> said<00:03:47.189> I<00:03:47.400> made<00:03:47.579> a

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609
