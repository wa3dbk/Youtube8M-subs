00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
so you're probably wondering all right

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.520 
so you're probably wondering all right
well<00:01:31.460> which<00:01:32.060> looks<00:01:32.299> like<00:01:32.509> kind<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.439> a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
well which looks like kind of like a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.350 
well which looks like kind of like a
luxury<00:01:33.950> car<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:34.520> probably<00:01:34.789> not<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.000> fast

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
luxury car it's probably not that fast

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
luxury car it's probably not that fast
it<00:01:35.750> looks<00:01:35.930> really<00:01:36.079> heavy<00:01:36.350> well<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.310> heavy

it looks really heavy well it is a heavy
car<00:01:37.789> but<00:01:38.719> that<00:01:38.869> means<00:01:38.899> it's<00:01:39.469> more<00:01:39.710> sturdy<00:01:40.039> on

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
car but that means it's more sturdy on

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.990 
car but that means it's more sturdy on
the<00:01:40.310> road<00:01:40.520> at<00:01:40.700> high<00:01:40.729> speeds<00:01:42.610> what<00:01:43.610> do<00:01:43.700> they<00:01:43.759> put

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the road at high speeds what do they put

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.410 
the road at high speeds what do they put
in<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.179> thing<00:01:44.360> well<00:01:45.880> has<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:46.909> 4-liter<00:01:47.780> v8<00:01:48.110> and

in this thing well has a 4-liter v8 and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.330 
in this thing well has a 4-liter v8 and
then<00:01:50.420> since<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.079> our<00:01:51.380> model<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
then since this is the our model the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.010 
then since this is the our model the
racing<00:01:52.729> model<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.960> supercharged<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
racing model it's supercharged so the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.529 
racing model it's supercharged so the
four<00:01:57.530> liter<00:01:57.740> v8<00:01:58.069> by<00:01:58.250> itself<00:01:58.579> makes<00:01:58.880> 300

four liter v8 by itself makes 300

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.179 
four liter v8 by itself makes 300
horsepower<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.200> supercharger<00:02:00.860> adds<00:02:01.039> an

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
horsepower the supercharger adds an

extra 70 making this car total at 370
horsepower<00:02:05.979> which<00:02:06.979> means<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:08.630> pretty<00:02:08.869> fast

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
horsepower which means it's pretty fast

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:19.630 
horsepower which means it's pretty fast
very<00:02:11.299> very<00:02:11.930> fast<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:15.670> 2001<00:02:17.410> jack<00:02:18.640> x

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
very very fast so that's it 2001 jack x

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.039 
very very fast so that's it 2001 jack x
jr<00:02:21.040> what's<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.250> can't<00:02:23.239> see<00:02:23.420> anything<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.989> the
