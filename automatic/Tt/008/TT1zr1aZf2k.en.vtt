here<00:05:10.569> cuz<00:05:11.169> they<00:05:11.319> use<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.710> inside<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.340> their

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
here cuz they use this inside of their

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.640 
here cuz they use this inside of their
antlers<00:05:12.819> to<00:05:12.939> rub<00:05:13.150> up<00:05:13.300> on<00:05:13.449> trees<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:16.560> kind<00:05:17.560> of
