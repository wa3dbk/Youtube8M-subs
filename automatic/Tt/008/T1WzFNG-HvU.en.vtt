00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.170
 ah 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello everyone and welcome to adif am 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.439
 patrick to the point was professor of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.890
 add and specifically teacher of this 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.890
 course 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.070
 in this first week we are going to talk about 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.110
 the city ​​and the organism this is a subject 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 introductory that we are very interested in 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.410
 introduce yourself because you are going to make a 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.660
 history of urbanism that as such is 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.059
 interesting for those people who 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.180
 have not known urbanism 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.059
 academically but for those who already 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.220
 have notions of it they will see how 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.420
 it's a subject that has a bit of focus 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.510
 different in which reference is made 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 from now on to urban sustainability 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.530
 this issue of this unit has a series 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.759
 of points first is an introduction to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 the concepts of urbanism and 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.450
 planning 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.730
 we will see the differences between these two 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 concepts 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.770
 then we will talk about the shelter and the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.030
 settlement and the evolution of the concept 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.160
 of city here we want to refer to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.570
 let's say the germ or the origin of 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.640
 cities since from before having 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 written testimonies that is from the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.860
 prehistory and good we a series of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.950
 concepts 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.820
 and related to the differences between 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.340
 the shelter on the one hand the settlement 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.580
 the settlement that is adopted 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.690
 consciously and the birth of 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.870
 cities 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.590
 more or less voluntarily or 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.590
 aware 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.039
 next we will make a series of 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.039
 considerations regarding the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.700
 morphology of the cities to the election 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.270
 of the best enclaves 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.800
 to these cities that are going to have a lot 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.390
 importance also from the point of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.270
 view of sustainability since 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.810
 in origin and nowadays going back to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.550
 the issue of sustainability we need 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.610
 know the best 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.450
 and better physical characteristics in the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.450
 that you can sit 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.320
 point 14 regarding the start of the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.160
 planning will show those cities 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.110
 that have been since ancient times 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.840
 planned from the famous 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.230
 the plan of and we can of mileto for your 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.769
 city 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.860
 the roman camps the colonies of 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:08.870
 Latin America many centuries later and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.760
 another set of issues relating to 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.989
 plus the ordination of the territory in this 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.100
 case that the organism like that 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.890
 medieval repopulation operations 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.930
 well from there we will talk already in 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.420
 point 15 of other examples of 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.060
 cities do not have new cities 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.480
 created 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.260
 not in the modern age but already in times 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.040
 as old as I am in high age 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.370
 middle in the Visigothic era 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.079
 in the Spain Muslim Spain in the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.599
 growth of cities is very 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.450
 important interventions in the 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.620
 existing city 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.480
 It is practically more important than 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.330
 examples of new cities since 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.220
 all cities have an origin 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.940
 cities that we know in their immense 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.610
 Most are the result of a process of 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.530
 transformation and expansion very 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.010
 step by step I have not made a bang 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.560
 therefore we will see interventions that 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.890
 age from middle age 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.209
 modern 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.090
 some more known cases and with 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.530
 proper names urban forms of 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.610
 london and paris that we will put as 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.039
 example and then we will see already 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.009
 this gives us the next point that 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.870
 it's the renewal proposals it's about 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:34.650
 of proposals 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.850
 much more ambitious at the end of the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.610
 modern age already at the time 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.260
 contemporary almost in those who 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.060
 the big cities 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.100
 of the western world 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.800
 and undergoes a transformation by 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.669
 industrial revolution and they need a 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.700
 very ambitious approach of 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.990
 expansion or renewal we will see in the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.969
 case of spain- example is very 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.939
 interesting is that they have given rise 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.219
 we are listed in the history of 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.599
 world body 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:11.590
 in their own right as are the 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.420
 Spanish extensions 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.110
 well as the city the line of 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.490
 story height and then other examples 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.230
 the European majority is like cities 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.530
 yard 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:27.210
 or Latin Americans as the new 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.100
 cities of which 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.819
 the most famous is the new capital of 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.260
 brasilia and others that are all over the 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.930
 world 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.510
 to finish the topic we will give a 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.970
 basic bibliography that will help you 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.970
 expand information on this topic
