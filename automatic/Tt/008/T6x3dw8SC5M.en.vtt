prom these spot prawn these areas that
we<00:00:06.720> had<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.930> come<00:00:07.080> back<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.350> work<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.910> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
we had to come back and work on the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.970 
we had to come back and work on the
wheel<00:00:09.059> arch<00:00:09.330> even<00:00:10.230> after<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.500> showed<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:10.830> last

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
wheel arch even after I showed you last

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.160 
wheel arch even after I showed you last
night<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:12.090> back<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> hand<00:00:12.900> fill

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
night going back of it with a hand fill

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
night going back of it with a hand fill
it<00:00:13.860> still<00:00:14.580> had<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> little<00:00:15.089> bit<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.330> funkiness

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
it still had a little bit of funkiness

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.050 
it still had a little bit of funkiness
to<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.470> worked<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.859> down<00:00:17.460> there<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
to it so we worked on it down there and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.550 
to it so we worked on it down there and
a<00:00:18.449> couple<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.840> areas<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.380> maybe

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a couple more areas and so I think maybe

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500 
a couple more areas and so I think maybe
that's<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.250> weren't<00:00:23.430> doing<00:00:23.609> before<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that's what we weren't doing before you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.970 
that's what we weren't doing before you
know<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.109> walk<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.740> primer

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
know if we just walk it out with primer

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.000 
know if we just walk it out with primer
but<00:00:26.330> you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.420> our<00:00:27.869> block<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.529> God

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
but you know our block it out with God

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.550 
but you know our block it out with God
coat<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.640> still<00:00:29.910> had<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:30.960> waviness<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
coat but it still had some waviness to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.590 
coat but it still had some waviness to
it<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.890> we've<00:00:32.669> tweaked<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.480> we're

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it so we've tweaked it in I think we're

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.520 
it so we've tweaked it in I think we're
good<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.420> got<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.630> nice<00:00:37.320> little

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
good to go there and got a nice little

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.150 
good to go there and got a nice little
pile<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> primer<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:39.510> sweep<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:43.160> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pile of primer to sweep up there and so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
pile of primer to sweep up there and so
we're<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.700> spot<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.989> wheel<00:00:46.170> arch

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
we're going to spot from that wheel arch

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.920 
we're going to spot from that wheel arch
over<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.010> area<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> door<00:00:47.930> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
over there this area on the door a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.889 
over there this area on the door a
couple<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> funky<00:00:49.800> spots<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.120> then

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
couple of funky spots there and then

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
couple of funky spots there and then
this<00:00:52.050> fender<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.129> both<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this fender and both of these have had a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
this fender and both of these have had a
lot<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.510> done<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
lot of work done to them and so it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.060 
lot of work done to them and so it's
getting<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:57.539> body<00:00:58.440> Lionel<00:00:58.770> defender

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.640 
hob bill we're out of the matrix so we
have<00:02:02.540> some<00:02:03.770> Omni<00:02:04.770> stuff<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.310> had<00:02:05.399> left<00:02:05.640> over

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
have some Omni stuff we had left over

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.460 
have some Omni stuff we had left over
it's<00:02:07.580> not<00:02:07.790> as<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> hob<00:02:08.540> build<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.020> doesn't<00:02:09.290> build

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
it's not as a hob build it doesn't build

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.230 
it's not as a hob build it doesn't build
near<00:02:09.710> as<00:02:09.860> high<00:02:10.040> as<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.430> matrix<00:02:10.790> does<00:02:11.000> but<00:02:11.210> I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
near as high as the matrix does but I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.260 
near as high as the matrix does but I
think<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.540> sounds<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.930> lot<00:02:12.020> easier<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.180> we'll<00:02:14.180> be

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
think it sounds a lot easier so we'll be

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.550 
think it sounds a lot easier so we'll be
putting<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.110> little<00:02:15.320> bit<00:02:15.440> of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
putting that on and it's a little bit of

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.290 
putting that on and it's a little bit of
a<00:02:15.680> funky<00:02:16.220> looking<00:02:16.340> color<00:02:16.700> kind<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> brown

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
a funky looking color kind of a brown

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.230 
a funky looking color kind of a brown
but<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.230> what<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.500> little<00:02:19.190> big<00:02:19.280> deal<00:02:19.460> all

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
but it is what it is little big deal all

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.220 
but it is what it is little big deal all

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.750 
primer and this body line and spot here
really<00:02:34.700> turned<00:02:34.910> out<00:02:35.090> good<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:36.440> area<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:36.950> don't

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
really turned out good this area I don't

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.480 
really turned out good this area I don't
know<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.620> million<00:02:40.040> times<00:02:40.070> better

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
know it's like a million times better

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.050 
know it's like a million times better
but<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> still<00:02:41.240> got<00:02:41.420> some<00:02:41.630> funkiness<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:43.060> so

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
but it still got some funkiness to it so

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.290 
but it still got some funkiness to it so
we'll<00:02:44.480> see<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.900> may<00:02:45.740> give<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.730> some<00:02:46.970> more<00:02:47.000> work

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
we'll see I may give it some more work

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.040 
we'll see I may give it some more work
or<00:02:47.570> i<00:02:47.600> may<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:47.810> let<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.320> ride<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.930> i

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
or i may just let it ride and like i

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.860 
or i may just let it ride and like i
said<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.060> million<00:02:53.390> times<00:02:53.630> better

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
said it's it's a million times better

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.199 
said it's it's a million times better
than<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.200> was<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.740> there's<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.070> little<00:02:55.340> run<00:02:56.030> i

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
here was a really rough and not very

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.110 
here was a really rough and not very
straight<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.769> it's<00:03:13.459> nice<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.700> straight<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
straight so it's nice and straight to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.729 
straight so it's nice and straight to
them<00:03:14.510> down<00:03:14.690> there<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.959> was<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.080> little<00:03:15.320> funky<00:03:15.650> as

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
them down there it was a little funky as

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.270 
them down there it was a little funky as
well<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:17.530> looks<00:03:18.530> pretty<00:03:18.709> good<00:03:18.830> now<00:03:18.890> we'll<00:03:19.040> see

well so looks pretty good now we'll see
how<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.459> blocks<00:03:19.760> out<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.269> wait<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> couple
