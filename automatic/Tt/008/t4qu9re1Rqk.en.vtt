there over wheel drive if you look in

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.540 
there over wheel drive if you look in
the<00:00:47.190> top<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> screen<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.930> see

the top right of the screen you can see

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.630 
the top right of the screen you can see
that<00:00:51.320> what<00:00:52.320> horsepower<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> earlier<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that what horsepower is that earlier in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.439 
that what horsepower is that earlier in
top<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> screen<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
top right at the screen you can see the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.590 
top right at the screen you can see the
two<00:00:57.870> back<00:00:58.500> wheels<00:00:58.820> they're<00:00:59.820> highlighted

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
two back wheels they're highlighted

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
two back wheels they're highlighted
black<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.710> that's<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> case<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
black so if that's the case then it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
black so if that's the case then it
means<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.390> rear-wheel<00:01:03.600> drive<00:01:03.860> which<00:01:04.860> means

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
means it's rear-wheel drive which means

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520 
means it's rear-wheel drive which means
it<00:01:05.610> can't<00:01:05.909> drift<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.900> drift<00:01:07.110> all-wheel

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530

picking them so I just just chose a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.830 
picking them so I just just chose a
random<00:02:22.300> wheel<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.510> coming<00:02:25.750> for

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
random wheel I think so you coming for

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
random wheel I think so you coming for
that<00:02:25.930> engine<00:02:26.670> well<00:02:27.670> I'd<00:02:27.760> recommend<00:02:27.910> first<00:02:28.480> be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that engine well I'd recommend first be

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.340 
that engine well I'd recommend first be
honest<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.750> platform<00:02:32.050> of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
honest is to go on to a platform of

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.440 
honest is to go on to a platform of
handling<00:02:32.680> put<00:02:33.489> everything<00:02:33.940> race<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.530> race

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
handling put everything race so race

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.840 
handling put everything race so race
everything<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.350> then<00:02:38.560> go<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.980> drivetrain<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
everything and then go to drivetrain and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.520 
everything and then go to drivetrain and
race<00:02:40.360> everything<00:02:40.930> again

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
race everything again

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.670 
race everything again
and<00:02:42.180> aspiration<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.360> saw<00:02:43.959> turbocharged<00:02:44.920> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and aspiration I saw turbocharged it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.820 
and aspiration I saw turbocharged it
always<00:02:47.680> need<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> turbo<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.959> engine<00:02:50.730> basically

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
always need a turbo and engine basically

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.280 
always need a turbo and engine basically
with<00:02:53.830> your<00:02:54.070> power<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.600> want<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.170> in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
with your power you just want to get in

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.460 
with your power you just want to get in
between<00:02:56.519> 600<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.610> 650<00:02:58.030> brake<00:02:58.660> horsepower<00:02:59.170> I'd

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
between 600 and 650 brake horsepower I'd

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.350 
between 600 and 650 brake horsepower I'd
say<00:02:59.739> that<00:02:59.920> works<00:03:00.160> really<00:03:00.489> nice<00:03:00.790> on<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.150> game

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
say that works really nice on this game

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680 
say that works really nice on this game
I<00:03:01.680> say<00:03:02.680> any<00:03:02.950> less<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.459> struggles<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.510> their

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
gear for to get the power and any more

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.770 
gear for to get the power and any more
than<00:03:08.530> you're<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.910> struggle<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.570> any

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
go to drift better like without any grip

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.960 
go to drift better like without any grip
but<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:17.950> bit<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.310> group<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.760> I'll
