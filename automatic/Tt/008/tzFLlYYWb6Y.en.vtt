00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
could kind of look in the I don't know

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.390 
could kind of look in the I don't know
if<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:54.480> too<00:03:54.660> dark<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.230> see<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
if it's too dark for you to see but the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.979

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
actually in the top of the box up here I

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.580 
actually in the top of the box up here I
don't<00:04:04.739> think<00:04:04.890> there's<00:04:05.040> any<00:04:05.220> light<00:04:05.459> right<00:04:06.090> now

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
don't think there's any light right now

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.400 
don't think there's any light right now

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
but anyway let's pull the computer out

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.800 
but anyway let's pull the computer out
get<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:11.390> packing<00:04:12.390> trash<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:13.049> my<00:04:13.140> way

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
get this packing trash out of my way

I've<00:06:03.710> taken<00:06:04.370> out<00:06:04.550> these<00:06:05.150> stuff<00:06:05.449> and<00:06:05.780> put<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:05.960> in

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
I've taken out these stuff and put it in

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.689 
I've taken out these stuff and put it in
a<00:06:06.199> little<00:06:06.260> pile<00:06:06.590> there<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:07.010> didn't<00:06:07.669> realize

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
a little pile there I didn't realize

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.879 
a little pile there I didn't realize
this<00:06:08.090> because<00:06:08.389> I<00:06:08.449> am<00:06:08.660> retarded<00:06:08.960> but<00:06:09.320> actually

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
this because I am retarded but actually

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.950 
this because I am retarded but actually
the<00:06:10.460> tabs<00:06:10.850> because<00:06:11.389> I<00:06:11.449> was<00:06:11.479> wondering<00:06:11.840> how<00:06:11.930> I

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the tabs because I was wondering how I

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.120 
the tabs because I was wondering how I
was<00:06:11.990> going<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.229> get<00:06:12.350> this<00:06:12.470> computer<00:06:12.889> out<00:06:13.010> of

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
was going to get this computer out of

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.750 
was going to get this computer out of
here<00:06:13.250> the<00:06:14.150> tabs<00:06:14.449> actually<00:06:15.280> you<00:06:16.280> can<00:06:16.430> see<00:06:16.610> this

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
here the tabs actually you can see this

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.650 
here the tabs actually you can see this
lifts<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.979> box<00:06:22.220> completely<00:06:22.880> off<00:06:23.060> the<00:06:24.340> bottom

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
lifts the box completely off the bottom

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.879 
lifts the box completely off the bottom
so<00:06:26.660> apparently<00:06:26.930> you<00:06:27.260> don't<00:06:27.350> actually<00:06:27.590> have<00:06:27.770> to

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
so apparently you don't actually have to

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.090 
so apparently you don't actually have to
pick<00:06:28.160> up<00:06:28.340> the<00:06:29.020> what<00:06:30.020> is<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:30.260> like<00:06:30.350> 40<00:06:30.800> pound

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
pick up the what is it like 40 pound

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.900 
pick up the what is it like 40 pound
computer<00:06:31.669> that<00:06:32.120> they<00:06:32.300> send<00:06:32.570> you<00:06:33.470> can<00:06:33.910> tell

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
computer that they send you can tell

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.629 
computer that they send you can tell
it's<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.360> metal<00:06:35.900> so<00:06:36.110> it's<00:06:36.289> pretty<00:06:36.639> pretty

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
it's it metal so it's pretty pretty

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:45.390 
it's it metal so it's pretty pretty
heavy<00:06:39.400> got<00:06:40.400> some<00:06:41.650> tape<00:06:42.650> up<00:06:42.860> here<00:06:43.099> on<00:06:43.220> the<00:06:43.310> front

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
heavy got some tape up here on the front

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.240 
heavy got some tape up here on the front
put<00:06:46.400> tape<00:06:46.700> on<00:06:46.820> my<00:06:46.970> computer<00:06:49.150> rid<00:06:50.150> of<00:06:50.270> this<00:06:50.330> tape

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
put tape on my computer rid of this tape

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.430 
put tape on my computer rid of this tape
so<00:06:52.250> let's<00:06:52.849> see<00:06:53.150> if<00:06:53.419> I<00:06:53.570> can<00:06:53.599> and<00:06:54.080> get<00:06:54.200> a<00:06:54.229> better

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
so let's see if I can and get a better

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.500 
so let's see if I can and get a better
view<00:06:54.710> here<00:06:55.479> here<00:06:56.479> is<00:06:56.690> the<00:06:56.900> front<00:06:57.280> of<00:06:58.510> the

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
view here here is the front of the

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:07.240 
view here here is the front of the
computer<00:07:02.949> here<00:07:03.949> is<00:07:04.130> the<00:07:04.729> side<00:07:04.970> I<00:07:05.889> know<00:07:06.889> it's

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
computer here is the side I know it's

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.189 
computer here is the side I know it's
probably<00:07:07.610> really<00:07:08.270> dark<00:07:08.599> and<00:07:08.750> you<00:07:08.870> can't<00:07:09.080> see

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
probably really dark and you can't see

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.089 
probably really dark and you can't see
