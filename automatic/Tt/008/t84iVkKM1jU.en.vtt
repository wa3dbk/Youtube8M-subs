00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 great lovers of computers at the microphone he 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.140
 punk today want to help and on the advice 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.690
 build a pretty powerful gaming pc 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 worth about 42 thousand rubles 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 which will be easy to pull gta 5 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.490
 battlefield 4 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 dying light world of tanks ks16 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.949
 and all sorts of other games on high and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.490
 maximum settings resolution 1920 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.180
 at 1080 pixels you are interested then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.180
 go 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.470
 let's start right away with the processor i advise 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.250
 take the processor from intel 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.410
 namely intel core i5 3570k frequency and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 3.4 gigahertz 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.870
 it can be found in the region of 14-17 thousand 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.750
 rubles and 5507 skay 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.670
 This is a top processor 2012 which 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.830
 still pulls most games on 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.650
 maximum settings even without overclocking 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.570
 why intel because intel 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.040
 less heated which allows you to overclock 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.440
 it is much more without good 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.790
 cooling than a similar processor 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.070
 company ppm 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.750
 and by the way this processor is open 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.850
 multiplier so its much easier 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.759
 straighten than the same processor without 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.040
 prefix ok now go straight to 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.810
 chilling our questions in this to you 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.000
 help CPU cooler 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.460
 company deepcool million deepcool gammaxx 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.030
 200t hurt a decent cooler for its 600 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.400
 rubles 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.720
 thanks to the radiator tubes of this 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.520
 the cooler is enough for us to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.890
 overclock our processor to good 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.770
 frequencies further goes the most important 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.360
 component for gaming performance 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.610
 We take a good graphics card 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.370
 price-quality solutions from nvidia geforce 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080
 gtx 960 version from asus 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.700
 this card is the most powerful of its 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 fellow from other companies 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 it has the highest core frequency and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.360
 the memory is already that they are only two gigabytes 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.020
 entering memory but it is very beautiful 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.180
 looks like 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.340
 And besides, you can turn on the backlight 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.640
 cards in the video experience program 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.830
 This vidyaha worth 13,000 rubles now 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 smoothly go to the RAM 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.030
 here we take a rather expensive decision from 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.360
 kingston's company called kingston 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.340
 &amp; chips 318i as the frequency of this memory 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.720
 will allow to somehow compensate for 2 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 gigabytes of video memory 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.890
 RAM cost 3 thousand rubles 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.590
 now we take pretty good 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.750
 motherboard from asus which 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.610
 will let us use all our power 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
 ram track in this 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.450
 motherboard memory frequency supported 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.519
 up to 2 1200 megahertz 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.980
 also about the RAM, I took one 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.290
 a bar size of 8 gigabytes since 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.510
 Our motherboard only has two slots 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 for RAM and we in the future 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.070
 save on upgrade cost 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.620
 motherboard starts from 3000 rubles 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.640
 hard disk capacity of 1 terabyte we 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.560
 set from the company 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.330
 western digital as it is 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.100
 Cheap and reliable hard drive not 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.620
 all our games fit 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.319
 cost information keepers 3600 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.660
 rubles go to the power supply takes 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.610
 manufacturers called vtyk on 650 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.440
 watt as it is enough for overclocking and 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.100
 subsequent upgrade cost starts 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.380
 3000 rubles now take the case I 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.060
 I propose a solution from the company chord it 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.000
 cheapest with quality cases 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.800
 all our components into it and fit it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.050
 the price is 1100 rubles and now the most important thing 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.480
 this flash drive will fit any flash drive 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.550
 size of 16 gigabytes and Th us 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.700
 install windows or not drive 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.269
 flash drives cost starts from 250 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.400
 rubles 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.810
 I hope my video was for you 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.670
 useful and interesting 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.700
