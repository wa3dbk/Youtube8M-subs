00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
don't get any sort of sunlight so I look

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.570 
don't get any sort of sunlight so I look
pasty<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.110> look<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.890> no<00:01:08.189> sort<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
pasty and I look like I have no sort of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.390 
pasty and I look like I have no sort of
like<00:01:09.260> definition<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.380> anything<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
like definition or anything on me so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
like definition or anything on me so
that<00:01:11.640> sounds<00:01:12.030> exactly<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.780> well<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> reason

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that sounds exactly like well the reason

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
why I draw all over myself is because I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
why I draw all over myself is because I
never<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> chance<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.650> work<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> sit

putting my best foot forward that's the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.910 
putting my best foot forward that's the
reason<00:03:36.760> why<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.269> wear<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.440> type<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.769> makeup
