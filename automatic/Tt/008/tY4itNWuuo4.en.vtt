okay<00:04:28.620> let<00:04:29.220> me<00:04:29.310> start<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:29.670> measure<00:04:29.940> let's<00:04:30.540> do

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
okay let me start this measure let's do

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.390 
okay let me start this measure let's do
the<00:04:30.870> left<00:04:30.990> hand<00:04:31.230> first<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:32.730> with<00:04:33.150> five<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.720> one

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the left hand first a a with five to one

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.640 
the left hand first a a with five to one
was<00:04:35.400> our<00:04:35.550> procedure<00:04:36.270> me<00:04:36.690> back<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.470> c-sharp

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
was our procedure me back to c-sharp

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.880 
was our procedure me back to c-sharp
down<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.430> dandy<00:04:38.670> so<00:04:40.850> go<00:04:41.850> by<00:04:42.120> two<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.690> two<00:04:43.110> one<00:04:43.500> two

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
down a dandy so go by two on two one two

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.420 
down a dandy so go by two on two one two
three<00:04:44.400> five<00:04:45.260> on<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.470> one<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:47.040> right<00:04:47.220> hand

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
three five on that one the right hand

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.540 
three five on that one the right hand
has<00:04:47.610> D<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.240> E<00:04:48.360> together<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.710> then<00:04:49.980> C<00:04:50.220> sharp

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
has D and E together and then C sharp

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.540 
has D and E together and then C sharp
and<00:04:50.670> E<00:04:50.790> together<00:04:51.830> okay<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:52.890> if<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.160> start<00:04:53.430> right

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
and E together okay so if I start right

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.490 
and E together okay so if I start right
here<00:04:53.910> let<00:04:54.390> me<00:04:54.420> put<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.660> ear<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.110> before

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
here let me put that ear I before

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.570 
here let me put that ear I before
because<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.740> really<00:04:55.950> goes<00:04:56.040> around<00:04:56.250> before

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.559 

yeah

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.930 

you

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
you

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:17.490 
you
first<00:05:05.630> beginning<00:05:06.050> one<00:05:06.320> two<00:05:06.950> three

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.740 

all<00:05:18.220> right<00:05:18.370> so<00:05:18.490> right<00:05:18.670> here<00:05:18.880> we<00:05:19.000> have<00:05:19.150> G<00:05:19.420> sharp

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
all right so right here we have G sharp

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.910 
all right so right here we have G sharp
B<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.260> E<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:21.030> then<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.330> single<00:05:22.600> B<00:05:22.800> then<00:05:23.800> we

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
B and E and then just a single B then we

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.740 
B and E and then just a single B then we
come<00:05:24.130> down<00:05:24.310> for<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:24.640> B<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.150> then<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:25.540> had<00:05:25.720> a

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
come down for a B and then a I had a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.940 
come down for a B and then a I had a
beam<00:05:25.960> spread<00:05:26.170> disease<00:05:26.470> because<00:05:26.650> it's<00:05:26.800> really

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
beam spread disease because it's really

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.810 
beam spread disease because it's really
soft<00:05:27.990> but<00:05:28.990> it's<00:05:29.200> been<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.820> then<00:05:31.330> G<00:05:31.690> sharp<00:05:32.050> B

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
soft but it's been a and then G sharp B

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.580 
soft but it's been a and then G sharp B
then<00:05:33.820> that<00:05:34.000> same<00:05:34.330> B<00:05:34.600> with<00:05:34.780> an<00:05:34.870> F<00:05:35.020> sharp<00:05:35.080> beneath

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
then that same B with an F sharp beneath

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.850 
then that same B with an F sharp beneath
it<00:05:36.360> so<00:05:37.360> if<00:05:37.960> we<00:05:38.050> start<00:05:38.290> with<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.470> right<00:05:38.620> hand

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
it so if we start with the right hand

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.400 
it so if we start with the right hand
right<00:05:38.980> here<00:05:45.300> then<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.420> left<00:05:46.660> hand<00:05:46.960> goes<00:05:46.990> low

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
right here then the left hand goes low

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.130 
right here then the left hand goes low
key<00:05:47.650> but<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:48.460> be<00:05:48.640> touching<00:05:49.480> me<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:49.780> then<00:05:49.870> again

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
key but to be touching me and then again

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.890 
key but to be touching me and then again
five<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.650> one<00:05:51.150> crossover<00:05:52.150> with<00:05:52.420> two<00:05:52.630> pretty

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
five to one crossover with two pretty

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.440 
five to one crossover with two pretty
sharp<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.500> up<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.370> be<00:05:54.520> with<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:54.760> thumb<00:05:55.030> back

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
sharp and up to be with you thumb back

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.930 
sharp and up to be with you thumb back
that<00:05:55.630> a<00:05:55.660> G<00:05:55.930> sharp<00:05:55.960> right<00:05:56.590> down<00:05:56.770> here<00:05:57.250> down<00:05:57.910> to

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
that a G sharp right down here down to

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
that a G sharp right down here down to
base

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.239
