00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going on in the big gimmick of this map

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.550 
going on in the big gimmick of this map
is<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.509> they<00:00:13.019> put<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:14.929> little<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.379> free

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
is that they put the little the free

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
is that they put the little the free
gets<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> flagships<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.609> put<00:00:17.789> them<00:00:17.910> very

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
gets the flagships they put them very

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.060 
gets the flagships they put them very
closely<00:00:18.330> sure<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.020> where<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.410> turrets<00:00:19.859> will

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
closely sure to where the turrets will

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070 
closely sure to where the turrets will
do<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> lot<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> damage<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.900> pretty

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
do a lot of damage and that is pretty

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
do a lot of damage and that is pretty
much<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> only<00:00:22.560> thing<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.100> no<00:00:23.730> saw<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.090> as

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
much the only thing that no saw so as

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
much the only thing that no saw so as
you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> stuff<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.670> on

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you can see here a lot of stuff going on

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
you can see here a lot of stuff going on
they<00:00:27.480> even<00:00:27.689> gave<00:00:27.810> warning<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.710> not

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
they even gave warning if you do not

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.170 
they even gave warning if you do not
like<00:00:29.269> turrets<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.900> play<00:00:31.910> let's<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.059> in

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
like turrets don't play let's get in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.780 
like turrets don't play let's get in
there<00:00:33.360> oh<00:00:33.540> shit<00:00:34.530> oh<00:00:34.680> shut<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.160> again<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:41.640> has

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
there oh shit oh shut up again it has

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.060 
there oh shit oh shut up again it has
been<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> while<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.450> since<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> did<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.110 

space<00:00:47.070> map<00:00:48.920> unless<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
space map unless you can see the the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.490 
space map unless you can see the the
good<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.320> looks

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
good thing about it is that it looks

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
good thing about it is that it looks
like<00:00:52.590> there's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> stuff<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
like there's a lot of stuff going on and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.470 
like there's a lot of stuff going on and
happening<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.530> else<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> hangar<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> think

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
happening now else in a hangar I think

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.470 
happening now else in a hangar I think
they<00:00:57.600> did<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> double<00:00:58.350> row<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.210> fighters<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
they did a double row of fighters to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.179 
they did a double row of fighters to
take<00:01:00.510> off<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.620> theory<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.399> paper<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
take off so in theory on paper this

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
take off so in theory on paper this
battle<00:01:05.189> should<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:06.000> epic<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:07.010> normal

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
battle should be more epic than normal

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.789 
battle should be more epic than normal
levels

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.120 

there's<00:01:16.369> hmm<00:01:17.380> there's<00:01:18.380> only<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:18.859> thing<00:01:19.070> I

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
there's hmm there's only one thing I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.870 
there's hmm there's only one thing I
actually<00:01:19.399> never<00:01:19.880> knew<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:25.070> okay<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:25.369> here<00:01:25.820> you

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
actually never knew so okay so here you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.660 
actually never knew so okay so here you
can<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:27.500> your<00:01:28.070> turrets<00:01:28.369> actually

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
can see and that your turrets actually

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.279 
can see and that your turrets actually
do<00:01:28.850> make<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.060> lot<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.299> difference<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:30.020> can<00:01:30.140> also

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
do make a lot of difference you can also

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.419 
do make a lot of difference you can also
see<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.679> our<00:01:34.659> our<00:01:35.659> our<00:01:36.110> points<00:01:36.590> are<00:01:36.740> going<00:01:37.310> up

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
see that our our our points are going up

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.309 
see that our our our points are going up
really<00:01:37.549> fast<00:01:37.819> and<00:01:38.119> basically<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.899> turrets

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
really fast and basically the turrets

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.039 
really fast and basically the turrets
now<00:01:39.799> actually<00:01:40.280> can<00:01:40.939> do<00:01:41.149> damage<00:01:41.329> against<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
now actually can do damage against the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.499 
now actually can do damage against the
outer<00:01:42.170> ship<00:01:42.469> I<00:01:42.619> mean<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.039> can<00:01:43.420> attack<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
outer ship I mean you can attack the

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.020 
outer ship I mean you can attack the
shields<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:44.929> do<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> lot<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.380> damage<00:01:46.000> do<00:01:47.000> you

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
shields and do a lot of damage do you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.479 
shields and do a lot of damage do you
did<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.630> actually<00:01:47.929> know<00:01:48.250> I've<00:01:49.250> never

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489 
did you actually know I've never

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:52.690 
did you actually know I've never
actually<00:01:49.759> been<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.750> turret<00:01:51.289> really<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
actually been a turret really in in this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.969 
actually been a turret really in in this
antenna<00:01:52.939> game<00:01:53.119> also<00:01:53.329> then<00:01:54.200> maybe<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.709> once

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
antenna game also then maybe the once

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.339 
antenna game also then maybe the once
knife<00:01:55.700> didn't<00:01:56.179> like<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.450> very<00:01:56.539> much<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.110> I've

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
knife didn't like it very much and I've

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:06.730 
knife didn't like it very much and I've
never<00:01:57.590> been<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> after<00:01:58.099> that<00:01:58.220> oh<00:01:58.340> wow<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.549> died

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.589 

these<00:02:07.520> guys<00:02:07.700> are<00:02:07.850> waiting<00:02:08.119> though<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> be

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
these guys are waiting though to be

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:17.380 
these guys are waiting though to be
picked<00:02:08.810> at<00:02:08.959> home<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.860> forget<00:02:10.130> it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.600 

so<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.930> good<00:02:19.650> map<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.250> people<00:02:20.430> who

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so this is a good map for people who

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
so this is a good map for people who
like<00:02:20.730> space<00:02:21.030> battles<00:02:21.480> who<00:02:21.569> are<00:02:21.689> also<00:02:21.840> more

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
like space battles who are also more

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.190 
like space battles who are also more
into<00:02:22.530> seating<00:02:23.459> points<00:02:23.760> away<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.629> going

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
into seating points away then going

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.899 
into seating points away then going
through<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.439> whole<00:02:25.530> section<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> taking<00:02:26.819> out

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
through the whole section of taking out

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.839 
through the whole section of taking out
the<00:02:27.030> shields<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.099> everything's<00:02:29.099> one<00:02:29.549> by<00:02:29.670> one

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
the shields and everything's one by one

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.640 
the shields and everything's one by one

though I think a lot of people that play
this<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.069> spaceman<00:02:32.519> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:32.970> that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.759 

all<00:02:43.940> right<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:44.390> right<00:02:46.810> we<00:02:47.810> are<00:02:47.930> winning<00:02:48.140> by<00:02:48.739> a

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
all right all right we are winning by a

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:03.660 
all right all right we are winning by a
mile<00:02:49.220> though

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.490 

but<00:03:04.670> there<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> lot<00:03:05.270> going<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.660> though<00:03:05.930> then

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
but there is a lot going on though then

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.140

their<00:03:06.770> fighters<00:03:07.130> are<00:03:07.250> also<00:03:07.370> coming<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.000> of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
their fighters are also coming out of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.980 
their fighters are also coming out of
the<00:03:08.240> woodwork<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:11.480> kind<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> epic

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
the woodwork so it is this kind of epic

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.930 
the woodwork so it is this kind of epic
and<00:03:12.110> only<00:03:12.350> made<00:03:12.530> possible<00:03:13.010> by<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.490> fact<00:03:13.760> that

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
and only made possible by the fact that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.550 
and only made possible by the fact that
they<00:03:14.930> put<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.040> two<00:03:16.310> main<00:03:16.730> ships<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.380> close

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
they put the the two main ships so close

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.790 
they put the the two main ships so close
to<00:03:18.650> each<00:03:18.710> other<00:03:19.570> which<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.990> gotta<00:03:21.140> admit<00:03:21.410> this

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
to each other which you gotta admit this

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.410 
to each other which you gotta admit this
kinda<00:03:22.160> has<00:03:22.280> kind<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.700> form<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.060> brilliance

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
kinda has kind of a form of brilliance

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.350 
kinda has kind of a form of brilliance
you<00:03:24.260> had<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.650> idea<00:03:24.830> once<00:03:25.250> my<00:03:25.460> idea<00:03:25.760> did<00:03:26.180> that

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
you had one idea once my idea did that

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.900 
you had one idea once my idea did that
and<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:27.020> turned<00:03:27.200> out<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.440> work<00:03:27.530> great<00:03:27.830> hold<00:03:28.730> on

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and it turned out to work great hold on

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:41.150 
and it turned out to work great hold on
we're<00:03:29.510> gonna<00:03:29.720> go<00:03:29.870> back<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.350> turret

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:04:01.230 

Jesus<00:03:42.060> okay

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.390 

and<00:04:02.380> they<00:04:03.380> have<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> good<00:04:03.770> spawn<00:04:04.160> rate<00:04:06.400> though

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
and they have a good spawn rate though

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.160 
and they have a good spawn rate though
there<00:04:07.610> are<00:04:07.700> still<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:07.940> lot<00:04:08.240> of<00:04:08.270> clones<00:04:08.660> waiting

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
there are still a lot of clones waiting

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.850 
there are still a lot of clones waiting
for<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.740> their<00:04:09.860> ships<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:11.650> think<00:04:12.650> they<00:04:12.710> do<00:04:12.830> a

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
for for their ships I think they do a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.000 
for for their ships I think they do a
good<00:04:13.040> job<00:04:13.100> of<00:04:16.300> respawn<00:04:17.300> so<00:04:17.709> if<00:04:18.709> you're<00:04:18.860> waiting

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
good job of respawn so if you're waiting

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.740 
good job of respawn so if you're waiting
for<00:04:19.160> for<00:04:19.670> a<00:04:19.730> ship<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.180> probably<00:04:20.450> don't<00:04:20.660> have

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
for for a ship you probably don't have

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.530 
for for a ship you probably don't have
to<00:04:20.840> wait<00:04:20.959> long<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:22.100> we<00:04:22.280> are<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.790> fucking

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
to wait long and we are on a fucking

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.580 
to wait long and we are on a fucking
roll<00:04:23.810> over<00:04:24.110> here<00:04:24.230> holy<00:04:24.650> shit<00:04:29.380> you're<00:04:30.380> doing

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590

now<00:04:39.920> like<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.190> said<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.520> not<00:04:40.970> have<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.870> many

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
now like I said I do not have that many

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.080 
now like I said I do not have that many
space<00:04:42.940> maps<00:04:43.940> in<00:04:44.390> my<00:04:44.720> list<00:04:45.370> now<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.610> think<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.060> have

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
space maps in my list now I think I have

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.460 
space maps in my list now I think I have
one<00:04:47.360> or<00:04:47.510> two<00:04:47.660> more<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.500> usually<00:04:48.890> read<00:04:49.160> if

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
one or two more and I usually read if

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.170 
one or two more and I usually read if
the<00:04:51.470> type<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.800> battle<00:04:52.070> will<00:04:52.250> be<00:04:52.370> different<00:04:52.820> if

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
the type of battle will be different if

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.770 
the type of battle will be different if
there<00:04:53.780> would<00:04:53.930> be<00:04:53.960> new<00:04:54.490> ships<00:04:55.490> new<00:04:56.420> mother

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
there would be new ships new mother

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.570 
there would be new ships new mother
ships<00:04:57.080> maybe<00:04:57.320> more<00:04:57.920> mother<00:04:58.190> ships<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.460> know
