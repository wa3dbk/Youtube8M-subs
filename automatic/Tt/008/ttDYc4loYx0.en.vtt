00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello girls how are you welcome today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.559
 I bring you this dessert very fast 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.960
 prepare and well in my country it's called 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.299
 cream flipped maybe in other countries 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 they are called pudding or it is called flan 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.430
 Neapolitan is a very rich dessert and therefore 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 very tasty for this season of 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.820
 summer 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.489
 as I tell you girls this is super 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.380
 simple and can do it with 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.570
 ingredients that can be obtained in 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.449
 anywhere in the country that you 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.879
 like and now I tell you for this 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.489
 I am using a milk cart 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.100
 condensed which is roughly 500 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.720
 milliliters also half a liter of milk 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 a quarter of blond sugar 10 eggs a 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.380
 trickle of lemon and a splash of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.750
 vanilla 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.820
 well let's start doing it 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.040
 this dessert loves my husband so 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 I really like to do it 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.800
 let's start putting that little room 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.500
 of sugar in a very small pot 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.740
 then we are going to move it and we are going to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.470
 add a splash of water just a 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.870
 little until more or less the sugar 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.720
 it's a little dampened let's give it 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.790
 a few laps we are also going to add a 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.940
 little bit of what would be the trickle of 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.190
 lemon and let's go round and round 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.830
 no more laps girls until this 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.229
 start to boil and take one more color 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.500
 dark more or less as a color 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.500
 candy 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.290
 what I recommend a lot is to put it to 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.030
 very low fire and be moving 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.340
 enough our honey so that we are not 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.890
 burning and then when it is already miss 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.900
 girls we added it to our 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.880
 container to our molds I'm going to 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.430
 use then the mold that you 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.860
 want in this case I'm using 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.650
 a redondito so as you see 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.810
 girls with the cold mold my candy 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.460
 they are already doing so I put it for 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.460
 all all all sides 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.940
 and now we will start doing our 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.840
 cream let's add milk too 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.120
 condensed milk 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.099
 and I 'm doing it girls in two 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.220
 parts because my blender is a little bit 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.890
 small I will also add what 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 would be the eggs added the 10 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.620
 eggs and then finally the trickle 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.620
 vanilla 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.690
 Well, this is going to start liquefying 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.880
 girls and keep in mind that I'm 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.920
 using the amount of 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 ingredients for mold size 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 you can also use 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.140
 depending on the amount they want 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.110
 make and put the condensed milk 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.600
 according to the sweet that you also 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.560
 want 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.560
 in minutes 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.170
 ah 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.680
 by then my mold is cold 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.500
 and my candy is hard so let's go 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.400
 begin to add all the part of the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.500
 liquid 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.290
 I'm using a girl strainer and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.480
 we are going to do it little by little and 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.900
 I do this so that they do not form 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.000
 those little balls of oxygen inside and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.430
 then at the time that our desserts are 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.739
 ready and cut it do not have as cheeses 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.480
 small holes and look like a cheese if not 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.480
 see as more than lawful 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.010
 Now I'm going to put it in my oven 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.019
 microwaves about 140 in a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.150
 you can also do it in 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.090
 bath marÃ­a but for mixed with that more 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.330
 easy and afterwards girls we are going to have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.120
 this result even this is hot and 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.270
 let's put it in our refrigerator 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.340
 to cool 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.620
 and here girls are already served 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.240
 Little juice cited and very rich so 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.270
 I hope this recipe is super easy 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.520
 have liked all of you a kiss and 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.120
 I take good care of myself 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.120
 bye bye
