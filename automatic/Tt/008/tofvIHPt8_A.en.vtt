ways you don't have the AB joint on it
which<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.549> hurts<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> figure<00:02:03.149> some<00:02:03.450> but

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.309 
at the same time you know we got the
waist<00:02:07.950> joint<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.790> can<00:02:09.149> work<00:02:09.299> with<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.690> if

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
waist joint and I can work with that if

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
waist joint and I can work with that if
it<00:02:10.530> weren't<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.860> waist<00:02:11.069> joint<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.670> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
it weren't a waist joint where it was so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.470 
it weren't a waist joint where it was so
pain

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
pain

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240 
pain
painfully<00:02:13.110> obvious<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.770> turned<00:02:13.920> you

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
painfully obvious that it was turned you

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.530 
painfully obvious that it was turned you
can<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.670> flat<00:02:14.940> part<00:02:15.150> on

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
can see that flat part on

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.199 
can see that flat part on
either<00:02:15.659> side<00:02:15.980> it'd<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.159> easier<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.730> understand

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
either side it'd be easier to understand

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.569 
either side it'd be easier to understand
but<00:02:19.099> you<00:02:20.099> know<00:02:20.219> as<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.099> greatest

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
but you know as is it's not the greatest

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.330 
but you know as is it's not the greatest
but<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:24.000> manageable<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.719> me<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.159> think

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
but it is manageable to me and I think

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.709 
but it is manageable to me and I think
he<00:02:26.430> looks<00:02:26.579> kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.879> cool<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.359> you<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.599> get

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
he looks kind of cool and you can get

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.330 
he looks kind of cool and you can get
him<00:02:27.840> into<00:02:27.989> some<00:02:28.140> nice<00:02:28.319> poses<00:02:28.799> with<00:02:28.950> his<00:02:29.069> claws

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
him into some nice poses with his claws

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.899 
him into some nice poses with his claws
he<00:02:30.150> has<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.109> know<00:02:31.230> swivel<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.549> elbow

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
he has the you know swivel at the elbow

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.770 
he has the you know swivel at the elbow
instead<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.510> an<00:02:33.659> elbow<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.260> bicep<00:02:34.650> swivel

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
instead of an elbow and a bicep swivel

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.940 
instead of an elbow and a bicep swivel
and<00:02:36.780> he<00:02:37.019> rotates<00:02:37.349> at<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.530> wrist<00:02:37.799> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and he rotates at the wrist and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.410 
and he rotates at the wrist and
everything<00:02:38.310> he<00:02:38.489> does<00:02:38.609> not<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:39.000> double

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
everything he does not have double

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.490 
everything he does not have double
jointed<00:02:39.750> knees

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
jointed knees

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.770 
jointed knees
he<00:02:41.220> has<00:02:41.340> single<00:02:41.790> jointed<00:02:42.120> knees<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:48.329> yeah

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
he has single jointed knees and so yeah

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.629 
he has single jointed knees and so yeah
but<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:49.439> think<00:02:49.560> he's<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.859> solid<00:02:50.250> figure<00:02:50.400> all

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639

but I think he's a solid figure all
around

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
