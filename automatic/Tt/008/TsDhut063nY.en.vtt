soccer<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.980> big<00:00:47.129> question<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
soccer so with this the big question is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.049 
soccer so with this the big question is
what<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> treatment<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.050> injuries

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
what is the treatment for these injuries

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
what is the treatment for these injuries
well<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.539> impressive<00:00:52.110> right<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
well it's not impressive right now the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.490 
well it's not impressive right now the
only<00:00:53.280> recommendation<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.329> rest<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.110> athlete

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
only recommendation is rest the athlete

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
only recommendation is rest the athlete
is<00:00:55.590> taken<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> game<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.699> he<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:56.969> she

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is taken out of the game and he or she

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
is taken out of the game and he or she
takes<00:00:57.420> time<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.020> rehab<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.350> comeback<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
takes time to rehab the comeback so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
takes time to rehab the comeback so
here's<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.030> obvious<00:01:00.510> question<00:01:00.770> how<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
here's an obvious question how do we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.799 
here's an obvious question how do we
initially<00:01:02.460> treat<00:01:02.820> almost<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.420> other

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
initially treat almost all other

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.679 
initially treat almost all other
injuries<00:01:05.659> well<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.960> ice<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:08.689> heck

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
injuries well it's ice of course heck

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
injuries well it's ice of course heck
athletes<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.619> been<00:01:10.740> using<00:01:10.950> ice<00:01:11.280> after

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
athletes have been using ice after

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
athletes have been using ice after
practice<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.720> injuries<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.320> years<00:01:13.650> all

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
practice and for injuries for years all

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
practice and for injuries for years all
with<00:01:14.369> beneficial<00:01:14.970> effects<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> not

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
with beneficial effects so this is not

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
with beneficial effects so this is not
new<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> biggest<00:01:18.090> question<00:01:18.630> should<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
new so the biggest question should be is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
new so the biggest question should be is
there<00:01:19.439> any<00:01:19.619> research<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.520> supports<00:01:20.700> icing

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
there any research that supports icing

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
there any research that supports icing
your<00:01:21.570> head<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.960> brain<00:01:22.170> injuries<00:01:22.729> well<00:01:23.729> there

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
your head for brain injuries well there

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.480 
your head for brain injuries well there
has<00:01:24.509> been<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.290> 50<00:01:25.740> years<00:01:25.770> something

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
has been for about 50 years something

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.179 
has been for about 50 years something
called<00:01:26.759> therapeutic<00:01:27.570> hypothermia<00:01:28.560> has

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
called therapeutic hypothermia has

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.700 
called therapeutic hypothermia has
existed<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> has<00:01:30.420> done<00:01:30.630> real<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.290> such

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
existed and has done real well on such

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.399 
existed and has done real well on such
animals<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.280> rats<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.119> also<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.900> humans<00:01:34.259> as

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
animals as rats but also for humans as

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.969

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
something called selective brain cooling

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
something called selective brain cooling
especially<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.500> infants<00:01:43.950> show<00:01:44.369> very

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
especially in infants show very

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
especially in infants show very
promising<00:01:45.299> research<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> rat

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
promising research but it's in the rat

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
promising research but it's in the rat
research<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.210> most<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> incredible

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
research that most of the incredible

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
research that most of the incredible
studies<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.710> been<00:01:49.740> done<00:01:49.890> showing<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
studies have been done showing that

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300 
studies have been done showing that
selectively<00:01:51.570> ice<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.049> their<00:01:52.170> head<00:01:52.439> after<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
selectively ice in their head after a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.450 
selectively ice in their head after a
brain<00:01:53.640> injury<00:01:53.670> shows<00:01:54.240> remarkable<00:01:54.630> benefits

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
brain injury shows remarkable benefits

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.760 
brain injury shows remarkable benefits
so<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.700> athletes<00:01:57.659> may<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> consider

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so now athletes may want to consider

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.130 
so now athletes may want to consider
icing<00:01:59.250> their<00:01:59.610> brain<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.810> rest<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
icing their brain as well the rest of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.560 
icing their brain as well the rest of
their<00:02:01.229> body<00:02:01.259> after<00:02:01.860> practice<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:03.240> protect

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
their body after practice to protect

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.209 
their body after practice to protect
themselves<00:02:03.719> from<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> those<00:02:04.619> hits<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
themselves from some of those hits that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.740 
themselves from some of those hits that
accumulate<00:02:05.729> after<00:02:06.149> long<00:02:06.390> days<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.930> field

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
accumulate after long days on the field

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
accumulate after long days on the field
with<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.050> information<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.890> question

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
with all this information the question

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.780 
with all this information the question
should<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.430> why<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.940> i<00:02:11.970> stir<00:02:12.330> head<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.790> well

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790
