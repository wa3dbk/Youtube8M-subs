00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
going back to a UT we think the intake

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.110 
going back to a UT we think the intake
there<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.900> particularly<00:01:00.320> high<00:01:00.500> caliber

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
and that produces better students out

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.870 
and that produces better students out

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
going to survive on thinkers I believe

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.360 
going to survive on thinkers I believe
that<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.660> edge<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.739> industry

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
that I have the edge in the industry

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.039 
that I have the edge in the industry
mainly<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.420> degree<00:02:35.810> isn't

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
mainly because this degree isn't

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.300 
mainly because this degree isn't
actually<00:02:36.320> often<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.920> your

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
actually often in your

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:48.780 
actually often in your
in<00:02:37.550> New<00:02:37.849> Zealand<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.110> new

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.100 

there's<00:02:49.790> been<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> big<00:02:50.210> change<00:02:50.420> especially<00:02:50.780> in

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
there's been a big change especially in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.840 
there's been a big change especially in
graphic<00:02:51.410> design<00:02:51.560> because<00:02:52.130> everybody<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
graphic design because everybody is to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.520 
graphic design because everybody is to
think<00:02:53.030> graphic<00:02:53.330> design<00:02:53.630> was<00:02:54.020> commercial

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
think graphic design was commercial

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.290 
think graphic design was commercial
artists<00:02:54.890> they<00:02:55.070> made<00:02:55.310> stuff<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:55.790> other<00:02:55.880> people

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
artists they made stuff for other people

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.230 
artists they made stuff for other people
but<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:57.620> changing<00:02:58.130> its<00:02:58.370> changing<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:59.000> as

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
but that's changing its changing now as

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.820 
but that's changing its changing now as
countries<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.810> easier<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.470> got<00:03:00.680> to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
countries like easier and have got to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.920 
countries like easier and have got to
get<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.010> voice<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.610> compete<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.810> have

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
get a voice to compete you have to have

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.120 
get a voice to compete you have to have
people<00:03:03.110> who<00:03:03.350> have<00:03:03.440> got<00:03:03.620> something<00:03:04.010> behind

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
people who have got something behind

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.920 
people who have got something behind
them<00:03:04.520> they're<00:03:04.700> speaking<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.450> known<00:03:05.690> as

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
them they're speaking it's known as

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.230 
them they're speaking it's known as
being<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.500> good<00:03:06.650> University<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.670> think

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
being a good University and I think

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.540 
being a good University and I think
people<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.570> come<00:03:08.780> out<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.410> they<00:03:10.340> know

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
people that come out of a to they know

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.120 
people that come out of a to they know
of<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.880> hard<00:03:11.180> working<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.720> had<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.740> pop<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
of a hard working and had the pop you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.000 
of a hard working and had the pop you
know<00:03:13.190> push<00:03:13.459> themselves<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.800> sort<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:15.830> have

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
know push themselves and sort of have

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.010 
know push themselves and sort of have
been<00:03:16.130> already<00:03:16.459> exposed<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.840> work

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
been already exposed to the work

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.630 
been already exposed to the work
environment<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.770> would<00:03:18.980> definitely<00:03:19.130> recommend

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
environment I would definitely recommend

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
environment I would definitely recommend
a<00:03:20.060> degree<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.630> did<00:03:20.870> like<00:03:21.410> mainly<00:03:21.830> because

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
a degree that I did like mainly because

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.290 
a degree that I did like mainly because
you<00:03:22.190> are<00:03:22.520> working<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.120> latest

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
you are working with the latest

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.420 
you are working with the latest
technology<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:24.260> industry<00:03:24.709> standards<00:03:25.190> and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
technology and industry standards and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.520 
technology and industry standards and
there<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.120> communication<00:03:27.020> between<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
there is that communication between the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.380 
there is that communication between the
industry<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.310> University<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.209> you've

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
industry and the University so you've

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.970 
industry and the University so you've
always<00:03:29.600> got<00:03:29.840> contacts<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.770> make

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
always got contacts and you make

always got contacts and you make
contacts<00:03:31.489> through<00:03:31.820> people<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.690> it's<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.140> very

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
