00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
career mode is really the highlight of

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.580 
career mode is really the highlight of
the<00:04:14.260> game<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:15.459> like<00:04:16.270> again<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.080> gone<00:04:17.260> it's

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the game it's like again it's gone it's

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.470 
the game it's like again it's gone it's
got<00:04:17.770> lots<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:18.070> silly<00:04:18.609> unnecessary<00:04:19.270> swearing

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
got lots of silly unnecessary swearing

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.450 
got lots of silly unnecessary swearing
which<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.290> either<00:04:20.380> choose<00:04:20.680> death<00:04:20.950> to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
which you can either choose death to

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.420 
which you can either choose death to
have<00:04:21.640> in<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.910> game<00:04:22.090> or<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:23.430> that's

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
have in the game or not and that's

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.860 
have in the game or not and that's
entirely<00:04:24.910> up<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.450> taste

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
entirely up to your taste

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.469 
entirely up to your taste
so<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> game<00:04:27.010> overall<00:04:27.430> it's<00:04:27.940> pretty<00:04:28.000> good

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
so the game overall it's pretty good

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.590 
so the game overall it's pretty good
it's<00:04:29.169> not<00:04:29.470> it's<00:04:30.070> not<00:04:30.160> got<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.370> greatest<00:04:30.669> 3ds

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
it's not it's not got the greatest 3ds

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.110 
it's not it's not got the greatest 3ds
graphics<00:04:32.169> we've<00:04:32.350> seen<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:33.100> 3d<00:04:33.490> effect<00:04:33.520> is

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
graphics we've seen the 3d effect is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.040 
graphics we've seen the 3d effect is
there<00:04:34.600> it's<00:04:35.139> not<00:04:35.320> bad<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:37.330> city<00:04:37.600> looks<00:04:37.720> a

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
there it's not bad the city looks a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.710 
there it's not bad the city looks a
little<00:04:38.199> bit<00:04:38.440> sparse<00:04:39.750> but<00:04:40.750> um<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:42.040> know<00:04:42.720> it's

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
little bit sparse but um you know it's

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.090 
little bit sparse but um you know it's
not<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.139> know<00:04:44.169> like<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:44.949> pretty

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
not you know like so it's pretty

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.800 
not you know like so it's pretty
mediocre<00:04:45.430> graphics<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.389> they're<00:04:46.570> pretty

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
mediocre graphics that they're pretty

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.990 
mediocre graphics that they're pretty
good<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.080> places<00:04:47.590> but<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.190> little<00:04:48.880> bit

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
good in places but a little bit

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.780 
good in places but a little bit
uninspiring<00:04:49.630> in<00:04:49.840> places<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:51.040> same<00:04:51.310> as<00:04:51.460> i<00:04:51.580> said

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
uninspiring in places the same as i said

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.790 
uninspiring in places the same as i said
is<00:04:51.910> great<00:04:52.240> that's<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.050> speech<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.620> voice

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
is great that's the speech the voice

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.670 
is great that's the speech the voice
acting<00:04:54.220> is<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.580> okay<00:04:54.880> pretty<00:04:55.840> poor<00:04:56.080> in<00:04:56.199> places

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
acting is is okay pretty poor in places

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.590 
acting is is okay pretty poor in places
and<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.310> i<00:04:57.370> said<00:04:57.639> it<00:04:57.760> is<00:04:57.820> full<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.180> swearing

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
and like i said it is full of swearing

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.860 
and like i said it is full of swearing
so<00:04:59.199> overall<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:01.060> a<00:05:01.090> bad<00:05:01.300> game<00:05:01.510> at<00:05:01.690> all

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
so overall it's not a bad game at all

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.270 
so overall it's not a bad game at all
