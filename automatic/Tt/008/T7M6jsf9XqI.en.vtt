00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 they handed out the prize as the most 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.780
 popular in the USA in the formula card 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.780
 what does that mean 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.260
 it's more popular the title says no me 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.660
 like to give interviews to Colombia because 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.250
 They are very bad and do and spend 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.050
 interview but the holder any 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.939
 phrase that I say out there is the headline 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 the image of Juan Pablo Amoya in 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.010
 Colombia can not be worse the press does not 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.080
 he wants it although he thanks him that each 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.700
 once it opens the mouth of a headline and 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.699
 orit and here last week they did 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.440
 they ask me if it's going to help the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.940
 Colombians can not help you the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.429
 Colombians because I work as a team 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.800
 and first of all it's my team and everything and 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.859
 the owner is I'm not going to help the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.539
 Colombians then what happens that the 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.819
 people tell you is that book got rid 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.800
 so much of montoya is that it is painted 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.749
 I do not know what and then people go out 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.429
 ignorant in the radio does the same thing 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.789
 comments that the bad is painted 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.129
 class the bad taste the gross I do not know what and 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.559
 It's not like what I'm going to do 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.629
 is to force an interview in Colombia if 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.640
 only thing they are going to do is turn it over 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.860
 to be a badly but not me everything 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 I have employers in Colombia do not give 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 a colombia 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 I'm very grateful because people do not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 he supported me and everything but the press is very 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 bad is that is is that the press is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.350
 very bad then everyone is very bad 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.030
 waiting for interviews that I give that is 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 outside the team 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 because I do what he tells me 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.580
 I work for the team and the team 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.369
 says nito interview with this this this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 this this and the rest of your free time 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.310
 then I did not enter, it never fits 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 interviews of those who do not tell me the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.790
 team wants a stable interview with the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.700
 team and organize with the team go a 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.560
 career as everyone does and how 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.300
 It did not help that I am a woman who does not 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 takes away the interview and always said 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.360
 it bothers me something I say it and I do not me and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.200

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.509

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.760
 super colombian that I really want my 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.530

 Colombian name alto and everything and that the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.420
 people believe in me everything but for this 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 for it to work it just has to be 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.290
 one for oneself not for anyone else what 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.370

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.770

 moment he realized that he really is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.080

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.110
 Colombian who can afford to
