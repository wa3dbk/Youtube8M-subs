 the architect has been fresh for 50 years 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.309
 design the cities of the future 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.460
 all its structures derive from the simple forms that fascinated him from 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.079
 small 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.770
 when i was 12 years old I was creating a gif looking at a bolt on the table 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.910
 north I saw the cities of the future 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.680
 I add I think it enhances the time all inventions are based on 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 experiences like this. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.310
 fresh thinks that the man will be forced to colonize the sea if the earth 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.250
 it will become overcrowded 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.300
 bulletin board the earth can comfortably accommodate and a certain population 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.210
 heck if this exceeds the capacity of the earth tomorrow we will have to push ourselves 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.980
 towards the sea 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 building on the cities 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.590
 working in his studio in florida fresh from decades you realize projects 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 details of its futuristic ocean ikea cities 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 also builds prototypes by continuously experimenting with new ones 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 materials 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 fitet even in one of these 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.660
 fresh also exulted projects to transport the structures into the sea 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.010
 will consist of modular sections assembled on the ground by robots and then 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.010
 towed to their final destination 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.210
 other structures will be made of hi-tec materials called metals a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.790
 shape memory 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.779
 why these metals can be twisted 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:17.679
 escort are you ready for marelli l amore then subjected to a certain temperature 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.679
 these materials return exactly to their original form 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.549
 constructions made with shape memory metals can be compressed 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.719
 in small nightmares for transport 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.929
 and then upon arrival bring back the original dimensions 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.009
 in almost instantly you will see a building going under your eyes 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.009
 and without requiring any flight by man 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.289
 the vision of fresco vault 3 architecture

 he considers his cities as tools to promote the development of 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.929
 human values 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.639
 I believe that the environment can affect our values â€‹â€‹on our relationship 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.579
 with other wishes also to me but what the ideals of the future will be I hope 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.049
 in a world without war without oil without fanaticism without prejudice 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.199
 the future must sound like an invitation for everyone via college kit includes 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.609
 insurance because the problems that affect everyone via canepari 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
 there 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.379
 but the problems that affect freedom right now are not in nature 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.099
 more immediate 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.459
 on the bridge the captain pushes to the maximum in 100motori of the ship 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.489
 it must reach the safest deep waters where the tsunami cannot 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.869
 destroy his ship 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 rai 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.459
 still less than 30 meters from the English course 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.689
 from babylon is crying straight at him at 900 kilometers per hour 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.719
 but he is facing a crucian text 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:17.470
 the captain looks at the monitor while the crew the passengers get ready 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:19.789
 the impact 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.880
 maura la freedom he will survive the dream of the Normans xd 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.240
 it will turn into three million tons of rondanini scattered on the bottom 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240
 ocean 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.199

 freedom has passed the test 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.219
 at least this time 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.499
 no floating cities like freedom can be irresistible to 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.149
 those who love to dream in great rich can afford it 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.190
 walter the types of seaside cities like those of fresh can be one 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.430
 more concrete solution for nations facing explosions 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.770
 Demographic 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.389
 both projects can look fantastic 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.389
 never on these ideas that progress sometimes advances 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.089
