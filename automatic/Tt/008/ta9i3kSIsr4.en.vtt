at the squad that Chris has got to
choose<00:00:56.949> from<00:00:57.159> I<00:00:57.429> think<00:00:58.120> this<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.389> probably<00:00:58.659> his

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
choose from I think this is probably his

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.039 
choose from I think this is probably his
best<00:00:59.979> option<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:00.940> this<00:01:01.030> side<00:01:01.089> there's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
best option and it on this side there's

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.719 
best option and it on this side there's
no<00:01:02.139> James<00:01:02.440> Chester<00:01:02.679> sure<00:01:03.159> who's<00:01:03.549> been

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
no James Chester sure who's been

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.430 
no James Chester sure who's been
outstanding<00:01:03.850> with<00:01:04.420> Ashley<00:01:04.930> Williams<00:01:05.080> in<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
outstanding with Ashley Williams in the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.010 
outstanding with Ashley Williams in the
heart<00:01:05.590> defense<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.100> he<00:01:06.220> will<00:01:06.370> be<00:01:06.490> missed<00:01:06.670> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
heart defense so he will be missed I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.630 
heart defense so he will be missed I
totally<00:01:08.020> over<00:01:08.380> Ben<00:01:08.530> do<00:01:08.680> know<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.369> I<00:01:09.460> thought

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
totally over Ben do know and I thought

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.310 
totally over Ben do know and I thought
about<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.030> because<00:01:10.240> probably<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:11.140> would

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
about that because probably it would

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.749 
about that because probably it would
give<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.590> better<00:01:11.770> balance<00:01:12.159> being<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.490> natural

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
give you better balance being a natural

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.550 
give you better balance being a natural
left<00:01:12.939> foot<00:01:13.090> sir<00:01:13.270> but<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.110> think<00:01:14.380> we<00:01:14.469> need

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
left foot sir but I think we need

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.440 
left foot sir but I think we need
experience<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.729> heart<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> Defence<00:01:16.030> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
experience in the heart of Defence and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.209

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.599 
to freedom bail and ramsey is that why
they<00:01:38.289> wouldn't<00:01:38.530> do<00:01:38.619> maybe<00:01:38.829> two<00:01:39.009> banks<00:01:39.280> or<00:01:39.429> four

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
they wouldn't do maybe two banks or four

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.630 
they wouldn't do maybe two banks or four
and<00:01:39.820> yeah<00:01:40.689> i<00:01:40.719> think<00:01:41.649> so<00:01:41.950> because<00:01:42.100> bail<00:01:42.399> will<00:01:42.609> be

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
and yeah i think so because bail will be

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.459 
and yeah i think so because bail will be
fine<00:01:42.969> with<00:01:43.179> Ruiz<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.630> top<00:01:43.929> and<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.109> fourth<00:01:44.320> or

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
fine with Ruiz up top and a fourth or

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.489 
fine with Ruiz up top and a fourth or
two<00:01:44.679> or<00:01:45.159> whether<00:01:46.000> he's<00:01:46.149> like<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.600> Ramsey<00:01:47.350> you
