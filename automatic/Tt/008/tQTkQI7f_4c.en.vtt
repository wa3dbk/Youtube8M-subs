00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.730
 and very good to everyone here is present 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.730
 p 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.830
 with the download and an installation of a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.590
 mode called blog magic 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.199
 here is the good way I'm going to 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.920
 teach how to install this mode 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:26.340
 I do not know much about what it is but good 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.790
 about more about the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.710
 what was used the a magic called 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.739
 to the arcane magic that I think I think is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.020
 real and the truth I do not know is simply a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.480
 mod 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.720
 so good 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.720
 good what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.040
 in the minecraft force 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.470
 that will be given in the registration and 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.660
 reason is the only thing we will need 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.660
 to download it then we give it 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.440
 we are going here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.140
 these are all the counts and things that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 has the engine 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380
 Yes, good 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.049
 here is the download as the force 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.399
 giffords 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.399
 and the way I call 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.289
 and this is the way 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.439
 so to download the forum the force 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:48.230
 We give here and we give you where to install 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.550
 if we give or here as you want 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.550
 the version you want 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.140
 they give to whoever gives what is to download 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 and it would discharge into the engine 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.330
 I 'm not going to climb anymore because 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.080
 I have the result of this download what 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.020
 that is going to leave you is this file that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.850
 it's called brought magic 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.760
 close this and here yes 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:25.610
 well let's use this for him 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.610
 let's move this to the desktop 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.580
 and we release advertising 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.800
 we are not going to need the macro forum anymore 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.570
 well let's go here in download and it 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.570
 I would be unloading the minecraft force 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.840
 let's wait for this to end 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.910
 then I'll post there and we'll go back 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.220
 well we have returned the download goes 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:13.209
 to last around about 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.930
 50 seconds out there we already have the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.930
 two files 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.580
 ok then the first ones we 're going to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.210
 do is double click minecraft 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.560
 freud to minecraft force install and it 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.560
 will open us a window right now 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.909
 well and they give him then install 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.500
 digital fine here is where it's located 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.040
 it's a fat one in my case I have it 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:47.370
 in app data roaming point minecraft yes 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.680
 what is it to run app data to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.650
 percent app data percent 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.659
 let's accept and here there is no point 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.260
 minecraft we have 3 these are the many 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.549
 I already have this and here it is good 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.629
 folder is fine they will not have it 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.850
 obviously this folder gets 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.520
 after installing 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.610
 the minecraft force that is what allows 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.770
 you can have the mode we accept 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.730
 and we will be installed the force is that I do not 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.490
 I will do it because I already have it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.610
 well then we will start the minecraft 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.060
 it does not matter if it 's pirate or premium it's not 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.060
 indifferent 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.310

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:08.129
