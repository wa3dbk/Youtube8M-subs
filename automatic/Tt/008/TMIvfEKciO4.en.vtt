00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.960
 ah 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.559
 ah 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.440
 hello how good in this video what 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.439
 let's analyze is the main 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.500
 Differences between the output helmet 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.980
 step and the explicit helmet that we both 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.980
 Question 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:35.610
 this would be the helmet speed this case is 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.460
 but the main difference that you see 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.980
 right now it's the sad subject 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.980
 splitter comes in a cardboard box 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.430
 and then there is a listening with 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.420
 good if I can not 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.360
 it's quite the dow with a handle to be able 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.400
 transport it 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.000
 handle it more easily 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.960
 the theme let's say the color 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 this would be the white color and this gentleman 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.010
 spyro in black if you look at the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 rear 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 with the spi facebook yes that varies 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.650
 this is black and white then in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 white this part that is blank 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.409
 appears in red and this 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:33.219
 is everything is a piece would be all white and 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.679
 black is where are you are you say 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.950
 are these projections do not change from 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.950
 colour 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.510
 let the mask both mask 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 the cairo as in the celestial is the same 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.990
 and it 's a mask that can be changed from 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.930
 different colors of color in this series 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.120
 of dark items for sun theme there is 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.020
 a transparent and there is an orange to 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.020
 when there is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:11.369
 the good handling is the mask can be 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.369
 remove so much in the air 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.860
 and if you notice how it is very simple 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.500
 system leads to the commas that go 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.690
 housed in the sides of the helmet that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 what allows you to lift it then 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.310
 if you want if you enter the tunnel or the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.340
 garage or a dark area what can you 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.220
 to do is to go up from the mask and you already have 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.220
 you already have visible what you want to download 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.420
 well we appreciate more boxes 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:02.719
 more air tickets theme differences 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.090
 in both models they carry the grid and 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.680
 it's a pretty effective grid though 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.709
 if you realize it is a size 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.780
 quite small 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.349
 the entrance of said inscribed and things 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.719
 however in space you see that the 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.909
 grids arrive almost to the middle of the 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.860
 helmet however in the speed this then 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.190
 do not 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.660
 you only have three and be here because already 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.940
 no longer 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.940
 another difference in the inside part 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:40.500
 and de esther does not carry a membrane 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.160
 grid that is adjustable 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 in space if this membrane is this 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.050
 portfolio that goes along with our two 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 tweezers what it does is to prevent the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.710
 helmet moves and the adjustment is 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.130
 much greater 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.600
 one thing that characteristic of these two 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.830
 helmets if you notice 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.550
 they have very few pads this is 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.890
 very beneficial facing the heat 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.680
 he circulates very easily inside and 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.680
 then the head is heated 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.170
 the spin is stubborn 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:28.830
 more differences and it's not 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.830
 built in two layers 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:39.930
 are two structures with only one 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:50.640
 the theme of adjustment the space adjusts 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.640
 much more fits much more 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:01.439
 the feeling of face to the outside is that 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.800
 wear a bigger helmet you want 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.800
 we step 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.590
 more things about these two helmets you see these 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.280
 tapes here our tapes are 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.360
 reflective 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.479
 when it is done at night illuminated 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.680
 the light of a car that what it does is the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.680
 helmet 22 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.529
 external adjustment such as adjustment through 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:39.799
 the crutch on both models 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:44.219
 it's pretty good and it's a roulette that 

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:48.379
 then you can see it in the plans more 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.379
 shorter that is adjustable 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:06:01.300
 another remarkable thing about these helmets the 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.300
 system of houses so 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.210
 the very simple very fast system of 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.600
 place that with this cut is pulled and 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.600
 leaves fast 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:22.139
 although it is a helmet focused on 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:24.360
 aerodynamic is not 100% aero but yes that 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.729
 You could focus on helmets for 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.960
 distance is also gradually being 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:33.450
 Seeing a lot at close range 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.620
 to start transitions the 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.280
 recommendable 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.520
 you put the helmet of the bicycle and the 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.250
 visor as it is a helmet that speaks what 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.250
 It's pretty good, you leave it 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.450
 transition 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.560
 and be as 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.490
 well let's say it 's teaching the 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.449
 main differences between the helmet 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:09.810
 spears and stevie the case for more to 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.229
 more data then we can consult the 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.229
 page
