00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.620
 Hello, I'm Elodie Beaucent, coach in nutrition, thinness and vitality for you 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.160
 to restore the pleasure of eating healthy. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.269
 Why say stop with cabbage soup diets? 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.050
 First, first reason is a diet. And diets, it's important to 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 go out since 95% of diets will do that you will take back your weight after 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 5 years systematically. So, it's important to definitely get out of these 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.570
 diet guidelines. In addition, the cabbage soup diet is strict, 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.239
 that is to say, we can eat only cabbage that is mixed with onions, tomatoes. 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.940
 There are always the same things in the soup, peppers. It's very monotonous. 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 We do not enjoy ourselves. It's really boring. There is no variety, no 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.939
 creativity, no discovery of new tastes. So, this is really not the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.030
 the most fun part. So, both the first phase of the scheme 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.950
 cabbage soup can be interesting when you consume only soup for 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.780
 a few days because it allows you to do a detox, it allows you to put 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.189
 a little to zero your inner physiological pendulums and that allows you the blow of 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.610
 slim down a little bit. For example after a holiday season, 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.659
 or a period of excess, it can be interesting. 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.290
 On the other hand, where it does not go at all is that often on the fourth day of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.140
 soup cabbage soup, you look on the net the classic dieting of diets. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.340
 We re-integrate products like milk. If you take milk while you come 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 to do three days where you only eat vegetables and fruits, this is really 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.799
 not a present to make to your body because already, dairy products with any 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.170
 the acidity that it brings into the body are not our best friends for life. 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.229
 Far from there. In addition, milk is really the product 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.649
 the least digestible slag that is, the least necessary too. So, it's really 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.799
 not imperative to integrate the milk. And even that can be counterproductive. It can 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.750
 have negative physiological effects on your health. 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.570
 Just after the milk, it is the red meat that we integrate into the soup diet. 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.600
 cabbage. There, again, we are not at all in 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.160
 a principle of detox and well-being, and digestive comfort and drainage, but many 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.850
 more in products that, reintroduced like that especially after three days of fruits 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.780
 and vegetables, can be really counterproductive compared to your desire to lose weight. 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.610
 So really, the cabbage soup diet has its limits. 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.880
 And basic, as it is restrictive and very restrictive, so when you are 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.110
 not in a positive dynamic of change, creativity and new discovery 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.240
 tastes, etc., there is a good chance that you are living completely like a diet. 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.790
 You will feel frustrated. You will be fed up. You will be looking forward to 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.310
 it ends. Maybe the cabbage soup diet 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.800
 has kept its promises in terms of weight, where it's true that losing two, three kilos 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 easily in three days and up to 7 pounds in a week, it's express. Except 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.240
 that behind, as you are frustrated during this whole week, you are suddenly bound 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.920
 to compensate more or less consciously and you will necessarily take back your pounds after 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.630
 of a moment. So, it's not really worth it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.110
 cabbage soup diet. It is better to change habits over time. 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.940
 It means taking pleasure in tasting different foods, having new foods 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.380
 recipes to make everyday, have new habits, new products in your closets, 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.990
 a new way of doing your shopping, a new positive state of mind compared 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.130
 taking care of yourself and taking care of your body. And that's when you 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.770
 are in this type of dynamic-there you get the best results.
