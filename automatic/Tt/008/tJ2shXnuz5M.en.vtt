00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
case here is one of the mounts i believe

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.000 
case here is one of the mounts i believe
this<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.180> an<00:03:58.359> Intel<00:03:58.750> bounce<00:03:59.609> out<00:04:00.609> of<00:04:00.780> ya<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
this is an Intel bounce out of ya this

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.520 
this is an Intel bounce out of ya this
is<00:04:03.189> the<00:04:03.340> Intel<00:04:03.670> back<00:04:03.909> plate<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:05.819> this<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
is the Intel back plate and this is the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.699 
is the Intel back plate and this is the
AMD<00:04:08.530> backplate<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.099> will<00:04:09.400> not<00:04:09.639> be<00:04:09.879> using<00:04:10.120> these

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
AMD backplate I will not be using these

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.119 
AMD backplate I will not be using these
I<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:12.220> Andy<00:04:13.109> almost<00:04:14.109> all<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.470> AMD<00:04:14.889> back

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
I have Andy almost all the AMD back

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.770 
I have Andy almost all the AMD back
plates<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.639> can<00:04:15.819> just<00:04:16.000> use<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.329> default<00:04:16.690> one

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
plates you can just use the default one

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.029 
plates you can just use the default one
and<00:04:17.229> they<00:04:18.039> are<00:04:18.400> better<00:04:18.609> than<00:04:18.820> these<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:20.039> then

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
and they are better than these so then

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.170 
and they are better than these so then
you<00:04:21.190> have<00:04:21.400> these<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.590> believe<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.520> one<00:04:24.849> is

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
you have these and I believe this one is

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.480 
you have these and I believe this one is
the<00:04:28.470> this<00:04:29.470> one<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.979> for<00:04:30.280> AMD<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:33.070> one<00:04:33.310> is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
the this one is for AMD and this one is

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.950 
the this one is for AMD and this one is
for<00:04:33.729> Intel<00:04:35.789> Intel<00:04:36.960> AMD<00:04:37.960> intel<00:04:38.380> AMD<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:40.599> then

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
for Intel Intel AMD intel AMD and then

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.180 
for Intel Intel AMD intel AMD and then
you<00:04:41.050> get<00:04:41.169> this<00:04:41.380> little<00:04:41.650> thing<00:04:44.070> that'll<00:04:45.070> be

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
you get this little thing that'll be

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.890 
you get this little thing that'll be
honest<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.729> no<00:04:45.820> clue<00:04:46.240> what<00:04:46.449> this<00:04:46.599> thing<00:04:46.870> is

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
honest I have no clue what this thing is

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.750 
honest I have no clue what this thing is
for<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:49.440> think<00:04:50.440> maybe<00:04:50.919> use<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.460> if<00:04:51.550> you're

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
for I think maybe use it if you're

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.610 
for I think maybe use it if you're
installing<00:04:52.090> on<00:04:52.330> intel<00:04:52.870> or<00:04:53.020> something<00:04:53.380> I

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
installing on intel or something I

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.219 
installing on intel or something I
really<00:04:54.039> don't<00:04:54.220> know<00:04:54.370> all<00:04:55.060> i<00:04:55.120> know<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:58.169> when<00:04:59.169> I

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
really don't know all i know is when I

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.870 
really don't know all i know is when I
was<00:04:59.349> inside<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.710> my<00:04:59.770> buddy<00:04:59.979> system<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.520> wasn't

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
was inside of my buddy system it wasn't

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.629 
was inside of my buddy system it wasn't
working<00:05:01.030> wasn't<00:05:01.599> working<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:03.070> go<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.400> look

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
working wasn't working so I go I look

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.790 
working wasn't working so I go I look
online<00:05:03.849> nobody's<00:05:04.479> saying<00:05:04.780> jack<00:05:05.139> about<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.500> and

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
online nobody's saying jack about it and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040 
online nobody's saying jack about it and
then<00:05:06.460> I<00:05:06.580> go<00:05:06.759> what<00:05:07.060> if<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.330> take<00:05:07.599> this<00:05:07.810> little

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
then I go what if I take this little

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.260 
then I go what if I take this little
plastic<00:05:08.500> piece<00:05:08.949> of<00:05:09.159> crap<00:05:09.400> off<00:05:09.639> there's<00:05:10.000> not

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
plastic piece of crap off there's not

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.210 
plastic piece of crap off there's not
satellite<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.259> then<00:05:11.409> it<00:05:11.560> installed<00:05:12.009> just

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
satellite and then it installed just

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.330 
satellite and then it installed just
fine<00:05:12.490> so<00:05:12.789> this<00:05:13.169> little<00:05:14.169> thing<00:05:14.740> this<00:05:14.919> little

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
fine so this little thing this little

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.689 
fine so this little thing this little
piece<00:05:15.759> of<00:05:15.970> plastic<00:05:16.419> ring<00:05:16.690> is<00:05:17.280> what<00:05:18.280> prevents

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
piece of plastic ring is what prevents

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.189 
piece of plastic ring is what prevents
you from<00:05:18.849> installing<00:05:19.330> on<00:05:19.630> an<00:05:19.750> Intel<00:05:20.020> just

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
you from installing on an Intel just

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.960 
you from installing on an Intel just
don't<00:05:20.470> use<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.979> all<00:05:21.340> your<00:05:21.520> problems<00:05:21.880> are

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
don't use it and all your problems are

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.159 
don't use it and all your problems are
something<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.949> then<00:05:24.099> last<00:05:24.490> we<00:05:24.820> give<00:05:25.180> out<00:05:25.690> more

something and then last we give out more

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.790 
something and then last we give out more
of<00:05:26.349> the<00:05:27.659> resistance<00:05:28.659> box<00:05:28.960> or<00:05:29.169> whether<00:05:29.320> or<00:05:29.560> so

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
of the resistance box or whether or so

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.270 
of the resistance box or whether or so
