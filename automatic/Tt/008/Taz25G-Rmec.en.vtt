world right now we're looking at the
application<00:02:23.450> view<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:24.950> were<00:02:25.280> running<00:02:25.459> an

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
application view so we were running an

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.380 
application view so we were running an
application<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:27.020> would<00:02:27.170> show<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:28.150> after<00:02:29.150> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
application it would show up after a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.530 
application it would show up after a
livin<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:31.489> can<00:02:31.670> also<00:02:31.850> see<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:33.130> broader<00:02:34.150> see<00:02:35.150> you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
livin you can also see a broader see you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380 
livin you can also see a broader see you
could<00:02:35.720> pop<00:02:36.709> out<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.920> view<00:02:37.370> who<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.150> mesh

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
could pop out to view who is on the mesh

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.880 
could pop out to view who is on the mesh
with<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.020> if<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.230> had<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> room<00:02:39.620> full<00:02:39.830> of

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
just a sample of other applications that

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.789 
just a sample of other applications that
