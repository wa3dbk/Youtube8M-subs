00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.490
 Y 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.840
 we give several months of the marathon coffee and 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.430
 we want to hear the opinion of some 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.829
 runners who are going to go for the first time 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
 looking to conquer the 42 kilometers 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.219
 for that more guests to marta and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.169
 Ricardo, we want you not to know a little 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.610
 that motivated them to run the distance of 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.200
 42 kilometers 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.629
 - The truth is that I just have a 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.579
 year running and I've seen during this 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.579
 year as I have been improving I like the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.740
 running began to run 510 kilometers 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.140
 I dared to do 21 and I enjoyed it 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.190
 so much that I said because in the 40s and 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.860
 surcharges of the accounts because 42 kilos 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.980
 because it is a risk 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.970
 I have already run it 21 km times 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.079
 and I plan to do it here and outside too 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.140
 perfect and a question because the 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.250
 marathon because choose to play 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.170
 specifically good the truth is that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.330
 I wanted this first challenge was in my 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.580
 country because if I want to also do it in 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.710
 this other marathons were but first 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.660
 I wanted to try at home that the marathon that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.330
 they say that strong is referential and good 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.700
 have in my country I should start with the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.040
 mercardo because to touch because it's 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.040
 being recognized in South America 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:40.360
 it is expected that you are looking 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.360
 experiences first and get 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.039
 arrive in any way and if you can 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.039
 in less than 4 volts 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.799
 a marathon of 42 km is a great challenge is 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.840
 the great distance requires training 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.970
 it takes time dedication 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.099
 I want to understand a little knowing that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.930
 the bridge as you are 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.849
 preparing for the caf marathon as 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.140
 they are starting that training if 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.420
 someone is supporting them to the new 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.220
 coach and how is the typical routine of 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.319
 what are you doing a good week 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 I am part of a club, I run 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.099
 with the games run is we have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.080
 with a training plan twice a 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.239
 the week we have an expert coach 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.299
 bar and we leave them running 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.950
 preparing for 41 for 21 in 41 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.470
 kilometers we have a training plan 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.530
 for me I train every day of the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.530
 week with a training plan and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.080
 also feeding if we have a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.580
 planning with level 2 and I've had 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.400
 than learning to do the workouts 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.849
 double so many effectively Tuesday and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 Thursday or robert leave at 5 45 from the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.959
 tomorrow and then I have wants to take out 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.900
 so I had to get used to 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.670
 go to bed early to eat the loads of 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.410
 carbohydrates like me the trustee 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.459
 It changes your life because you have to 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.459
 organize yourself in a way 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.440
 and Ricardo as he is doing for the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.500
 training how are you preparing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.430
 for that great challenge of the marathon what good 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.620
 it's a hard training are five days 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.620
 a week tuesday thursday and sunday 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.130
 does hard training and on Wednesdays 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.920
 and Friday is done with funds but 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.290
 getting mileage and doing 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.290
 repetition exercises 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.780
 Y 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.910
 42 km a great network martha ricardo here 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.320
 ltm 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.300
 or at least they respect that 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.340
 distance than you do right now 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.050
 be the first time that they are going to run I have 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.080
 respect for that distance and the marathon 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.270
 of 42 but well I think I see and what 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.830
 that I've heard from your classmates and have 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.560
 made 42 kilometers you have to be 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.380
 physically very prepared with on the 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.300
 respect and I do not necessarily have all 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.090
 the physical conditions but good I have 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.040
 a plan for that but I respect a lot that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 you have to have is a lot of mind because 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.420
 in which part that marathon is more mental and 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.060
 let's say you are what most fear 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.670
 I have that at some time so much 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.830
 running because I just do not know if the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.670
 mind plays a trick on you and that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.710
 do not finish the race of ricardo 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.000
 that to fear for all 42 kilometers yes 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.590
 is that he has something else 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.590
 at kilometer 30 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.529
 and how are you going to prepare to move from 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.239
 that couple does not think about it 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.239
 remember for the 42 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.690
 we hope that the story of marta and 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.340
 Ricardo was the first to 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.860
 motivate them to encourage themselves to run 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.180
 the 42 kilometers either in the house in 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.700
 caracas or in any of the cities 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.860
 of Latin America but also that the 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.910
 doubts about it and even the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.980
 recommendations that they have given 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.900
 based on his short experience in the 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.880
 marathon will also inspire you to 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.870
 follow that path and run the marathon 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.870
 of 48
