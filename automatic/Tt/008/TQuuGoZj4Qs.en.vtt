problem with my apartment complex that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.270 
problem with my apartment complex that
we've<00:01:20.330> got<00:01:20.600> you<00:01:20.899> know<00:01:21.020> external<00:01:21.770> noise<00:01:21.920> that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
we've got you know external noise that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.430 
we've got you know external noise that
comes<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.700> our<00:01:23.180> air<00:01:23.600> conditioning<00:01:24.050> is<00:01:24.170> really

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
comes in our air conditioning is really

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.029 
comes in our air conditioning is really
loud<00:01:24.649> we've<00:01:24.950> got<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.399> loud<00:01:26.300> fridge<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:27.860> this

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
loud we've got a loud fridge and so this

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.040 
loud we've got a loud fridge and so this
is<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.220> way<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.729> use<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.420> microphones

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
is a way we can use the microphones

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.130 
is a way we can use the microphones
without<00:01:30.619> having<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.190> basically<00:01:32.149> eliminate

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
without having to basically eliminate

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.090
