00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.350 
yet because of the fact that there are
so<00:00:10.469> many<00:00:10.590> tiebreaker<00:00:11.219> scenarios<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.210> were

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
so many tiebreaker scenarios we were

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.120 
so many tiebreaker scenarios we were
initially<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.259> run<00:00:13.469> through<00:00:13.769> them<00:00:13.980> with

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
initially going to run through them with

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.890 
initially going to run through them with
you<00:00:14.160> but<00:00:14.670> there's<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:14.969> many<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.780> bit

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
you but there's so many it's a bit

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.120 
you but there's so many it's a bit
difficult<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> keep<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.800> what<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.039> going

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
difficult to keep up so what we're going

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.620 
difficult to keep up so what we're going
to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> explain<00:00:17.730> what<00:00:18.000> happens<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
to do is explain what happens in the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.019 
to do is explain what happens in the
event<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.560> tie<00:00:19.740> breaker<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
event of a tie breaker so if we have a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.120 
event of a tie breaker so if we have a
three-way<00:00:21.449> tie<00:00:21.630> tomorrow<00:00:22.140> between<00:00:22.710> any<00:00:23.039> three

meetings<00:01:11.490> tiebreakers<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.659> likely<00:01:13.020> yeah<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
meetings tiebreakers very likely yeah a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
meetings tiebreakers very likely yeah a
point<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> clarification<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> three-way

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
point of clarification on the three-way

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
point of clarification on the three-way
tie<00:01:15.420> by<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.409> team<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> won<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
tie by the way is the team that won the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
tie by the way is the team that won the
fastest<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.030> when<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.390> gets<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.110> if

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
fastest is when it gets the by there if

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.590 
fastest is when it gets the by there if
I<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.890> 20<00:01:20.580> 1102<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I you see if it's 20 1102 in the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.640 
I you see if it's 20 1102 in the
round-robin<00:01:21.810> you've<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> automatic

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
round-robin you've got the automatic

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
round-robin you've got the automatic
seeding<00:01:22.890> 11<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> line<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> fastest<00:01:24.570> win

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
seeding 11 down the line the fastest win

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420
