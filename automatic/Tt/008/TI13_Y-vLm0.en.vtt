 again with all of you and 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.429
 welcome to the first video of the channel 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.870

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.070
 that the truth guys I come to tell you 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.589
 a couple of little things of the game in this 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.210
 first gameplay that good simply is 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.250
 one that implies knowing in depth about the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.700
 game I've been testing it between last night 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 and this morning in a boys as I say is 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.550
 a piece of game and had enough 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.680
 eager to play it and in fact last night 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.900
 I was testing it with Ivan forever at 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.280
 last night and the truth that super 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.050
 super happy with him 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.080
 had seen how little of him from 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.750
 that was presented year and peak in the e3 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.880
 Well, I've had enough of this 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.940
 game and how had it come out 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.110
 exclusively for xbox 360 and xbox one 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 I have not had the opportunity yet 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.090
 to try it then as it has already come out 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.680
 for pc does it already seems to me that a 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.110
 month or so I was going to leave soon 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.060
 the concrete is going to be on Thursday it's going to 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.300
 leave for playstation 4 then when not 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.380
 we are talking gta colleagues 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.910
 iv all these things we have 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.579
 talking about it and in the end we're going to buy it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.059
 all to extract oslo to the channel all 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 in agreement 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.410
 first of all tell you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.720
 I'm doing this video because if 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.120
 you want to try it now in origin 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 origin is the sign when knowing is like 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.890
 the steam 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.870
 then you have it free until next 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 August 25th day of agreement up 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.400
 next day August 25 quite 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.530
 Free is a test that you will be able to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 play with him for 72 hours during 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.190
 three days is worth the time when 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.260
 start playing the first time it will start 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.990
 to count that time and good as I say what 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.280
 you can download until August 25 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 down in the description go to the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.479
 link the link to the page of the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.280
 origin where you can download 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.960
 the rust if you do not have it create an account 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.399
 if you do not have it properly downloaded it is the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.830
 game directly from there is worth what 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 you have as I say below in the description 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.180
 He also took the opportunity to say what 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 is what we do that if you like what you try 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.080
 If you like work, you have also 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.910
 described in a second link in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 voters passed the page on which 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.619
 It seems to me that there are about two 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 ending now are eighteen euros more 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.759
 or less on the official page in the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.160
 own page of origin is worth 30 euros 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.930
 so the offer is not bad 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.100
 that as I say in the description you will have 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.810
 so much the link for what 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.030
 Free good for you to try it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 free during those three days and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.240
 if you like it then you buy it in the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
 second page that I leave in the second 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.020
 link for about half of your 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.000
 official agreement price is one page 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.860
 totally safe is g2 to that all the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 good world that many people because the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.540
 knows and is used a lot so 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.330
 nothing guys I hope you like the idea 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 to upload this game that good of that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.130
 I'm not going to play practically never I 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.380
 just because good is a game that the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.330
 I really recommend playing with friends 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.140
 because it's really like what happens super 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.180
 well as you can see it is a game that is like 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.620
 you know as very very colorful although the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 departure at night that also the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.370
 maps influences whether it's daytime and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.160
 night is super super cool is also 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.650
 from this point and as I say is a game 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.780
 that in principle I'm going to go up with friends 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.160
 ok I do not know how the issue of power goes 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.960
 invite people because the truth 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.430
 now going I've used it a lot like that 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.810
 good and I'll see little by little 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.010
 see if I can invite teapot people 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.990
 etcetera as I say can you tell me in 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.120
 the comments that you think this game 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.010
 if I will play it if you have played it 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.740
 you intend to play it or if 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.700
 simply because aesthetics like what 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.370
 you want to try 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.470
 I insist you have the two links below 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 both for the test and to buy it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.730
 if you finally like and want 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.590
 buy it as I say surely the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.720
 we give the insurance I will have it for 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.190
 playstation 4 and if I encourage you encourage me 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.330
 you surely also what 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.849
 complete the playstation 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.489
 the station itself stops for pc because 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.560
 for 16 17 euros that costs then the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.670
 true that it's worth it so nothing 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.200

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.019

 more with him with the creative as you see me 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.690
 I've gone right to the part where 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.610
 there were the enemies and in the end I 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.930
 they ended up killing but well I hope that 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.340

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.410
