kind of just you got to get a feel for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.109 
kind of just you got to get a feel for
every<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.040> wherever<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.429> want<00:01:05.579> to<00:01:05.639> go<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.999> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
every or wherever you want to go but you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.109 
every or wherever you want to go but you
may<00:01:06.299> basically<00:01:06.929> want<00:01:07.079> to<00:01:07.139> have<00:01:07.289> two<00:01:07.560> guys

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
may basically want to have two guys

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
may basically want to have two guys
holding<00:01:09.119> down<00:01:09.210> each<00:01:09.509> side<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.139> they<00:01:10.259> don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
holding down each side so they don't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
holding down each side so they don't
come<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.889> doors<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.090> kill<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
come through the doors and kill all you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
come through the doors and kill all you
and<00:01:13.679> then<00:01:13.889> the<00:01:13.950> worst<00:01:14.130> case<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.579> you<00:01:14.609> have<00:01:14.880> only

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
and then the worst case if you have only

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.809 
and then the worst case if you have only
one<00:01:15.749> guy<00:01:16.499> left<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:17.100> whatever<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.670> guys

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
one guy left or whatever or two guys

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:18.949 
one guy left or whatever or two guys
left<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.179> can<00:01:18.329> just<00:01:18.450> run<00:01:18.569> a<00:01:18.600> rape<00:01:18.780> train

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
left you can just run a rape train

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.809 
left you can just run a rape train
around<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.319> giant<00:01:19.649> rock<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> middle<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
around the giant rock in the middle so

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.959 
around the giant rock in the middle so
that's<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.179> best<00:01:21.359> strategy<00:01:21.569> I<00:01:22.079> can<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
that's the best strategy I can think of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.429 
that's the best strategy I can think of
in<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.149> biodome<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.899> also<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.259> same

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

want there's a lot of places the rape
train<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.600> solo<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:43.799> easy<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.429> run<00:01:44.609> a

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
train so solo is probably easy to run a

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.709 
train so solo is probably easy to run a
rape<00:01:44.880> train<00:01:45.029> if<00:01:45.179> you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.359> how<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.569> do<00:01:45.689> that

rape train if you know how to do that

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.179 
rape train if you know how to do that
and<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.679> where<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:46.950> talking<00:01:47.130> about

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and this is where I was talking about

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.399 
and this is where I was talking about
the<00:01:47.369> half<00:01:47.549> wall<00:01:47.819> I<00:01:48.060> come<00:01:48.749> over<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> half<00:01:49.170> wall

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the half wall I come over that half wall

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.019 
the half wall I come over that half wall
so<00:01:49.560> my<00:01:49.709> job<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.219> basically<00:01:50.579> hold<00:01:50.909> down

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.029 
so my job is which basically hold down

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.309 
so my job is which basically hold down
that<00:01:51.060> Apple<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:51.719> make<00:01:51.840> sure<00:01:51.869> what<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.259> was

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
that Apple and make sure what it was

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.919 
that Apple and make sure what it was
alright<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.029> this<00:01:54.029> is<00:01:54.179> this<00:01:54.389> is<00:01:54.509> probably<00:01:54.749> the

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
alright but this is this is probably the

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.289 
alright but this is this is probably the
best<00:01:55.170> idea<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.069> i<00:01:56.099> can<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.909> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
best idea that i can think of at this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
best idea that i can think of at this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
here so that's a definite

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.180 
plus it will not always be here
obviously<00:02:16.299> but<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.989> lot<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> times<00:02:17.920> it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
obviously but a lot of the times it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.100 
obviously but a lot of the times it
comes<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.819> here<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.209> that's<00:02:19.390> definitely<00:02:20.049> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
comes up here and that's definitely a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.890

actually have to a mystery box that
could<00:02:34.269> possibly<00:02:34.629> be<00:02:34.720> up<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.049> as<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.260> can

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
could possibly be up there as you can

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.530 
could possibly be up there as you can
get<00:02:35.500> guns<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.010> then<00:02:36.129> a<00:02:36.159> perk<00:02:36.579> that's<00:02:37.209> useful

and the perk mule is definitely useful

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.410 
and the perk mule is definitely useful
because<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.730> could<00:02:39.879> go<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.060> mystery<00:02:40.299> box

need<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.909> do<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.629> need<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.900> able<00:02:46.959> to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
this strategy is that teleporter is
