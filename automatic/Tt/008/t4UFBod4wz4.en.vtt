00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
it along this part here and a little bit

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.789 
it along this part here and a little bit
where<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> Sun<00:02:59.810> may<00:03:00.019> hit<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.439> which<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.769> of

where the Sun may hit in which one of
you<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.129> always<00:03:01.280> make<00:03:01.519> sure<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.819> shake<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.120> up

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
you is always make sure you shake it up

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.110 
you is always make sure you shake it up
because<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.249> is<00:03:04.340> really<00:03:04.519> good<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.879> you<00:03:04.969> want

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
because it is really good and you want

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.970 
because it is really good and you want
to<00:03:05.239> mix<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:09.170> I'm<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.409> going<00:03:09.499> to<00:03:09.590> use<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
to mix it and I'm just going to use the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.110 
to mix it and I'm just going to use the
map<00:03:10.249> rush<00:03:14.439> there's<00:03:15.439> always<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.340> cap<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.790> I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
map rush there's always in the cap and I

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.300 
map rush there's always in the cap and I
find<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.599> in<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.049> cap<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.560> usually<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.159> will

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
find that in the cap is usually it will

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.709 
find that in the cap is usually it will
suffice<00:03:19.519> for<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:22.639> I<00:03:22.670> think<00:03:22.760> because<00:03:23.420> this

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:23.719 
suffice for but I think because this

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.179 
suffice for but I think because this
brush<00:03:24.079> just<00:03:24.319> going<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.620> add<00:03:24.769> just<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:25.159> little

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
brush just going to add just a little

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.160

bit<00:03:26.499> to<00:03:27.499> the<00:03:27.620> cap<00:03:27.829> here<00:03:28.450> where<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.540> get<00:03:30.019> my

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
bit to the cap here where I can get my

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.259 
bit to the cap here where I can get my
brush<00:03:30.409> in<00:03:30.439> there<00:03:31.269> nice<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.299> easy<00:03:34.090> okay<00:03:35.090> and
