these nice nice crystal-clear door
speakers<00:00:30.530> got<00:00:31.530> the<00:00:31.650> two<00:00:31.800> tweeters<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.369> front

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
speakers got the two tweeters up front

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
speakers got the two tweeters up front
and<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.510> they're<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.870> four<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and I think they're two four and a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
and I think they're two four and a
half's<00:00:34.560> I<00:00:34.770> believe<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.579> doors<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.350> then

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
half's I believe and the doors and then

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.060 
half's I believe and the doors and then
in<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:40.730> there's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.880> amplifier<00:00:43.070> just

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
in the back there's a amplifier just

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850 
in the back there's a amplifier just
off-center<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> left<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:46.320> powers<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
off-center to the left that powers the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.430 
off-center to the left that powers the
bass<00:00:47.070> separately<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> couple

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
bass separately and there's a couple

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
bass separately and there's a couple
woofers<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:54.530> six<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.950> six<00:00:56.130> by<00:00:56.250> nine<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
woofers and six or six by nine is I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.979 
woofers and six or six by nine is I
think<00:00:56.880> there's<00:00:57.030> six<00:00:57.180> by<00:00:57.329> eight<00:00:57.360> stuff<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
think there's six by eight stuff I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
think there's six by eight stuff I
remember<00:00:58.890> correctly<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.950> they<00:01:01.950> stay<00:01:02.160> crystal

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
remember correctly and they stay crystal

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
remember correctly and they stay crystal
clear<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.600> deck<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.049> isn't<00:01:04.259> anything

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
clear the the deck really isn't anything

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
clear the the deck really isn't anything
special<00:01:05.009> but<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.309> balances<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.090> sound

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
special but it balances out the sound

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.289 
special but it balances out the sound
nicely<00:01:06.870> when<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> crank<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.010> real<00:01:08.250> loud<00:01:08.370> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
nicely when you crank it up real loud it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
nicely when you crank it up real loud it
doesn't<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> where<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.620> bass<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
doesn't get to where all bass and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
doesn't get to where all bass and
nothing<00:01:11.670> else<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.450> balances<00:01:12.750> itself

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
nothing else it actually balances itself

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.719 
nothing else it actually balances itself
out<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.040> still<00:01:14.280> having<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.610> lot

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
out to where you're still having a lot

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.990 
out to where you're still having a lot
of<00:01:14.850> bass<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> same<00:01:16.500> time<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> lot

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of bass but at the same time doing a lot

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.430 
of bass but at the same time doing a lot
of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> highs<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.420> everything<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> stays

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
of the highs and everything it stays

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.920 
of the highs and everything it stays
crystal<00:01:19.860> clear<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.280> max<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
crystal clear you can max it out and it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500 
crystal clear you can max it out and it
actually<00:01:22.440> will<00:01:22.860> limit<00:01:23.280> itself<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:24.180> point

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
actually will limit itself to a point

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.330 
actually will limit itself to a point
where<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> won't<00:01:24.869> blow<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.440> factory<00:01:25.830> speakers

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
where it won't blow the factory speakers

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
where it won't blow the factory speakers
and<00:01:26.780> yet<00:01:27.780> it'll<00:01:27.990> still<00:01:28.200> hit<00:01:28.380> pretty<00:01:28.619> hard

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and yet it'll still hit pretty hard

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.310 
and yet it'll still hit pretty hard
Oh<00:01:29.689> see<00:01:30.689> here

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.680 

this<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.470> not<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.950> base<00:01:37.250> sensitive<00:01:38.090> microphone

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
this is not a base sensitive microphone

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.380 
this is not a base sensitive microphone
so<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.800> might<00:01:40.190> sound<00:01:40.610> like<00:01:40.790> crap<00:01:41.090> when<00:01:41.120> it

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
so it might sound like crap when it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.440 
so it might sound like crap when it
actually<00:01:41.570> comes<00:01:41.870> up<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.770> video<00:01:43.400> but<00:01:44.330> I'm

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
