00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.200
Hello Friends! Today we will make a vegan cheese or almond paste

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.120
or spreadable paste, whatever you want to call

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.820
It's a recipe that we loved, is an easy and simple recipe

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.529
with very few ingredients, and the truth that is all you have in the house

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.480
So let me show  the ingredients and then the method

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.739
The ingredients are:

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.519
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.920
1/4 teaspoon paprika 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.780
1/4 teaspoon curry and 1/4 teaspoon oregano

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.040
This is what we have left of almond milk

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.140
We have a video where we show how to make almond milk

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
because you see here that are obviously peeled almonds

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.370
and this, what we have left with this will form the cream cheese

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.910
we will use also pepper
freshly ground beans

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.070
salt

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.450
and one half of the lemon juice

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.240
Friends, the preparation is as follows:

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.370
in the bowl where we have the almond paste

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.160
put seasonings, salt, freshly ground pepper

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.150
put the juice of half a lemon

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.630
and integrate well with a spoon

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.030
until all ingredients are well mixed

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.420
this, as we said, is ideal for greasing the pan

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.200
and so can be used in foods, such as in potatoes

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.880
or any other preparation in which you want

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.880
try this cream cheese or almond paste

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.450
and enjoy it because you'll love it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.530
Well friends, I hope you liked this recipe, we loved

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.490
obviously we make suggestions as to the dressing to be placed

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.599
this cream cheese or almond paste,

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.699
is a suggestion to us, the truth is not only rich with bread

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.999
but also, we'll put a cooked potatoes, for example, and also became very rich.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:27.999
This  cheese last for  2-3 days in the refrigerator, the truth is a small amount, so if you are lucky

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.339
they can last one day or two

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.979
