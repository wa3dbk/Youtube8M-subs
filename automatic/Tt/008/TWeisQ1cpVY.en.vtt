00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.179
 idea tool to say for you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.100
 your socks 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.080
 say it easier to put on your socks 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.109
 can attract older people and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.000
 for people with luc laughed 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.000
 so this thought 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.300
 this figured out and a tool where you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.840
 so say you pull tight over it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.280
 that shows you okay busy 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 linnaeus again 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:46.320
 so your package so the device and it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.780
 reciteers say a sock over it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.780
 if yes 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.660
 I say this as 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.650
 the bag pulled over this 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.800
 tool device and so I leave now 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.790
 let's see that you get a little easier 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.790
 that draw cancer 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.130
 otherwise I would be your foot 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.229
 i would go up 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:29.249
 and then it would take him out 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.249
 and there is also supposed to be behind 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 together we idea should definitely you what 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.880
 be changed 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:46.929
 cuff that the right direction so still 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.770
 see it again 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.770
 okay so off 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.349
 when this device 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.840
 watch out over it with the hook to 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.840
 down like that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.259
 and this would go 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.030
 we are 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.960
 yes you did attract socks 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.220
 keep me at a point and know and is something 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.860
 he would put your foot in it and then I pull 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.110
 careful with that willoughby device 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:38.110
 goes up and I would very much 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 pin machine I had a spin so you had that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 and sit that sock 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:52.840
 smartphone yes so threaded rod of 10 i 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.670
 so I also have a 5c with tom and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.490
 done or allow it to be smooth 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.080
 that is also said but led over it 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.890
 still with your foot and your legs that you don't 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.890
 you decorate 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:13.150
 all right 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:16.900
 has had so much out and about 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.900
 but typically oxal 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.850
 about this idea and now it's shock again 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.590
 cell and what I turn on 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.760
 would you have to get in and pull me with that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.760
 shock and that opened the dialogue 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.710
 show and the city 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.920
 shut and he sees 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.830
 only now to count 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.770
 so tool to put on your sock 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.160
 for those with back problems 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.160
 older ones 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.570
 the summary one again I need some here 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.010
 to change you improve because I 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.550
 So think again about something 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.550
 to think 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.040
 that was it
