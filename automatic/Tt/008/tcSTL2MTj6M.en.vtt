00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.380 
rifle you're going to want to complete
the<00:00:42.470> ignitions<00:00:42.950> on<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.280> map<00:00:43.489> called<00:00:43.790> criminal

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.870 
the ignitions on the map called criminal
convoys<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.010> now<00:00:46.160> I've<00:00:46.430> done<00:00:46.460> these<00:00:46.850> before

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
convoys and now I've done these before

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.030 
convoys and now I've done these before
in<00:00:47.420> my<00:00:47.510> video<00:00:47.810> and<00:00:47.960> this<00:00:48.050> was<00:00:48.230> hard<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.530> get<00:00:48.620> XP

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040

in my video and this was hard to get XP
now<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:49.520> probably<00:00:49.640> one<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.090> best

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
now this is probably one of the best

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.810 
now this is probably one of the best
ways<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.420> get<00:00:50.720> XP<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.220> you<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:52.489> want<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.670> go

you'd have to try and kill him but yeah

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.289 
you'd have to try and kill him but yeah
as<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.409> said<00:01:33.890> just<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.580> need<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.850> get<00:01:35.090> behind

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
as I said just you need to get behind

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.100 
as I said just you need to get behind
cover<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.259> that's<00:01:36.680> why<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:36.950> attack<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.820> car

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
cover and that's why I attack the car

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.810 
cover and that's why I attack the car
after<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> first<00:01:39.469> car<00:01:39.740> because<00:01:40.070> then<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.549> kind

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
after the first car because then it kind

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.600 
after the first car because then it kind
of<00:01:40.939> creates<00:01:41.360> some<00:01:41.539> cover<00:01:42.250> focus<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.430> you're

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
of creates some cover focus is you're

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.429 
of creates some cover focus is you're
probably<00:01:43.850> best<00:01:44.240> friend<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:44.960> because<00:01:45.259> you

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
probably best friend in this because you

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.039 
probably best friend in this because you
need<00:01:45.590> focus<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.340> actually<00:01:46.759> kill<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.630> guys<00:01:47.810> now

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
need focus to actually kill the guys now

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.380 
need focus to actually kill the guys now
and<00:01:48.289> you<00:01:49.009> just<00:01:49.159> need<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.369> kill<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.820> guy<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:50.210> it

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
show you an example of actually how to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.930

possible<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.130> said<00:02:43.370> they<00:02:43.610> do<00:02:43.670> get

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
possible so like I said they do get

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.430 
possible so like I said they do get
harder<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.510> they<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.840> on

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
harder as they go on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.080 
harder as they go on
and<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.220> that's<00:02:46.490> probably<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.880> biggest

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
and that that's probably the biggest

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.790 
and that that's probably the biggest
