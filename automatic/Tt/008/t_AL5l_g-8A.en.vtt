00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.070
 soon a good taxi can 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.960
 he will not be able to boast and we them 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.590
 with the most modern 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.059
 without a driver Russian scientists 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.459
 took up the development of unmanned vehicles 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.309
 domestic viburnum without passengers 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.530
 cutting circles on parking first 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.390
 impression 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.670
 the driver left and forgot to put the car on 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.849
 the handbrake is much more complicated 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.919
 This is a test of the first full 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.539
 russian car 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 drone drone 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.859
 car basically 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
 and today and even more so in the future he 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.640
 surely must 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.550
 uniquely independently 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.660
 respond to those conditions 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 independence 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690
 party or even 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.080
 the price of ill-mannered drivers and already 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.590
 today in its functional 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.890
 opportunities 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.350
 reacts faster to the situation 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 making decisions helps the car 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.100
 navigation 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.399
 and 5 video cameras on the roof of the computer 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.680
 analyzes all traffic information 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 marks and markup movement neighbors 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 flow and gives commands and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.050
 mechanical systems had to 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 automates fate 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.510
 is she major or 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.680
 mechanical car 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.050
 for these purposes we have established 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.800
 there was no yes 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.969
 which controls 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.969
 brake system 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.440
 further gas which switches 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.700
 gear box 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 inside the car 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.230
 the robot feel uncomfortable especially on 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.440
 driving place get used to the fact that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.250
 the steering wheel and the gear lever are moving 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.650
 not easy all the time 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.730
 I wanted to participate in 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.630
 control so as not to interfere with the car I 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.900
 came up with another occupation which 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.400
 conventional cars are simply impossible 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 the driver finally does not have to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.640
 install roadside cafes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.929
 have a cup of coffee 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.929
 it will be possible and driving 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.770
 however, the ability to steer cars themselves 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.670
 equipped with autopilot will not 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 really completely unattended computer 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.520
 man will not leave give kabule only 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 before the first mistakes 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.500
 in case of detection of incorrect actions 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.780
 the driver 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.720
 this system warns in 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.469
 If the driver does not change 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.489
 driving system 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.199
 Auto mode is enabled 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.009
 the guys took over 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.839
 it turns out like a driving test 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.170
 you are constantly monitored by the inspector 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.130
 at first it can level but early 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 or later drivers cry the throne 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.120
 Mentor will get used and begin to observe 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.989
 road rules on a hundred 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.200
 percent only parents that result 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.890
 autopilot need to be installed as 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.790
 mandatory system on all cars
