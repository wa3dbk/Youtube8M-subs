00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.889
 and alexis at this moment sings to us 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:05.889
 women 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.730
 so the accent I do not know who we 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:28.280
 I see is the favor had to be God 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.280
 so alone and certainly I think so then 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.480
 like a rib would have given me 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.480
 backbone of the gait 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.749
 it can be love 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.380
 if bolt is back 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.700
 and live on the moon 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.700
 there would be more astronauts to do evil 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.670
 from which space and stories come out 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.200
 not only because it was put in this place 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.930
 women 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.140
 what they ask us to be able 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.570
 if we can not, it does not exist and if it does not exist 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.540
 we invented it for you never 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.210
 and I would have written neruda that there was 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.210
 painted picasso but if it did not exist 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 sorry 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.740
 what a power asks us 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.740
 if it does not exist 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.130
 for you women 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 I would have written neruda 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.579
 I had painted my case if not 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.579
 we exist 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 and so it is presented at the academy ten 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.630
 years with this theme that all women 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.330
 of the skittle are burning with emotion 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.470
 similar gallant july all of which 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.320
 exists when exists 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.770
 I'm glad to see that you accepted the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.840
 challenge to change your gender a little 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.880
 well without reaching excellence this I 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.880
 I know it's not your thing, yours is another 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.280
 kind of music but I liked it and liked it 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 it's good that you accepted the challenge of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.850
 sing another kind of other kind of gender 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.510
 another genre and another type of song 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.510
 Congrats friend

 well accompanied tonight to all 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.930
 my archer ricardo seems to me one of the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.960
 best and most beautiful authors write 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 towards women in the world of music 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.740
 and the truth is that it has been a pleasure 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.690
 see you in another style of music that 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.300
 it was not the one you had you had us 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.040
 accustomed although I like you more 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.510
 in other genres I think you've done it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.260
 very good congratulations gods 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.260
 alexis 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.200
 I liked it a lot like you did 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.180
 you have a great voice and you can sing like 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.430
 I have always said any gender 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.440
 everywhere but I also want you to 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.239
 do you believe, this is what you can sing, I know 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.489
 that you love the rancher but this 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.110
 it can go amazing and any other 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.000
 ballad can also be wonderful 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.950
 because you have an incredible instrument and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.299
 very nice to the ear so 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 congratulations because it 's good 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.110
 he was very safe back 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.480
 I heard some detune details 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.459
 details for the same as you are that is 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
 a little bit outside of zone no but in 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.160
 I really like that you dare want 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.020
 really achieve to show that you are a 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.360
 great singer because you have a voice with 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.700
 a lot of strength is not but I would like 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.400
 what will focus is a little on what you 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.220
 like to do because you do it very well 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.810
 congratulations thank you very much alexis me 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.060
 I like that he has left your zone of 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 comfort even though in some 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.680
 moments I felt that rancher vibrato but 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.620
 I like I like that you risk me 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.330
 I like you to dare now enjoy it 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.459

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:25.350
 public is witness to it marta was a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:31.370
 7 already there you get 7 cruise gives you a 7 and 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.370
