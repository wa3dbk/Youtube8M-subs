whole wheat flour the texture of the
cake<00:01:01.129> will<00:01:01.489> differ<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.440> baking<00:01:03.440> powder<00:01:03.470> a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
cake will differ and baking powder a

cardamom and clothes to the carrot cake
to<00:01:17.200> add<00:01:17.380> additional<00:01:17.620> spice<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.730> flavor<00:01:18.760> to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
to add additional spice and flavor to

to add additional spice and flavor to
the<00:01:19.750> carrot<00:01:20.260> cake<00:01:20.470> now<00:01:20.680> I'm<00:01:20.740> gonna<00:01:20.950> sift<00:01:21.310> all

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the carrot cake now I'm gonna sift all

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.710 
the carrot cake now I'm gonna sift all
the<00:01:21.550> ingredients<00:01:22.150> together<00:01:22.350> using<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.590> sifter

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.330 

so<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.840> reason<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.260> sift<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.800> cake<00:01:29.980> is<00:01:30.190> so

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
so the reason we sift the cake is so

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.160 
so the reason we sift the cake is so
that<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> cake<00:01:30.790> develops<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.360> lot<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.630> air<00:01:31.870> and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that the cake develops a lot of air and

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.310 
that the cake develops a lot of air and
all<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.010> flour<00:01:33.430> also<00:01:33.700> gets<00:01:34.060> aired<00:01:34.300> out<00:01:34.570> and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
all the flour also gets aired out and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
all the flour also gets aired out and
it's<00:01:36.160> very<00:01:36.370> even<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:36.970> texture<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:38.080> that's<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.440> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it's very even in texture so that's it a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.370 
it's very even in texture so that's it a
next<00:01:40.180> step<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.660> add<00:01:40.810> all<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.229> wet

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
next step is to add all the wet

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.590 
next step is to add all the wet
ingredients<00:01:41.430> give<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.610> stir<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.060> put<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.510> in

loaf pan and pour the cake batter into
the<00:02:34.370> pan<00:02:34.579> so<00:02:35.090> let's<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.540> proceed<00:02:35.719> to<00:02:36.049> do<00:02:36.170> that

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
the pan so let's just proceed to do that

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.789 
the pan so let's just proceed to do that
so<00:02:37.359> into<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.480> cake<00:02:38.659> into<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.200> loaf<00:02:39.379> pan<00:02:39.439> I'm

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
so into the cake into the loaf pan I'm

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.580 
so into the cake into the loaf pan I'm
going<00:02:39.829> to<00:02:40.010> add<00:02:40.069> in<00:02:40.400> some<00:02:40.579> oil<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.379> make<00:02:42.379> sure

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
going to add in some oil and make sure

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.729 
going to add in some oil and make sure
that<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:42.889> spread<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.400> oil<00:02:43.430> evenly

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
that you spread the oil evenly

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.259 
that you spread the oil evenly
throughout<00:02:45.739> given<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.519> sides<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.120> pan

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
throughout given the sides of the pan

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.020 
throughout given the sides of the pan
once<00:02:47.900> we<00:02:48.079> grease<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.500> pan<00:02:48.709> we'll<00:02:49.489> add<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
once we grease the pan we'll add in the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.379 
once we grease the pan we'll add in the
flour

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
flour

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.410

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.280 

our<00:03:17.580> next<00:03:18.060> step<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.480> bake<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.959> carrot

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
