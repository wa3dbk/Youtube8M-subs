00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
stuff like that and it's definitely the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
stuff like that and it's definitely the
best<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.590> opinion<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.820> called

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
best one in my opinion and it's called

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
best one in my opinion and it's called
ice<00:00:36.180> cream<00:00:36.540> net<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.140> absolutely<00:00:37.379> free

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the ability to upgrade to a VIP so you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
the ability to upgrade to a VIP so you
do<00:00:42.720> have<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> restrictions<00:00:44.309> on

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
do have some kind of restrictions on

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.100 
do have some kind of restrictions on
that<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> whole<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.900> pretty

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that and but on the whole it's pretty

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
that and but on the whole it's pretty
good<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.440> use<00:00:46.650> so<00:00:47.220> what<00:00:47.400> it<00:00:47.519> actually<00:00:47.550> does<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
good to use so what it actually does is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
good to use so what it actually does is
allows<00:00:48.449> you<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.720> watch<00:00:48.809> movies<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.500> TV<00:00:49.830> shows

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
either download or just stream them

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.250 
either download or just stream them
straight<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.589> app<00:00:52.739> itself<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.900> has

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
straight to the app itself and it has

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.140 
straight to the app itself and it has
all<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> decent<00:00:56.400> shows<00:00:56.610> everything<00:00:56.909> you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
all the decent shows everything you

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.090 
all the decent shows everything you
would<00:00:57.269> kind<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.540> imagine<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.530> we're<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.920> free

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
would kind of imagine so we're for free

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700 
would kind of imagine so we're for free
it's<00:00:59.250> pretty<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.659> we<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.110> into

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it's pretty good so if we just go into

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.039 
it's pretty good so if we just go into
one<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.580> just<00:01:02.970> for<00:01:03.089> example<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.839> if<00:01:03.960> we

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
one of these just for example so if we

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.329 
one of these just for example so if we
just<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.320> back<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> top<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just go back up to the top to the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
just go back up to the top to the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
say download it or just watch it
straight<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.659> app<00:01:21.780> itself<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
straight from the app itself so you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.010
