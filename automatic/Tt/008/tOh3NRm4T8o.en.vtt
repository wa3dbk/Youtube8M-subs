00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.510
 people remember why today for the reading column but not without having 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.589
 signed 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.079
 to the fact an apprentice 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.670
 the Milan after last night at the top of the table and everything 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.700
 forced to standings and born there are 6 teams in 5 points think later 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.380
 eleven matches a team that is all theatrical and obviously 33 points 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.550
 nadia still only 23 and bay same class so he left 10 points around 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.460
 create even more. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.200
 the Lazio which has left the head of the ranking makes news but up to a certain point 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.330
 point in some ways predictable 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.040
 and on Sunday there is milan inter centerville in short, the derby 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.850
 the most interesting part 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.250
 netherlands and max favorite for the championship 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.140
 hey also favored for a discussion 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.179
 jeffrey restaurant satprem internet same what it means 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.810
 you play the game berlusconi fine box here is the text the two things are i 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.800
 mild foods risk of criminal aesthetics preserved to campaign 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.930
 electoral and it is no coincidence that this night is beautiful. has made spain map 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.079
 electoral 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.020
 re very popular very strong 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.180
 here because the Milan has in the head standings despite having a team 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 infantile figurines because cheerful coach is starting to distribute them 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.630
 otherwise for example when playing the accepted frame it plays in the shape of a heart 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.610
 they are not all metamorphosis compatible 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.930
 and this was nice of soccer the problem is that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
 while tremonti does not know how to make a financial because the money is not there 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.530
 dresses like reading in the newspapers the horns with the comments are 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.159
 five-a-side football games sometimes a week and everything is waiting for everyone 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.710
 January but who knows what purchases but where all this money takes them 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.840
 but how is it possible that this is a country where a minister of the economy 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.970
 does not have the money with the financial and all the rest in football if i 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.260
 members go great doesn't go great they are bluffing 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.440
 I read things to be connected as long as the citizen of. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.210
 don't put the two together probably continue to see the 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.059
 really appreciate 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:18.689
 I had said though that this is a reading column today ebay fineco a 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.689
 what pussy current I'm going to hear 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:27.409
 in series at ebit half of the managers are the first years of football then 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.719
 bdp influence scares 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.700
 amen that increase ancient experience only a few years ago there are those who said 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.860
 if you put yourself against us you don't kick you know where the brescia ends up 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.759
 interregional 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:42.909
 who says that 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.670
 those who said it exactly 6 years ago believe precisely 11 November 26 years ago 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.349
 12 round the president of Brescia Corioni 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.099
 the coach of Brescia yesterday complained after Brescia because Juventus 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.090
 after inter brescia brescia juventus 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.430
 certainly the referees did not treat the Brescians well what else he always says 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 the usual chorion not today in today's newspapers but as if it were today 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.339
 26 years ago 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.519
 when I see a referee like that of brescia juve trifo flattering I go 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.630
 crazy but short 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.630
 changing the order of product addends does not change how I stand 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.409
 Shut up 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.169
 after a minute that unites a player for a foul that is not even there 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.569
 it is 30 meters race that seemed to want to eat inverted parts is 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.719
 already so much if it gives me a punishment 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.079
 having a young team the boys already start playing with a little 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.069
 Of fear 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.499
 seeds warn 1 immediately after 40 sacuola seconds the fear becomes terror 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.799
 and then another 3 4 yellow cards 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.189
 in the middle of the first half while we played better than they thought 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.969
 we hope that the juve signs because otherwise signaled tro 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.039
 only on the ford server the time the game ended the referee was very good 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.110
 it is all the press against me because quotation marks was to keep close 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.169
 always inverting commas and this is a book released in 2006 before the stopover 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.719
 concomitantly oscar of soccer puma written before investigation on the football of the 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.850
 world '82 world 2006 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.160
 a generation of story characters emotion lie an exciting game 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.010
 turned into an industrial intrigue it's fine though. re that is turned into 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.940
 industrial refrigerators this has always been 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.050
 in the face of many of the arbitrages yesterday the coach of the Palermo era 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.520
 Delio Rossi said 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.699
 that of beech was not clear the life of a certain banti and exiled by a 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.050
 sure niki is all for all these certain of these figures are 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.900
 available and available to what is a poke buys in the head who can 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.050
 giving him satisfaction, therefore especially for the big teams, has always been successful 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.389
 now it happens in a bold way that happened in a brash way over the years 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.920
 you have or it happens now 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.010
 towards the cameras in particular in this case of the Milan 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.300
 more than the time of Milan 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.950
 delio rossi said -p suits literally little clear arbitrage 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.320
 that in the language of football as you will have understood from the quotation that I have you 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.370
 bed means these have stolen the game then in front of it all 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.699
 how we want to put it 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.990
 how we want to think about calciotto and all the rest 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.789
 name changed d 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.279
 fable exactly the same things as this country hasn't changed 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.119
 only those who put marcaccio to work in politics only get worse 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.659
 two things together
