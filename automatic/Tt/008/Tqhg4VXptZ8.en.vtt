00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:17.150
 Hi, there are games and electronics coming 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.039
 digital art and light people come to us 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 battlefield online radio will break with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.289
 the associated or closed game style 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.140
 button movie now does not fight the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.470
 crime in the busy and curious streets of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.290
 miami in full of adventurous action is 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 against the judge leon already explained 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.540
 the games movies and a whole imaginary not 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 signed with the crime 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 What I highlight in this game is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 the details are very well worked 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.649
 both in characters and scenarios 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.559
 both on the weapons and at the level of the audio 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.949
 is very adapted to the floods of the game and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.479
 everything in itself is very very well 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.750
 working in this game is fantastic 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.010
 The highlight plus the single player tone mode 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 A very catchy story is full 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.780
 action and as we play 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 Let's go up level and to go up level is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.060
 I need to arrest street criminals. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 from miami 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.390
 you need to act as if it were a zoom 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.880
 real police instead of killing the enemy 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.570
 we must at least try to learn the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 maximum possible limit thereby only 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.759
 that way we can climb higher 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.799
 hurry level and as you move up 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.049
 level 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.360
 we block new weapons 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 clothing equipment among 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.040
 other weapons 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.080
 What I can highlight even more 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.970
 as I said the charts are 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.530
 very good 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:16.510
 there is a concern in the in the mode 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 how built the year levels and can 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.819
 be air that lighting is very 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 for example a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.950
 level where it is a high time and Riva 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.860
 we are trying to fight with the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:36.160
 enemy this is not at all easy to do 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:41.440
 a game that I highlight in the negative 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.860
 in my opinion I think guns 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.510
 I've been playing for a long time in a game. 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.000
 of fps is apps terms this sensitivity 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.459
 when we play we need karma loads 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.209
 It is not as accurate as possible not to 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.940
 to be killed in this case I think 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.090
 there could be an option to evolve 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.790
 existing weapons there is an option 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.400
 to improve weapons, but there is no 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.209
 option to evolve for example the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.780
 weapon loading speed 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.049
 City eggs shot the total recall 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.630
 among other options 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.030
 I think that the game wants to 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.209
 level of gameplay, whether at the level of 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.540
 sound environment graphics in single mode 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.049
 player is really good too. 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.930
 multiplayer mode is also not behind 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:42.100
 the scenarios are wide we have immense 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.410
 functionalities we work in team 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.250
 because we have many weapons and as already 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.190
 and ab 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.070
 we need to evolve as we 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.280
 we've come the longer we play 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.280
 uppermost is our best level 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.270
 use samples and more fills 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.190
 obviously 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.310
 we will also like featured also 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.940
 It is an extra that this game has that is a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.680
 stress that is not living a couch alive 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.770
 it's nothing easy to find 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.610
 but for those who can find it there 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:23.050
 a couch that can drive and walk not 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:25.540
 madness and by the scenario of the air line and I ask 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.940
 everyone who tries to exploit the most of the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.400
 scenarios to try to find in 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.720
 also look on the internet to see some 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.770
 the staff there tried to run over 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.890
 people with couch is total madness 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.350
 button Harboe film promises to please 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.980
 fans of frank teas and that pays attention 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:51.910
 of servers as those who still lose 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:57.180
 the scenario wins until many hours 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.180
 always fun weapon and badges
