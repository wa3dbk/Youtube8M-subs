tree<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.590> be<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.949> I<00:05:13.010> really<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:13.520> one

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
and the leaves are textured and so is

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.570 
and the leaves are textured and so is
the<00:05:17.810> trunk

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.880 

and<00:05:24.120> then<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> also<00:05:24.630> have<00:05:25.320> this<00:05:26.090> flower<00:05:27.090> TV<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:28.860> I

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
and then I also have this flower TV so I

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.390 
and then I also have this flower TV so I
shaded<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.610> petals<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.950> middle<00:05:31.950> shaded

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
shaded the petals in the middle shaded

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.140 
shaded the petals in the middle shaded
yellow<00:05:32.730> and<00:05:33.030> orange<00:05:33.150> too<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:37.550> then<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.970> green

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
yellow and orange too and then the green

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.100 
yellow and orange too and then the green
is<00:05:39.210> leaves<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:42.350> then<00:05:43.350> I<00:05:43.590> also<00:05:43.860> have<00:05:45.110> this

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
is leaves and then I also have this

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.580 
is leaves and then I also have this
sentimental<00:05:47.040> circus<00:05:47.160> Juve<00:05:47.730> and<00:05:48.170> I<00:05:49.170> think<00:05:49.410> this

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
sentimental circus Juve and I think this

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.110 
sentimental circus Juve and I think this
is<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:50.010> only<00:05:50.160> one<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.640> will<00:05:50.700> be<00:05:50.910> making

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
is the only one that I will be making

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.660 
is the only one that I will be making
because<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.050> really<00:05:52.920> don't<00:05:53.010> want<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.250> reproduce

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
because I really don't want to reproduce

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.280 
because I really don't want to reproduce
this<00:05:53.850> again<00:05:54.150> because<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:54.780> took<00:05:55.020> a<00:05:55.050> long<00:05:55.260> time

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
this again because it took a long time

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:02.000 
this again because it took a long time
and<00:05:58.520> then<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.550> have<00:05:59.910> this<00:06:00.150> er<00:06:00.690> HIV<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.890> now

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
and then I have this er HIV and now

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.860 
and then I have this er HIV and now
we'll<00:06:02.160> probably<00:06:02.340> probably<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.390> only<00:06:03.660> making

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
we'll probably probably the only making

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.140 
we'll probably probably the only making
one<00:06:04.020> more<00:06:04.410> of<00:06:04.530> these<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:05.010> that<00:06:05.670> will<00:06:05.820> be<00:06:05.940> for

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
one more of these and that will be for

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.030 
one more of these and that will be for
my<00:06:06.270> shop<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:07.440> probably<00:06:07.680> won't<00:06:07.860> be<00:06:08.010> making

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
my shop and I probably won't be making

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.890 
my shop and I probably won't be making
another<00:06:08.610> one<00:06:08.820> unless<00:06:09.180> someone<00:06:09.450> offers<00:06:09.750> really

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
another one unless someone offers really

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.890 
another one unless someone offers really
well<00:06:10.140> for<00:06:10.260> them<00:06:10.410> because<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.910> one<00:06:12.120> does<00:06:12.390> Nick

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
well for them because this one does Nick

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.810 
well for them because this one does Nick
this<00:06:13.170> one<00:06:13.440> does<00:06:13.620> take<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.890> long<00:06:14.130> time<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:19.820> then

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
this one does take a long time and then

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.860 
this one does take a long time and then
I<00:06:21.270> have<00:06:22.460> this<00:06:23.460> three<00:06:24.450> chippies<00:06:24.900> in<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.200> pod<00:06:25.580> and

I have this three chippies in a pod and

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.989 
I have this three chippies in a pod and
I<00:06:27.870> was<00:06:27.990> going<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.200> make<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.350> necklace<00:06:28.650> out<00:06:28.920> of<00:06:28.980> it
