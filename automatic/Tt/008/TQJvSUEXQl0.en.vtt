00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.220 

so<00:00:05.520> we<00:00:05.960> started<00:00:07.880> with<00:00:08.880> making<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> whip<00:00:09.660> from

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
so we started with making the whip from

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.750 
so we started with making the whip from
here<00:00:11.040> right<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.420> can<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.750> practice<00:00:13.760> with

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
here right so we can just practice with

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.470 
here right so we can just practice with
a<00:00:14.790> mint<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.870> moving<00:00:16.110> from<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.950> elbow<00:00:17.480> start

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
a mint just moving from the elbow start

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.630 
a mint just moving from the elbow start
to<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> whip<00:00:19.050> then<00:00:19.860> we<00:00:20.010> start<00:00:20.250> working

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to make the whip then we start working

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.740 
to make the whip then we start working
from<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.480> shoulder<00:00:22.099> into<00:00:25.400> shoulder

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
from the shoulder into shoulder

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
from the shoulder into shoulder
incorporating<00:00:27.919> whole<00:00:28.919> lot<00:00:29.099> stronger<00:00:29.610> okay<00:00:30.270> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
incorporating whole lot stronger okay so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.720 
incorporating whole lot stronger okay so
shoulder<00:00:31.579> in<00:00:33.350> shoulder<00:00:34.350> rotation<00:00:34.950> from

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
shoulder in shoulder rotation from

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.099 
shoulder in shoulder rotation from
they're<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> switch<00:00:38.480> so<00:00:39.480> once<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.960> go

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
they're going to switch so once we go

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.700 
they're going to switch so once we go
from<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> progression<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.870> elbow<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
from the progression of elbow to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.860 
from the progression of elbow to
shoulder<00:00:47.269> then<00:00:48.269> we<00:00:48.390> start<00:00:48.629> incorporating

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
shoulder then we start incorporating

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.189 
shoulder then we start incorporating
good<00:00:54.739> screwing<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.670> ground

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
good screwing from the ground

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
good screwing from the ground
incorporating<00:00:58.199> hip<00:00:58.440> shoulder<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.429> then<00:01:00.210> at

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
incorporating hip shoulder and then at

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.750 
incorporating hip shoulder and then at
the<00:01:00.449> last<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.989> bringing<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> elbow<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720 

ok<00:01:06.110> from<00:01:07.110> there<00:01:07.460> we're<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> start

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
ok from there we're going to start

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.020 
ok from there we're going to start
taking<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.930> working<00:01:10.880> dropping<00:01:11.880> your

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
taking it in working dropping your

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
doesn't I can screw it down terrif so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.840 
doesn't I can screw it down terrif so
that<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:21.810> show<00:02:22.810> him<00:02:23.740> torque<00:02:24.550> from<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
that so here show him torque from the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:35.360 
that so here show him torque from the
ground<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.660> drop<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.940> screwed

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.250 

and<00:02:36.370> there's<00:02:36.550> just<00:02:36.700> no<00:02:36.910> wet<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.960> smaller

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and there's just no wet just a smaller

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.120 
and there's just no wet just a smaller
version<00:02:38.380> very<00:02:38.980> small<00:02:42.810> okay<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.440> if<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.650> add<00:02:44.680> all

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
version very small okay so if I add all

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.340 
version very small okay so if I add all
those<00:02:45.430> dimensions<00:02:46.120> especially<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> drop

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.030 

changes<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> strike<00:02:53.880> completely<00:02:54.930> potent<00:02:56.040> so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
changes the strike completely potent so

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.740 
changes the strike completely potent so
now<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.459> time<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.910> practice<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.630> can

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
now this time when you practice you can

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.770 
now this time when you practice you can
just<00:02:58.959> start<00:02:59.170> from<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.310> elbow<00:03:00.490> go<00:03:01.390> elbow

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
just start from the elbow go elbow

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.010 
just start from the elbow go elbow
shoulder<00:03:02.910> elbow<00:03:03.910> shoulder<00:03:04.900> hip<00:03:07.020> start

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
shoulder elbow shoulder hip start

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.940 
shoulder elbow shoulder hip start
thinking<00:03:08.290> about<00:03:08.380> screwing<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.670> ground

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
thinking about screwing from the ground

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.940 
thinking about screwing from the ground
incorporating<00:03:11.950> all<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.520> then<00:03:13.300> drop

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.380 

drop<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.530> screw<00:03:20.920> down<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
drop and you can screw down you can

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.390 
drop and you can screw down you can
screw<00:03:22.780> up<00:03:24.209> okay<00:03:25.209> just<00:03:26.080> think<00:03:26.260> about<00:03:26.410> your<00:03:26.680> body

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
screw up okay just think about your body

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.970 
screw up okay just think about your body
wetting<00:03:27.760> your<00:03:27.880> Center<00:03:28.440> collapsing<00:03:29.440> into<00:03:29.770> the
