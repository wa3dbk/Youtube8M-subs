00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 After picking up the quantity, we unload the truck, unpack the boxes according to the varieties, arrange seed garlic in rows according to the order numbers and the parcel identifier. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 After that, qualitative reception follows. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 At the quality reception we control the size of the garlic, we examine the health of the garlic. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 We are careful to see if the rate of damage exceeds 5% or not. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 The damage rate is due to the fact that the damage is not yet classified, but after a 2-month storage the symptoms may occur. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 No whole heads are broken, but only 1-2 heads. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 5% means the weight of the broken wound. If the weight of the broken wounds exceeds 5%, then we ask for compensation from our partners. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 In the past few years, such a thing happened. Upon referral, our partner delivered the quantity that we delivered to our growers within 3 weeks. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 So we're looking for damage. It has two symptoms. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 The calf is soft or characteristic. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 The samples taken so far show that the damage in this year's transport did not exceed 1%. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Every year we control the arrived cargo.
