hi<00:00:00.240> today's<00:00:00.510> October<00:00:00.930> second<00:00:01.399> try<00:00:02.399> to

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi today's October second try to

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.910 
hi today's October second try to
demonstrate<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:03.290> ipad<00:00:04.290> current<00:00:04.650> mounting

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
demonstrate a ipad current mounting

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.639 
demonstrate a ipad current mounting
system<00:00:05.420> here<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.509> have<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.870> currently<00:00:07.200> mounted

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
system here I have it currently mounted

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.980 
system here I have it currently mounted
on<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> dash<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.880> mount<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
on the dash you can mount this on the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.780 
on the dash you can mount this on the
windshield<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:10.620> well<00:00:10.860> it's<00:00:11.190> typically

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
windshield as well it's typically

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.999 
windshield as well it's typically
designed<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.540> windshield<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.860> see

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
designed for windshield but you can see

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.390 
designed for windshield but you can see
that<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.490> disc<00:00:14.880> adapter<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> base

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
that I have a disc adapter in the base

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.060 
that I have a disc adapter in the base
so<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.670> mount<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.180> dash<00:00:18.510> any

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
so you can mount it on the dash any

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.550 
so you can mount it on the dash any
relatively<00:00:20.070> flat<00:00:20.279> surface<00:00:20.699> will<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
relatively flat surface will do this is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.220 
relatively flat surface will do this is
an<00:00:22.710> ipad<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> special<00:00:24.060> case<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.990> works

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
an ipad with a special case that works

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.429 
an ipad with a special case that works
with<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.710> system<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:29.810> will<00:00:30.810> demonstrate<00:00:30.990> how

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
with the system I will demonstrate how

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
with the system I will demonstrate how
this<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.189> attach<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> dis<00:00:33.660> attached<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this will attach and dis attached you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.660 
this will attach and dis attached you
basically<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.630> put<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.550> take<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
basically just put it on and you take it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
basically just put it on and you take it
off<00:00:39.469> put<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> take<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
off put it on and take it off this is a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
off put it on and take it off this is a
magnetic<00:00:44.399> system<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:47.030> I'm<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> parking<00:00:48.660> lot

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
magnetic system and I'm in a parking lot

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.410 
magnetic system and I'm in a parking lot
I<00:00:48.840> wanted<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> demonstrate<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> holding

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I wanted to demonstrate the holding

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.470 
I wanted to demonstrate the holding
force<00:00:52.129> we<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> speed<00:00:54.000> bump<00:00:54.270> on

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
force we have a lot of speed bump on

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
force we have a lot of speed bump on
this<00:00:54.809> parking<00:00:55.170> lot<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:56.430> I'll<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.789> through<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
this parking lot and I'll go through a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.260 
this parking lot and I'll go through a
whole<00:00:57.149> bunch<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.160> doesn't<00:00:59.670> shake<00:00:59.940> go

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
whole bunch of them it doesn't shake go

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.039 
whole bunch of them it doesn't shake go
rattle<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.780> much<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:02.960> there's<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
rattle as much as you think there's a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649 
rattle as much as you think there's a
speed<00:01:04.320> bump<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.339> coming<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.510> another

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
speed bump you know coming up on another

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:17.820 
speed bump you know coming up on another
speed<00:01:07.409> bump<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:10.470> relatively<00:01:11.280> stable

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.470 

leather<00:01:18.820> speed<00:01:19.150> bump<00:01:21.840> big<00:01:22.840> one<00:01:24.120> so<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.180> see

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
leather speed bump big one so you see

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.260 
leather speed bump big one so you see
that<00:01:25.690> for<00:01:26.170> most<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.070> driving<00:01:27.340> conditions

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.860 

this<00:01:31.270> will<00:01:31.510> be<00:01:31.630> just<00:01:31.660> fine<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.250> could<00:01:33.910> break

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
this will be just fine I could break

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.600 
this will be just fine I could break
real<00:01:35.110> hard<00:01:36.840> accelerate<00:01:37.840> real<00:01:38.050> harm<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:39.430> over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
real hard accelerate real harm go over

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.590 
real hard accelerate real harm go over
speed<00:01:39.940> bumps<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:41.520> tends<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.640> have<00:01:42.910> no<00:01:43.180> issues

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
speed bumps this tends to have no issues

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.990 
speed bumps this tends to have no issues
with<00:01:43.750> it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.980 

another<00:01:53.660> speed<00:01:54.050> bump<00:01:54.080> coming<00:01:54.440> up<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:58.990> that's

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
another speed bump coming up here that's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.940 
another speed bump coming up here that's
it<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.250> when<00:02:01.490> you're<00:02:01.640> leaving<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.300> car<00:02:02.950> just

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
it and when you're leaving the car just

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.100 
it and when you're leaving the car just
take<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.460> off<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.880> go<00:02:05.030> when<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.690> get<00:02:05.900> in<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
take it off and go when you get in the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.980 
take it off and go when you get in the
car<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.460> no<00:02:07.729> place<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.000> store<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.630> ipad

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
car you have no place to store the ipad

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.850 
car you have no place to store the ipad
just<00:02:09.440> check<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:11.230> easy<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.850> thanks
