00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.250
 aimed at laser and channel have so for 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.590
 those who do not know what they momo it's 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.270
 soft new card damage up sauce 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.949
 but it's not big deal 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.320
 good so when you could see at 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.790
 rachid taoussi precision me I 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.699
 always under ground so in case 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.960
 that's his machine chain 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.190
 I live do not say if I am 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.570
 demanding not seen that all people to 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.570
 every time they know that I am everything 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.879
 alone but hey that's so it's a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.079
 gameplay fast enough it's not a trick 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.790
 of you 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.339
 finally the score is not bad but by 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.230
 report to note aaa 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.470
 I'm starting to bug in relation to 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.690
 the attention of such a shit compared 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610
 in the anti the intensity of the gameplay know 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.610
 not it's not a big intensity you 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.830
 go see this way here but good 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.179
 after there are games I will find some 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.220
 apologize for myself but here you go 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.990
 for a while I started to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.369
 play pens what the ending is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.369
 a different way of holding his 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.500
 joystick for them here to be able to 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.750
 do the stuff faster 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.320
 done so and so me it starts well 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 fingers but still has to 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.259
 door very well coordinated so you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.399
 see what I mean is there who 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.289
 come back but there are some who do not 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.550
 still at the same time finally here we go 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.920
 I do not care what I say 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.259
 ewolo to explain the closed know 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 fools of you, but you look 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.099
 if it works it does not work too bad for 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.200
 if it works well it can make 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.380
 not bad stuff at all so short so 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.170
 Here in what has like Antar and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.500
 water we want to talk about something that I 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.229
 invented that it's a very good idea 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.690
 I invented the ippon ping 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.270
 so what is the ippon ping so 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.619
 for those who do not know it's for 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.849
 those who do not recognize my channel 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.129
 they can not know what is the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.050
 popping in fact it's the alternative to 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.220
 is nigh ping because we see you 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.750
 we the players who play the pumps 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
 the pompistes as they are called 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.370
 ourselves banon to maxou always for 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.819
 all by the snipers okay so me 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.069
 I had the idea 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.880
 we will create the ping bridges so the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.400
 pumps and its competitions 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.430
 dupont can simply give up competition 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.640
 with blow of pump so on August 2nd blah 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.640
 or two blackops of these roaming 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.470
 tonine of which j 12 and then here we go 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.240
 do like haiping list of course 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.950
 good after that is that the beginning to those who 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.710
 are interested bath or so because 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 I made a forum with all this mess 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.330
 so after that it will be your itno to pathos 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.580
 name that will put it in the description 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.470
 next if he wants to tell me that I could 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.800
 do some advertising for my iphone ping 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.180
 so or so so here it is so 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.490
 that's if it interests the people of st 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.350
 dupont pingwa there because we and for 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.540
 track as I said do not mark are 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.860
 always for the snipers we think 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 never to the guys playing at the bridge because 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.900
 that we still a new 1 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.020
 we our friends watch from happening to be a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.800
 os us these ten meters maximum it's not 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.870
 normal all that 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.170
 so we have claims so 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.720
 this is us and myself with 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.550
 people on Oct 10 fire credits and 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.310
 then here we are going to smash your mouth 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.140
 and then so here is a forum 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.860
 in the description maybe this 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.070
 will depend on hypno as you already said and 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.510
 then here is so benicio forum create your 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.160
 team there are the rules for the moment seen 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.260
 that this is the beginning we will not have in 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.790
 screaming I've done some already 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.200
 a lot of scream with people for 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.610
 see a little dreams if it worked 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.880
 well the members and all that works and 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.740
 well 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.510
 so here is if there are more people 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.430
 so we will not notice anymore 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.690
 learn we can increase our 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.790
 capacity our productivity and we will 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.480
 better okay so do not hesitate to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.200
 come see fast like that and say what 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.090
 what do you think 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.800
 there will also be tournaments of course 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.480
 good after that is the end of the cup 2 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.770
 so that's more to put in 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.570
 place there may be others 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.790
 tournaments but not much to gain 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.190
 to what you are happy does not have 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.170
 sponsor still missed all his little ones 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.540
 organizations but soon it will become 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.370
 a mafia what we are going to smoke 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.600
 blue it means nothing that I 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.790
 but it does not matter because we 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.490
 do not care so here I did nuclear 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.470
 in passing way the gameplay as I 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.000
 say oh no intensity 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.150
 it's not too bad either 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.610
 where his game is doing I'm always at the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.980
 cloud prevention throws 95% of 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.290
 commands from my pen abilities on 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.120
 see the gameplay is over so that's it 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.380
 great thing to say 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.400
 soon these kids we're going to moan for 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.650
 cissÃ© good pump or pump homosexual 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.420

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
 info about the snipers they tell you he 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.070
 there is still nothing on the pop this not 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.360
 normal all to the brim 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.370
 complains that good it's over so 45 a 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.720
 little bit too much and then here I am 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.750
 tell you the next session will see 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.880
 the medals over six years and then that's it 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.340
 what the 39 gastric roll because 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.020
 that I was posture so here I say to 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.840

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.840
