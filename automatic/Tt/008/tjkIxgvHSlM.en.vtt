00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
predict the protect or something but

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.979 
predict the protect or something but
what<00:03:57.200> regardless<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:57.919> get<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.099> speed<00:03:58.310> boost<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
what regardless I get a speed boost and

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.479 
what regardless I get a speed boost and
now<00:03:59.989> it's<00:04:00.200> time<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.410> decent<00:04:00.769> work<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.370> he's

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
now it's time to decent work so he's

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.159 
now it's time to decent work so he's
gonna<00:04:01.579> refer<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.060> Lapras<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.959> I'm<00:04:03.079> gonna

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
gonna refer to Lapras and I'm gonna

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.860 
gonna refer to Lapras and I'm gonna
waterful<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.859> what<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.940> think<00:04:05.180> maybe<00:04:05.419> chef

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
waterful is what I think maybe chef

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.360

farmer<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.470> don't<00:04:06.680> know<00:04:06.769> how<00:04:06.859> possibilities<00:04:07.579> so

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
farmer I don't know how possibilities so

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.240 
farmer I don't know how possibilities so
go<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:10.519> crunch<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.660> get<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.349> defense<00:04:12.799> drop

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
go for crunch and I get the defense drop

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.229 
go for crunch and I get the defense drop
that's<00:04:13.549> huge<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.750> knee<00:04:14.870> courses<00:04:15.319> but<00:04:16.239> well

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
that's huge in the knee courses but well

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.690 
that's huge in the knee courses but well
so<00:04:17.449> he's<00:04:17.570> neutral<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.229> stack<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.099> I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
so he's neutral in that stack and I

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.399 
so he's neutral in that stack and I
think<00:04:19.969> you<00:04:20.060> know<00:04:20.209> for<00:04:20.419> another<00:04:20.510> crunch

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
think you know for another crunch

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:22.740 
think you know for another crunch
because<00:04:21.590> I'm<00:04:21.799> thinking<00:04:22.250> about<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
because I'm thinking about the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.590 
because I'm thinking about the
possibilities<00:04:23.750> what<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.050> do

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
possibilities what I do

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.690 
possibilities what I do
what<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.720> didn't<00:04:24.960> go<00:04:25.050> into<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:26.130> best<00:04:26.400> thing<00:04:26.610> I

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
what I didn't go into the best thing I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.360 
what I didn't go into the best thing I
could<00:04:27.030> go<00:04:27.210> into<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.600> my<00:04:27.690> crest<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.980> probably

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
could go into is my crest and I probably

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.460 
could go into is my crest and I probably
could<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.610> set<00:04:29.910> up<00:04:30.000> all<00:04:30.180> over<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.020> Lapras

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
could have set up all over this Lapras

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.860 
could have set up all over this Lapras
but<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.580> didn't<00:04:32.940> want<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.450> wanted<00:04:33.750> to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
but I just didn't want to I wanted to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.110 
but I just didn't want to I wanted to
just<00:04:34.020> crunch<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.040> kill<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.760> get<00:04:36.000> rid

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
just crunch it and kill it and get rid

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.600 
just crunch it and kill it and get rid
of<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.360> forever<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:38.010> don't<00:04:38.070> like<00:04:38.370> it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
of it forever and I don't like it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.860 
of it forever and I don't like it
and<00:04:40.550> I'm<00:04:41.550> gonna<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:41.970> go<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.420> another<00:04:42.510> corner

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
and I'm gonna just go for another corner

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.980 
and I'm gonna just go for another corner
here<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:44.000> he<00:04:45.000> was<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.270> sure<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.660> think<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.900> know

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
here and he was so sure I think you know

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.830 
here and he was so sure I think you know
plus<00:04:46.170> when<00:04:46.350> I<00:04:46.440> said<00:04:46.620> I'll<00:04:46.740> take<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.070> out<00:04:47.190> by

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
plus when I said I'll take it out by

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.340 
plus when I said I'll take it out by
11:15<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.410> that's<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:50.100> that's<00:04:50.400> that's<00:04:50.880> like

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
11:15 and that's just that's that's like

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.160 
11:15 and that's just that's that's like
balls<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.680> your<00:04:52.830> face<00:04:53.070> eggsy<00:04:53.640> yeah

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
balls to your face eggsy yeah

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.190 
balls to your face eggsy yeah
so<00:04:56.160> that's<00:04:56.970> pretty<00:04:57.120> good<00:04:57.300> now<00:04:57.690> I'm<00:04:57.900> thinking

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
so that's pretty good now I'm thinking

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.540 
so that's pretty good now I'm thinking
maybe<00:04:58.230> he<00:04:58.620> will<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.980> won't<00:04:59.070> have<00:04:59.250> any<00:04:59.430> more

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
maybe he will you won't have any more

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.700 
maybe he will you won't have any more
priority<00:05:00.120> or<00:05:00.390> anything<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:01.050> he<00:05:01.230> goes<00:05:01.470> into

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
priority or anything and he goes into

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.450 
priority or anything and he goes into
miltank<00:05:04.880> house<00:05:06.320> um<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.410> was<00:05:07.980> thinking<00:05:08.010> going

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
miltank house um I was thinking going

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.850 
miltank house um I was thinking going
this<00:05:08.670> picking<00:05:09.030> but<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.330> just<00:05:09.810> didn't<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.530> thought

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
this picking but I just didn't I thought

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.350 
this picking but I just didn't I thought
spiritomb<00:05:11.490> would<00:05:11.700> have<00:05:11.790> been<00:05:11.910> more<00:05:12.180> useful

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
spiritomb would have been more useful

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.210 
spiritomb would have been more useful
than<00:05:12.690> an<00:05:12.810> almost<00:05:13.260> did<00:05:13.530> Sharpedo

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
than an almost did Sharpedo

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.190 
than an almost did Sharpedo
especially<00:05:14.670> with<00:05:14.820> rocks<00:05:15.060> up<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:16.050> makes

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
especially with rocks up so that makes

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.950 
especially with rocks up so that makes
