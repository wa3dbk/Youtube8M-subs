as<00:02:38.530> deep<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:40.750> fan<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.780> thick<00:02:46.209> okay<00:02:47.209> what

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
as deep as that fan is thick okay what

00:02:47.599 --> 00:03:20.360 
as deep as that fan is thick okay what
I'm<00:02:47.719> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.079> do<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:50.000> using<00:02:50.599> mice

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.790 

I<00:03:20.569> don't<00:03:21.569> know<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:21.840> could<00:03:22.020> hear<00:03:22.410> me<00:03:22.470> with

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
I don't know if you could hear me with

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.550 
I don't know if you could hear me with
that<00:03:22.950> router<00:03:23.310> running<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.000> what<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.170> doing

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
that router running but what I was doing

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.150 
that router running but what I was doing
was<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.280> routing<00:03:26.880> out<00:03:27.800> hogging<00:03:28.800> out<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
was just routing out hogging out the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.350 
was just routing out hogging out the
material<00:03:29.790> I've<00:03:30.270> set<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:32.459> depth<00:03:32.849> to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
material I've set the the bit depth to

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.979 
material I've set the the bit depth to
just<00:03:33.800> slightly<00:03:35.450> shallower<00:03:36.450> than<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
just slightly shallower than the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.070 
just slightly shallower than the
thickness<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.340> fan<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.450> fan<00:03:39.780> will

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
thickness of the fan so the fan will

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.680 
thickness of the fan so the fan will
stand<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.890> slightly<00:03:41.819> proud<00:03:42.120> when<00:03:42.540> it's

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
stand just slightly proud when it's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.930 
stand just slightly proud when it's
inlaid<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:43.950> I'm<00:03:44.069> gonna<00:03:44.190> hog<00:03:44.550> out<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
inlaid but I'm gonna hog out the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.280 
inlaid but I'm gonna hog out the
material<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.420> gonna<00:03:45.540> get<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> little<00:03:45.989> closer

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
material I'm gonna get a little closer

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.920 
material I'm gonna get a little closer
to<00:03:46.530> line<00:03:46.739> maybe<00:03:47.069> about<00:03:47.370> 1/32<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.450> an<00:03:48.540> inch<00:03:48.720> away

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
to line maybe about 1/32 of an inch away

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.059 
to line maybe about 1/32 of an inch away
and<00:03:49.680> hug<00:03:50.580> out<00:03:50.790> all<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.590> material<00:03:52.590> where<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
and hug out all this material where the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.620 
and hug out all this material where the
fan<00:03:53.370> will<00:03:53.580> be<00:03:53.700> inlaid<00:03:56.150> okay<00:03:57.150> maybe<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.569> little

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
fan will be inlaid okay maybe a little

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.410 
fan will be inlaid okay maybe a little
difficult<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.500> seed<00:03:58.830> but<00:03:59.160> hog<00:03:59.790> out<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.239> that

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
difficult the seed but hog out all that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.009 
difficult the seed but hog out all that
material<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.470> left<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:03.060> little<00:04:03.660> bit<00:04:03.870> I've

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
material and left just a little bit I've

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.530 
material and left just a little bit I've
gotten<00:04:04.319> close<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.980> line<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:06.360> you'll

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
gotten close to the line that is you'll

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.470 
gotten close to the line that is you'll
notice<00:04:06.780> now<00:04:07.230> I'm<00:04:07.470> using<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.190> small<00:04:08.489> chisel<00:04:08.880> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
notice now I'm using a small chisel and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.140 
notice now I'm using a small chisel and
I'm<00:04:09.930> chiseling<00:04:10.560> perpendicular<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.640> line

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
I'm chiseling perpendicular to that line

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.199 
I'm chiseling perpendicular to that line
and<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:13.319> chisel<00:04:13.620> hit<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.970> use<00:04:18.150> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and the chisel hit that you use a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.300 
and the chisel hit that you use a
smaller<00:04:18.660> chisel<00:04:19.200> that's<00:04:19.410> button<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.190> will

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
smaller chisel that's button that will

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:28.340 
smaller chisel that's button that will
stop<00:04:22.310> sometimes<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:26.840> anyway<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:28.110> going<00:04:28.229> to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
stop sometimes this anyway I'm going to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.670 
stop sometimes this anyway I'm going to
continue<00:04:28.710> chiseling<00:04:29.520> out<00:04:29.960> all<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.380> material

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
continue chiseling out all this material

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.820 
continue chiseling out all this material
okay<00:04:34.710> finish<00:04:35.310> cleaning<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.970> up<00:04:36.590> I'm<00:04:37.590> going

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
okay finish cleaning that up I'm going

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.000 
okay finish cleaning that up I'm going
to<00:04:38.930> test<00:04:39.930> fit<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.200> fan<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.979> it<00:04:41.100> fits<00:04:41.400> nicely

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
to test fit the fan and it fits nicely

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.170 
to test fit the fan and it fits nicely
okay<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.250> don't<00:04:44.340> take<00:04:44.760> some<00:04:45.530> yellow<00:04:46.530> blue<00:04:47.180> I'm

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
okay I don't take some yellow blue I'm

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.260 
okay I don't take some yellow blue I'm
just<00:04:48.630> using<00:04:48.930> just<00:04:50.270> regular<00:04:51.320> Titebond<00:04:53.270> wood

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
just using just regular Titebond wood

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.440 
just using just regular Titebond wood
glue<00:04:56.780> just<00:04:57.780> plenty<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.320> glue<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:58.680> there

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
glue just plenty of glue in there

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:07.390 
glue just plenty of glue in there
especially<00:05:00.450> in<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.660> corners<00:05:04.460> okay

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
especially in the corners okay

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.719 
especially in the corners okay
put<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:08.490> in<00:05:08.639> there<00:05:09.470> piece<00:05:10.470> of<00:05:10.680> wax<00:05:10.950> paper<00:05:11.190> to

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
put it in there piece of wax paper to

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.840 
put it in there piece of wax paper to
keep<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:13.050> glue<00:05:13.380> from<00:05:13.680> sticking<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.430> call

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
keep the glue from sticking to the call

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:24.800 
keep the glue from sticking to the call
and<00:05:16.010> also<00:05:18.080> since<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:23.090> string<00:05:24.090> on<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.510> fan

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
and also since the the string on the fan

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.080 
and also since the the string on the fan
is<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.080> bit<00:05:25.350> thicker<00:05:25.650> than<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:25.979> fan<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:26.880> it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
is a bit thicker than the fan so it

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.659 
is a bit thicker than the fan so it
sticks<00:05:27.570> up<00:05:27.780> a<00:05:27.900> little<00:05:28.020> bit<00:05:28.229> more<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.890> order<00:05:29.580> to

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
sticks up a little bit more in order to

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.580 
sticks up a little bit more in order to
get<00:05:29.849> my<00:05:30.060> clamp<00:05:30.510> on<00:05:30.780> there<00:05:30.900> tightly<00:05:31.349> I'm<00:05:31.440> going

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
get my clamp on there tightly I'm going

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.610 
get my clamp on there tightly I'm going
to<00:05:31.650> put<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.860> piece<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.159> belt<00:05:32.729> over<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.240> way

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
to put a piece of belt over the way

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.040 
to put a piece of belt over the way
paper<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.750> will<00:05:35.960> take<00:05:36.260> up<00:05:37.060> any<00:05:38.060> variation

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
paper that will take up any variation

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.490 
paper that will take up any variation
and<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.410> thickness<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:41.380> components<00:05:42.380> of

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
and the thickness of the components of

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.610 
and the thickness of the components of
the<00:05:42.590> fan<00:05:46.389> and<00:05:47.389> will<00:05:47.570> clamp<00:05:47.900> that<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.320> let<00:05:48.500> it

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
the fan and will clamp that and let it

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.219 
the fan and will clamp that and let it
dry<00:05:49.900> okay

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
dry okay

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.270 
dry okay
I've<00:05:51.710> removed<00:05:52.100> the<00:05:52.520> call<00:05:53.169> glue<00:05:54.169> is<00:05:54.290> pretty<00:05:54.560> dry

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
I've removed the call glue is pretty dry

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:23.090 
I've removed the call glue is pretty dry
now<00:05:55.910> I'm<00:05:56.000> gonna<00:05:56.120> stand<00:05:56.449> it<00:05:56.630> off

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.680 

okay<00:06:24.100> it's<00:06:24.460> pretty<00:06:24.700> much<00:06:24.850> in<00:06:25.120> late<00:06:25.300> takes<00:06:25.630> a

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
okay it's pretty much in late takes a

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.270 
okay it's pretty much in late takes a
little<00:06:25.780> courage<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.440> put<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.800> sander<00:06:27.250> on

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
little courage to put that sander on

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.420 
little courage to put that sander on
there<00:06:27.640> on<00:06:27.760> a<00:06:27.790> little<00:06:28.000> practice<00:06:28.920> but<00:06:29.920> as<00:06:30.280> you

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430
