00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:16.410
 Nine are people and today I am 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:18.350
 you the mmc casemod before what this mod 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.410
 Adding roughly is not much 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.750
 except our beautiful cape of msi casemod 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.880
 Add a series of cape to the man 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 can also design and then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.449
 can easily upload 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 let's play games has its own cape 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 We also have a lot of other youtubers 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.160
 probably also have their own 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.399
 capes the mod is still relative at the moment 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.590
 unpopular 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 but you can see what is happening there 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 So we can look around it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.629
 will still cage so we have to go now 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 Just go down the stairs 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.340
 continue down so who has here already 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.920
 capes just now no one knows 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 but there is one whether the francs 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the subject whether the fine capes whether the fine 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.439
 Unfortunately, capes can be used as well 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 that means it is not that way anymore 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.430
 now that only the people optive 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.770
 also bought the many 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 capes have but now can easy 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.470
 all the people who have the casemod too 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 whether the fine cancers have become the capes 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.799
 but only seen by the people, too 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.939
 msi capes have installed and not 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.360
 of which no music apps 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.360
 Installed 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.979
 that adds and actually already added 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.299
 installation package until then and there 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 we are already at the installation partner 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.950
 Of course, you have to get it for yourself 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.299
 download first 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.759

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.700
 so open your music apps folder pulls 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.920
 delete the media partner before and already 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.739

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.989
