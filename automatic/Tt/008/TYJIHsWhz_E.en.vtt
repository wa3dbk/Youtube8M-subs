 if you do not say we'll go there 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.290
 simple one takes the ball mosson does this 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.220

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.720

 the other is always there good it is expected 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 move on to something else I know since 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.330
 that we put that my card is everything 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.280
 miss it look this is extremely 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.790

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.439

 you know the same gestures as me it's 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.020
 to say that you will close the envelope 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.720

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.470
 hot it's hot it's hot but 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.740
 one of the best guards a few 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.740
 seconds shops 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.580
 you work at the post office it's not 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.840
 possible 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.349
 or you have a big language but 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.520
 it was unlikely it is extremely rare 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:17.620
 very rare once you need a club 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.620
 have to stop these good ones on an amazing 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.090
 one 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.260
 what did you open it just now 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:35.610
 it's quite difficult like that 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.610
 what do you like rice pudding 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.419

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.970
 I will say what I can give you that 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.080
 no longer play but we will do otherwise 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.940
 but we will do otherwise than when 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.169
 as I still have an envelope of 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.370
 help because we just never know 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.570
 here I made a prediction before 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.440
 obviously in this envelope ladies 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.479
 and gentlemen look rightly 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.460

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.460
 ticket he's right there and he's signed 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:06.400

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.550
