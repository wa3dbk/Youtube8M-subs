in<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.630> last<00:00:24.869> match<00:00:26.330> looks<00:00:27.330> best<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.840> did<00:00:28.050> one

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
in that last match looks best I did one

mistake trying to do it to hit this arm
throw<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.940> I<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:33.930> cheaper<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
throw and I think was cheaper for this

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.190 
throw and I think was cheaper for this
Championships<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.780> well<00:00:37.020> bit

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
Championships was not very well bit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
Championships was not very well bit
there<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.700> one<00:00:38.700> point<00:00:39.000> like<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
there and one point like that it's it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.450 
there and one point like that it's it
could<00:00:40.530> decide<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> whole

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
could decide the whole

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.389 
could decide the whole
reflect<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> whole<00:00:43.660> match<00:00:43.899> I<00:00:44.399> had

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
reflect the whole match I had

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.420 
reflect the whole match I had
opportunity<00:00:46.000> what<00:00:46.180> comes<00:00:46.420> out<00:00:46.570> first<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:47.430> think

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
opportunity what comes out first I think

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.790 
opportunity what comes out first I think
this<00:00:48.520> is<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.760> number<00:00:49.420> one<00:00:49.750> but<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.340> I<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:53.500> I

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
this is a number one but it I can I

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.369 
this is a number one but it I can I
can't<00:00:54.760> judge<00:00:55.000> him<00:00:55.120> for<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.750> was<00:00:55.930> not<00:00:56.079> a

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
can't judge him for that it was not a

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.880 
can't judge him for that it was not a
clear<00:00:56.710> point<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.930> like<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.170> slip<00:00:59.500> didn't<00:00:59.800> it

his horn if you were to wrestle like
that<00:01:22.660> with<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:22.929> guy<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:24.490> doubts<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.000> would

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
have you want to get to it that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.779 
have you want to get to it that
situation<00:01:28.950> he<00:01:29.950> would<00:01:30.100> have<00:01:30.220> scored<00:01:30.520> his<00:01:30.640> own

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
situation he would have scored his own

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.029 
situation he would have scored his own
voice<00:01:31.060> but<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.020> think<00:01:32.259> he<00:01:32.380> was<00:01:32.500> capable<00:01:32.710> of

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
voice but I think he was capable of

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.070 
voice but I think he was capable of
doing<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.520> he<00:01:33.940> should<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.270> be<00:01:34.390> more<00:01:34.539> brave<00:01:34.780> to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
doing that he should it be more brave to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.190 
doing that he should it be more brave to
try<00:01:35.259> this<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.940> looked<00:01:37.119> like<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.360> Turkish<00:01:37.869> it

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
try this it looked like the Turkish it

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.870 
try this it looked like the Turkish it
I'm<00:01:38.679> getting<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.039> advantage<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.700> ham

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
I'm getting the advantage of the ham

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.090 
I'm getting the advantage of the ham
fighting<00:01:40.330> early<00:01:40.630> had<00:01:41.170> Spencer<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.770> his<00:01:41.890> heels

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
fighting early had Spencer on his heels

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610 
fighting early had Spencer on his heels
a<00:01:42.250> little<00:01:42.340> bit<00:01:42.780> yes<00:01:43.780> he<00:01:44.380> did<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.830> think

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
a little bit yes he did I think

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.440 
a little bit yes he did I think
again<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:47.210> think<00:01:48.110> Spencer<00:01:48.590> put<00:01:48.800> a<00:01:49.450> could

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
again I I think Spencer put a could

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.810 
again I I think Spencer put a could
handle<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:50.960> match<00:01:51.200> more<00:01:52.040> aggressive<00:01:52.640> and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
handle this match more aggressive and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.760 
handle this match more aggressive and
you<00:01:53.090> want<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> let<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.900> tour

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
you want to let the tour

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.990 
you want to let the tour
in<00:01:55.130> flight

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
in flight

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.950 
in flight
that's<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.740> main<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.730> main<00:01:59.960> problem

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that's I think the main the main problem

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.170 
that's I think the main the main problem
in<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.230> match<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.830> wanted<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.370> see<00:02:02.580> him<00:02:02.700> more

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
in this match I wanted to see him more

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.450 
in this match I wanted to see him more
brave<00:02:03.510> more<00:02:04.110> aggressive<00:02:04.650> until<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.160> forces

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
brave more aggressive until it forces

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.790 
brave more aggressive until it forces
the<00:02:05.820> guy<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> plan<00:02:06.750> he<00:02:07.020> tried<00:02:07.470> but

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
the guy that was the plan he tried but

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.980 
the guy that was the plan he tried but
obviously<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.060> saw<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.420> end<00:02:09.690> he's

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
obviously what we saw in the end he's

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.440 
obviously what we saw in the end he's
capable<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.530> scoring<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.160> us<00:02:11.700> 10<00:02:11.940> seconds

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
capable of scoring for us 10 seconds

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.320

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
obviously he reserved some and maybe

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.870 
obviously he reserved some and maybe
unconsciously<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.440> he<00:02:16.590> reserved<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.280> he

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
unconsciously but he reserved to be he
