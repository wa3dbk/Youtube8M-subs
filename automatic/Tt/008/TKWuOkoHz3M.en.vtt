 kilometers I can not taste anymore 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.250
 the motorbike and the paisas that you come to 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.920
 Mazatlan do you like the week the bike 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450

 exactly follow then to see if it leaves us 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.150
 the lady first goes 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.770
 signal good friends online 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 we continue what the week is and the 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.760
 motorcycle and let's try who is the best 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.760
 runner and who is cheering you motorcycle spinning 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.010
 I had 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.470
 the problem is not that I take it 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.700
 problem is that I returned it 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.700
 maybe not regression 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.380
 so that the ecology that does not 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.190
 then according to the expenses I care about the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.190
 senior companies 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.700
 when the little horses that missed something 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.349
 What happens is that more space is needed because 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.180
 you have to catch some speed at 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.220
 beginning and listening to lift the bike 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.860
 and one arrives very fast 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.290
 in what space do you need to be able to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.270
 lift are of lost about 50-60 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.820
 meters to give strength to the bike 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.260
 and then the pull and that the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.920
 problem is that here we do not have much 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.800
 space 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.990
