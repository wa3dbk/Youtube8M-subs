00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.740
 hey people what's up i think it's awesome 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.170
 Snake and I have really hard times 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.080
 he could read derek 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.380
 partly so i'll try that way 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.750
 many as it expects to definitely 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.180
 edit some unfortunately can be 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.619
 do not realize 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.270
 But then I will be on top of that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.120
 so that's not even the case 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.999
 just so that costs a lot of time and you 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.859
 really needs a lot of rewriting and it is 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.620
 sometimes quite complicated I know 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.569
 Maybe that does not interest you 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.399
 yes how I do that I can do that too 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.800
 Mine tutorial how to do that 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.559
 if you have such a great place de 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.179
 tailor or that I have you 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.909
 Just show it even if you like that 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.280
 may not be interested 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.620
 that's how that's possible 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.389
 any case, otherwise a combo or something 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.370
 then I know that I'll do that 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.049
 definitely should i have now 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.759
 represents a mission I have up here 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.600
 every case again a few space doc 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.000
 sat down 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.430
 then I have a few in here 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.840
 chicago bot is put on everyone 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.369
 very funny and something different and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 the rest I have him a few more 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 Airships then I have an airbus 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.850
 747 on the waiting position and one 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.979
 green cargo plain and at the end of the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840
 runway a blue cargo plans 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.539
 I did that extra way I had 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.469
 here before 45 pieces are and we 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.350
 have the then with several people 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.149
 tested and the runway for it easy 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.920
 too short and you can not do it anymore 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.369
 reasonable take off then must be real 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.320
 be careful otherwise you explode the one 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.329
 bit tricky the shit is i can 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.719
 do not sit down at the airport because 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.749
 he since the patch 1.18 it is from the editor 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.990
 locked these areas just like in the 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.329
 team deathmatch in buildings 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.530
 last time or such a shit times 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.649
 Maybe I can do it somehow 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.060
 I'll work around that though 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.590
 test it in detail and he has me now 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.940
 even a few others put the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.690
 Of course we have to go through it again 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.360
 test 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 Of course, all missions can be done here 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.910
 which I then published on mine 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.860
 on the link where you find this mission 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.150
 I can get rid of the link, of course 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.209
 again in the description is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:33.190
 of course on ps3 and ps4 again 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.290
 playable and yes there is more 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.530
 I do not believe in wm yes, exactly me 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.430
 have still tested with the train and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.730
 the electric shock, and anyway such 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.880
 special weapons and such a shit and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 I 'm beginning to suspect that 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.060
 rockstar patched that is 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.280
 this mission that you regulate 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.450
 could get and then you have the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.299
 free mode and it has become like that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.700
 that if they are the opponents 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.650
 shoots the weapons eg emission 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.150
 creates persistent electroshock like that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120
 and then I have all flattened the opponents 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.370
 made and also with fireworks rockets 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 because I did not have it myself 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.850
 and did not want to have unconditional and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.190
 the opponents drop it though 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.170
 the lies then on the ground almost like one 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.700
 dead object so you can do little 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.859
 pick up and that's why I believe that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.500
 I'll fix this time 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.630
 of course, there again inform 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.120
 and of course try again 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.170
 to go 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.480
 I have a few more now 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.760
 more options because I 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.760
 now a developer of playstation 3 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.799
 t shirts usually has 10,000 euro 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.209
 Graz follows as I read that 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.560
 but no matter you have now and yes I will 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.459
 In any case, so many are trying 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.709
 wishes from you to fulfill and the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.530
 Of course, the mission comes gradually 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.760
 when I have time, unless 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.870
 which can create 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.730
 then I would say thank you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.110
 Of course, as always for watching hope 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.700
 Of course you liked it 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.400
 If that's the case , I would not be like that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.870
 you thumb up girlfriend is called and 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.980
 Of course we'll see each other 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.980
 next video people to no animal 1
