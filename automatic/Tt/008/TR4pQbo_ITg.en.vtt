00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the cage there's one here and then one

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.810 
the cage there's one here and then one
down<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.070> also<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.609> like

the<00:00:27.000> bar<00:00:27.180> spacing<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.529> pretty<00:00:28.800> thin<00:00:29.210> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the bar spacing it is pretty thin so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
the bar spacing it is pretty thin so
you're<00:00:30.330> gonna<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> baby<00:00:30.750> rats<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> you

you're gonna have baby rats in here you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.500 
you're gonna have baby rats in here you
don't<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.579> worry<00:00:32.700> about<00:00:32.790> them<00:00:33.059> escaping

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
don't have to worry about them escaping

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.400 
don't have to worry about them escaping
it<00:00:33.750> either

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it either

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.280 
it either
and<00:00:34.940> then<00:00:35.940> another<00:00:36.120> pearl<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> cage<00:00:36.899> which

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and then another pearl of the cage which

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
and then another pearl of the cage which
can<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> pro<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.920> con<00:00:37.950> depending<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:39.360> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
can be a pro or con depending on if you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.830 
can be a pro or con depending on if you
like<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> cage<00:00:41.879> itself<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.570> all

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
like that but the cage itself is all

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.740 
like that but the cage itself is all
wire<00:00:43.079> mesh<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.030> shelves<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
wire mesh so it's shelves and the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.049 
wire mesh so it's shelves and the
stairways<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.320> wire<00:00:46.500> mesh<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
stairways are wire mesh but I like that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.040 
stairways are wire mesh but I like that
because<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> worry

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because then you don't have to worry

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.279 
because then you don't have to worry
about<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.320> rat<00:00:49.500> ever<00:00:50.039> chewing<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> them<00:00:51.289> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
about your rat ever chewing on them and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
about your rat ever chewing on them and
you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.890> decorate<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.430> cage<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.000> towels<00:00:54.329> or

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you can decorate the cage with towels or

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410 
you can decorate the cage with towels or
fleas<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> make<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.379> cozy<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.219> use<00:00:57.030> towels

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
fleas to make it more cozy I use towels

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
fleas to make it more cozy I use towels
because<00:00:57.660> Miko<00:00:58.020> isn't<00:00:58.289> much<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.590> chiller<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
because Miko isn't much of a chiller so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.770 
because Miko isn't much of a chiller so
I<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.789> have<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> worry<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.570> with

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I don't have to worry about that with

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
I don't have to worry about that with
him<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.100> towels<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.700> one

on each side up there and then down here

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.149 
on each side up there and then down here
on<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.970> level<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.979> two

on this level I just have one or two
washcloths<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.780> two

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
in the cage they fit very nice in the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
in the cage they fit very nice in the
cage<00:01:26.700> there's<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:28.020> minimum<00:01:28.350> folding<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
cage there's very minimum folding that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
cage there's very minimum folding that
you<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.200> cage

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you have to do and then it's the cage

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
you have to do and then it's the cage
itself<00:01:33.110> Nico<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.350> doing<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.960> cage

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
itself Nico are you doing the cage

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
itself Nico are you doing the cage
itself<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.890> completely<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.610> proof<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.150> down

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
itself is completely to proof so down

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780 
itself is completely to proof so down
here<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> proof<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.310> super<00:01:41.460> nice

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
here is to proof so that is super nice

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
here is to proof so that is super nice
and<00:01:42.740> then<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.500> liked<00:01:46.680> how<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and then I also really liked how the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
and then I also really liked how the
cage<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:47.640> handles<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> little

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
cage has handles because it is a little

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
cage has handles because it is a little
bit<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> heavier<00:01:49.439> cage<00:01:51.860> that's<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
bit more of a heavier cage that's I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.380 
bit more of a heavier cage that's I
guess<00:01:53.100> that's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.490> con<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> cage<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
guess that's a con of the cage it is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
guess that's a con of the cage it is
pretty<00:01:54.570> heavy<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> need<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> move<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
pretty heavy but if you need to move the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
pretty heavy but if you need to move the
cage<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.780> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> drag<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
cage I just kind of drag it on the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.620 
cage I just kind of drag it on the
carpet<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.700> slides<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.719> nice

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
carpet because this slides really nice

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.840 
carpet because this slides really nice
so<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:01.810> don't<00:02:02.080> really<00:02:02.260> see<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.250> as<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.549> setback

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
so I don't really see that as a setback

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.280 
so I don't really see that as a setback
but<00:02:04.150> there<00:02:04.299> are<00:02:04.390> two<00:02:04.540> handles<00:02:04.930> there's<00:02:05.110> one

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
but there are two handles there's one

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.109 
but there are two handles there's one
here<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:06.250> then<00:02:06.430> one<00:02:06.610> here<00:02:06.640> if<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.970> want<00:02:07.090> to

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
here and then one here if you want to

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.210 
here and then one here if you want to
looks<00:02:07.299> up<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.570> cage<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:08.860> which<00:02:09.039> i<00:02:09.160> think

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
looks up the cage and then which i think

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.400 
looks up the cage and then which i think
is<00:02:09.459> really<00:02:09.670> nice<00:02:09.759> for<00:02:09.819> down<00:02:10.179> here<00:02:10.539> there's<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
is really nice for down here there's a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.350 
is really nice for down here there's a
handle<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:11.860> each<00:02:11.920> side<00:02:12.310> too<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:12.819> when<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> want

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
handle on each side too so when you want

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
handle on each side too so when you want
to<00:02:13.420> take<00:02:13.600> off<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.080> bottom<00:02:14.200> part<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.819> use

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
to take off the bottom part you can use

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.729 
to take off the bottom part you can use
the<00:02:16.090> handle<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.390> kind<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.720> help<00:02:16.840> help<00:02:17.290> lift<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
the handle to kind of help help lift it

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.750 
the handle to kind of help help lift it
up<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.739> another<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:21.069> guess<00:02:21.310> kind<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
up and then another I guess kind of the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.900 
up and then another I guess kind of the
cage<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> doors<00:02:22.780> are<00:02:23.170> pretty<00:02:23.470> small

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
cage is that the doors are pretty small

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.340 
cage is that the doors are pretty small
so<00:02:24.910> if<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.180> have<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.330> litter<00:02:25.540> box<00:02:25.780> or<00:02:26.170> wheel

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
so if you have a litter box or wheel

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.720 
so if you have a litter box or wheel
they're<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:26.739> gonna<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:26.980> able<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.190> fit<00:02:27.520> through

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
they're not gonna be able to fit through

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.110 
they're not gonna be able to fit through
the<00:02:27.790> door<00:02:28.000> unfortunately<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.800> what<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the door unfortunately but what I do to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.080 
the door unfortunately but what I do to
get<00:02:31.239> around<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.860> use<00:02:33.069> Kleenexes<00:02:33.730> for

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
get around that is I use Kleenexes for

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030 
get around that is I use Kleenexes for
his<00:02:34.209> litter<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.780> then<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.560> change<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.950> every

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
his litter and then to change it every

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.970 
his litter and then to change it every
day<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.340> kind<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:38.470> roll<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.800> up<00:02:38.920> like

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
day I just kind of gonna roll it up like

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.530 
day I just kind of gonna roll it up like
that<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> too<00:02:42.790> bad<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> problem

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
that so it's see it too bad as a problem

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.420 
that so it's see it too bad as a problem
if<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.810> clean<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> cage<00:02:44.380> twice<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> week<00:02:45.040> then<00:02:45.370> I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
if I clean the cage twice a week then I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.210 
if I clean the cage twice a week then I
wash<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.480> litter<00:02:46.660> pan<00:02:46.870> once<00:02:47.230> or<00:02:47.830> twice<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.069> week

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
wash a litter pan once or twice a week

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.210 
wash a litter pan once or twice a week
so<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.489> don't<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.819> worry<00:02:48.970> about<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
so I don't have to worry about that and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.350 
so I don't have to worry about that and
then<00:02:51.870> um<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.430> also<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.880> how<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.090> cage

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
then um I also really like how the cage

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.600 
then um I also really like how the cage
you<00:02:55.720> can<00:02:55.870> adjust<00:02:56.319> these<00:02:56.470> bars<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:57.160> however<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
you can adjust these bars to however you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.470 
you can adjust these bars to however you
want<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.110> want<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.650> have<00:03:00.450> both<00:03:01.450> of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
want so if you want you can have both of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.180 
want so if you want you can have both of
the<00:03:01.690> shelves<00:03:02.019> up<00:03:02.170> here<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.739> lower<00:03:02.950> this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the shelves up here you can lower this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.009 
the shelves up here you can lower this
one<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.700> want<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.150> mean<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.660> can<00:03:04.810> really

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
one if you want I mean you can really

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.180 
one if you want I mean you can really
change<00:03:05.170> up<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.560> cage<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.980> think

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
change up in this cage and I think

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.190 
change up in this cage and I think
that's<00:03:06.340> really<00:03:07.030> nice<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.299> keep<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.019> cage

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that's really nice to keep the cage

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.509 
that's really nice to keep the cage
interesting<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:08.920> your<00:03:09.010> rats<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:11.519> also

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
interesting for your rats and I also

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.539 
interesting for your rats and I also
like<00:03:12.940> how<00:03:16.019> big<00:03:17.019> its<00:03:17.440> cage<00:03:17.739> itself<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.250> all<00:03:18.400> very

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
like how big its cage itself is all very

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.610 
like how big its cage itself is all very
much<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.180> said<00:03:19.420> but<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.049> stairways<00:03:20.410> are

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
much like I said but the stairways are

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.890 
much like I said but the stairways are
too<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.070> do<00:03:21.130> kind<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.820> that's<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
too so I do kind of like that that's you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.890 
too so I do kind of like that that's you
can<00:03:23.049> wash<00:03:23.260> everything<00:03:23.620> super<00:03:24.010> easy

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
can wash everything super easy

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.150 
can wash everything super easy
but<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:25.930> also<00:03:26.200> like<00:03:26.579> if<00:03:27.579> you're<00:03:29.160> struggling

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
but I also like if you're struggling

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.180 
but I also like if you're struggling
with<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.700> find<00:03:30.910> something<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.420> put<00:03:31.540> over<00:03:31.750> that

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
with to find something to put over that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.650 
with to find something to put over that
I'm<00:03:33.190> rather<00:03:33.459> than<00:03:33.670> making<00:03:33.850> something<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.420> found

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
I'm rather than making something I found

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.099 
I'm rather than making something I found
that<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.950> socks<00:03:36.250> work<00:03:36.670> great<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.930> don't

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
that just socks work great and you don't

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.569 
that just socks work great and you don't
use<00:03:38.290> any<00:03:38.470> clips<00:03:38.709> or<00:03:38.859> anything<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.280> keep<00:03:39.430> them

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
use any clips or anything to keep them

along I can show you guys that sometimes
I<00:03:51.459> do<00:03:51.519> find<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.120> ladders<00:03:52.450> don't<00:03:52.900> always<00:03:53.140> go<00:03:53.590> in

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
I do find the ladders don't always go in

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.270 
I do find the ladders don't always go in
they're<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.130> nicest

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.880 

but<00:03:57.970> once<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.750> find<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.260> all<00:03:59.440> three<00:03:59.740> of<00:03:59.800> them

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
but once I find that all three of them

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.140 
but once I find that all three of them
fit<00:04:00.100> differently<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:00.730> if<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.910> find<00:04:01.090> that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
fit differently so if you find that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.420 
fit differently so if you find that
three<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.569> make<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> best<00:04:02.050> match<00:04:02.470> just

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
three that make the best match just

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.830 
three that make the best match just
remember<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.850> order<00:04:04.209> because<00:04:04.360> then<00:04:04.480> they

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
remember that order because then they

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.230 
remember that order because then they
fit<00:04:05.080> in<00:04:05.200> perfect<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.830> way<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:10.060> cage

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
fit in perfect that way see the cage

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.320 
fit in perfect that way see the cage
itself<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.900> pretty<00:04:11.200> tall<00:04:11.380> cage<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.910> really

like that
um<00:04:15.069> because<00:04:15.250> rats<00:04:15.550> like<00:04:15.819> to<00:04:15.970> climb<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:17.079> then

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709
