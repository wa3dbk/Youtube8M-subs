00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
 SID 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.389
 they were not even from the corporate side 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.380
 and with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.919
 Now I want the same 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.839
 October on the back 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.899
 Lichen refer 100 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.189
 but the denial betrays 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.210
 Sensual with those of women, I just agree 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 still rock time occupied 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.390
 and the individual motifs has a happy-end and reprinted 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.220
 one and a half the red background from the state, I've retouched so well it 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.310
 went 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.310
 then not deposited immediately 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.030
 then printed 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 Sauter now dashing up 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 the customers have a Lehmann 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520
 Tehran 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 Need exists bets 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.750
 on 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.790
 a guest 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.060
 important is now judged differently 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 because the Ukraine pumps gate 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 remained unhurt 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.110
 DZ 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.510
 Be satisfied 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 arrived here directly from my own half 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 Contact never stopped 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.300
 Zurich 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 wanted to come in addition to detailed from behind 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.700
 Reach Sterchi 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
 out again below 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.460
 this succeeded 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.209
 and talks about projects 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.639
 mixed palette 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.099
 namely with the downhill upwards than on the right side 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.149
 August 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.249
 for Klich 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.589
 so good is that the back 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.589
 that's the front 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 that does not sound so easy to support 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.439
 and 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.839
 right here at the thread of Dr 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.849
 no treats before 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 now that I am where a house of cards came 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.409
 I get higher with the NADA 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.899
 XIV 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.459
 we have further 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.269
 and carry my projects 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.369
 the next toilet namely for the chaining on that is the back 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:05.379
 that's the front 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.900
 Stecher an approximate percent this distance as between effort he parried 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.529
 and where that parried the 11th 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 again and at the same distance back out again 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.299
 trained and Greens 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.389
 Kathleen 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.829
 next project in the non-compliant 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.859
 exactly where clock rates re-emerge the projects with files 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.829
 Cheat house became my partner 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.419
 and if we continue like that 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.209
 the door is totally complicated but you can lure the camera to Frankfurt 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.149
 on the emergence but always times something is difficult 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.929
 ImpflÃ¼cken goes
