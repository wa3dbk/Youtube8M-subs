see<00:00:16.470> how<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.770> hardware<00:00:17.130> stacks<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.119> what

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
see how the hardware stacks up and what

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
see how the hardware stacks up and what

scores are actually generated and to be

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
scores are actually generated and to be
honest<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:20.730> expecting<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.330> ma<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> win<00:00:22.109> all

of<00:00:22.740> these<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.640> by<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:24.240> much

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
of these we just want to see by how much

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.210 
of these we just want to see by how much
though<00:00:24.779> both<00:00:25.050> devices<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> 5-inch<00:00:26.099> screen

801<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.579> before<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.000> started<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.570> want<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
801 just before get started just want to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
801 just before get started just want to
point<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.140> both<00:00:40.379> devices<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.309> been

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
point out both devices have just been

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
point out both devices have just been
turned<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.690> power<00:00:43.020> saving

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
turned on and there's no power saving

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.750 
turned on and there's no power saving
modes<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.010> whatsoever

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
modes on whatsoever

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
modes on whatsoever
so<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:45.629> benchmark<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> we're<00:00:46.379> going

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
so the first benchmark that we're going

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.869 
so the first benchmark that we're going
to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.620> doing<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.370> quadrant

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to be doing here is going to be quadrant

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.700 
to be doing here is going to be quadrant
so<00:00:48.329> we'll<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> full<00:00:48.809> benchmark<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so we'll do a full benchmark so here we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
so we'll do a full benchmark so here we
go<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.280> two<00:00:50.420> one<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:53.660> quadrants<00:00:54.660> finished

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
go three two one go quadrants finished

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.950 
go three two one go quadrants finished
so<00:00:55.379> we'll<00:00:55.530> say<00:00:55.710> yes<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> proceed<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.510> m8

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so we'll say yes to proceed and the m8

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
so we'll say yes to proceed and the m8
scores<00:00:58.910> 22,000<00:01:00.260> 556<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.770> comparison<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> there

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
scores 22,000 556 in comparison to there

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
scores 22,000 556 in comparison to there
s<00:01:02.789> force<00:01:03.180> twelve<00:01:03.780> thousand<00:01:04.290> nine<00:01:04.530> hundred

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
s force twelve thousand nine hundred

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.520 
s force twelve thousand nine hundred
twenty<00:01:05.400> seven<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.420> absolutely<00:01:07.020> killing<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
twenty seven so absolutely killing it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:18.020 
twenty seven so absolutely killing it
there<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:08.340> make<00:01:08.490> sure<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.790> time

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there just make sure to to this time

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
there just make sure to to this time
just<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.320> test<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.799> both<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
just going to test them both here and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.130 
just going to test them both here and
we'll<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.090> three<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.960> go

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 

and<00:01:25.560> tutus<00:01:26.100> finished<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.730> as<00:01:26.850> well<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and tutus finished here as well and you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.020 
and tutus finished here as well and you
can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> m8<00:01:27.870> scoring<00:01:28.260> 34<00:01:29.010> thousand<00:01:29.790> one

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
can see the m8 scoring 34 thousand one

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.970 
can see the m8 scoring 34 thousand one
hundred<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> eighty<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.930> comparison<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.890> the

S force twenty eight thousand three

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.430 
S force twenty eight thousand three
hundred<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.100> fourteen<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.910> again<00:01:36.690> absolutely

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
hundred and fourteen so again absolutely

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.820 
hundred and fourteen so again absolutely
killing<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.520> m8<00:01:42.470> that<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.680> be

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
killing it there m8 that we're gonna be

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.380 
killing it there m8 that we're gonna be
running<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.580> Geekbench<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
running here is gonna be Geekbench so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
running here is gonna be Geekbench so
we'll<00:01:45.510> get<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.660> loaded<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.229> well<00:01:46.410> gives

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
we'll get that loaded up as well gives

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
we'll get that loaded up as well gives
you<00:01:47.010> some<00:01:47.190> OPS's<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> specs<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.360> got

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you some OPS's of the specs so you got

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.320 
you some OPS's of the specs so you got
