00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
to say odd people live in the East now

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.380 
to say odd people live in the East now
as<00:01:09.009> someone<00:01:09.250> who<00:01:09.430> lives<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.820> East<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:10.180> take

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
feet well that's nothing major in fact

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.409 
feet well that's nothing major in fact
remembering<00:01:50.859> that<00:01:50.979> odd<00:01:51.219> people<00:01:51.520> live<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.119> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
east I'm heading generally east so I

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.289 
east I'm heading generally east so I
could<00:01:55.270> fly<00:01:55.509> at<00:01:56.279> 3,500<00:01:57.279> feet<00:01:57.310> now<00:01:57.969> that<00:01:58.119> makes

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
could fly at 3,500 feet now that makes

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:58.739 
could fly at 3,500 feet now that makes
sense

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
sense

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.809

any restricted airspace I would go down

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.620

active up - and base my decision on that
I'll<00:04:02.990> make<00:04:03.380> some<00:04:03.590> calls<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:04.070> figure<00:04:04.310> out

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
I'll make some calls to figure out

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.890 
I'll make some calls to figure out
whether<00:04:04.640> that's<00:04:04.820> gonna<00:04:05.030> be<00:04:05.180> hot<00:04:05.420> or<00:04:05.660> cold

whether that's gonna be hot or cold

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.680 
whether that's gonna be hot or cold
today<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.620> lastly<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:08.150> because<00:04:08.540> we

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
today and lastly because because we

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.060 
today and lastly because because we
check<00:04:08.900> our<00:04:09.050> knodel's<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.590> each<00:04:09.740> and<00:04:09.890> every

fly over them and not worry about it you

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.230 
fly over them and not worry about it you
may<00:04:20.959> find<00:04:21.260> a<00:04:21.410> TFR<00:04:21.980> that<00:04:22.220> you<00:04:22.520> know<00:04:22.640> extends<00:04:23.120> up

may find a TFR that you know extends up

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240 
may find a TFR that you know extends up
