00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello people more the youngest i am me 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.030
 again for the session beginning or 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 this week and me will start in one week 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 I'm looking forward to it today I'll show you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 how to do something with small tricks 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.769
 can learn faster and I think for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.599
 some it is nothing new now but 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.880
 for others or in asses 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.380
 certainly changes one or the other already 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.989
 let's start with the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.229
 attitudes at hard as hard 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.269
 gives 75 xp and that's worth it 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.619
 if you need a little longer 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.120
 but should be careful that you do not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.740
 otherwise often it dies 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.270
 better if you go back instead of the 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 You can start adventure mode from the moment you arrive 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.380
 unlock 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.480
 as soon as you have shown yourself in the on 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 campaign as soon as you have 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.290
 are logged with level 1 launched 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 directly to your city and runs like this 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.790
 the insulation panels and claudia of his weapon 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.430
 for mornings, of course, whichever 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.130
 Of course, you should play great 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.990
 a bow for example then need of course 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.950
 from the hunter in my case, I use the 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.600
 Formalities and just those of temples which 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.530
 of which in the men comes plays 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.329
 not matter 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 that was removed with the last patch 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.159
 Now I will show you what the fastest way 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.289
 and after that that's four times 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 I've ever tested one 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.979
 three quarters of an hour, I am none 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.929
 come to a happy conclusion because it was 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 always happiness dependent I assumed 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.369
 that is the fastest airing but that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.079
 was not because I was unlucky or 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.759
 better if you are unlucky then 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.159
 they are suddenly more difficult 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.630
 the fina beham and takes too long as 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 as if I build now is or halls 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.039
 Diakonie macher therefore is mine 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.069
 opinion has been the fastest 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.380
 to level 10 you make up here builds 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.539
 this or heal and after that you can 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.950
 I should be able to ventilate a group 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.299
 unfortunately I did not judge 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.819
 nobody with whom I play now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.259
 could and therefore i could 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.700
 Now do not really say if that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 are only group behaves differently 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.079
 because you have the joke in the beginning 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.389
 Little skills and therefore difficult 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.310
 bypass these tough opponents 

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:01.229
 later you have long teeth 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.520
 already enough skills unlocked around that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.039
 to simplify the whole 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 By the way, airing is also worthwhile 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.479
 even though there may be less than 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.069
 the halls and that only at times 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.810
 gets a lot more items 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.909
 this alone increases the kills 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.379
 Last but not least, feed here now 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.430
 you can now have six 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.139
 buy rings 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.639
 you should really do that to her 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.569
 you will soon see how big 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.129
 difference is 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.840
 You should not forget that 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.090
 her with a straight so noon 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.139
 Eighth could always be direct and here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.909
 Do you see the ring now? 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.260
 because in every act there is basically so 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.680
 a ring dealer and necklaces 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.269
 dealer 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.340
 and here you see as a ring we 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.709
 want two to four hurt and two 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.719
 decks should basically only on the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.480
 ps pay attention at the beginning and there it is 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.099
 You can just double yourself with level 10 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.629
 always buy your neck too 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.299
 that's why I mean at 10 so far 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.859
 or compassionate level 9 and then air 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.069
 and if you are a group then you can 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.260
 you take turns coming, now 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.030
 the point that they but the whole 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.250
 should not take it so seriously, therefore, 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.199
 You should not lodge one now 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.310
 So far, such a ring is worth it 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.049
 then no more 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.389
 That's why you really have to pay attention 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.889
 check out briefly as I said in group 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.209
 is the thing anyway no problem but if 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.099
 you should not be alone 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.590
 waste a lot of time if not 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.870
 good neck there is just keep playing 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.639
 at a certain point the relative 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.280
 brisk you can the forge on 10 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.829
 upgrade as soon as you have that you can 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.900
 A 60 one hand was forging mine 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.239
 case I have as well as at 70 to come 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.280
 I may be equal to the level of up 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.949
 60 one-handed hammer because the two-handed 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.900
 was removed the dagan once went 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.030
 In the meantime , only the other hand is left 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.609
 and we really want one-handed 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.169
 only that he has two secondary am 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.030
 best of course would freeze or 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.470
 Something like that but not now either 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.509
 so wild especially if you are not so much 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.729
 coal which has called maz 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:51.280
 should you have more than enough and 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.989
 that's why you can build 23 as soon as possible 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.590
 we have one in one case that went 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.349
 very fast I have two seconds 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.299
 no matter if it's perfect 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.379
 I go to forge it immediately 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.659
 Of course, it always depends on how much gold 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.090
 I have and so on, but also continues 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.519
 then to forge and my goal is it 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 then to get the stages reduction 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.030
 Incidentally, you can do the same thing by now 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.310
 Make 61 then you can not go there 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.859
 namely to upgrade to maximum and could 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.449
 then a 70 was obstructed and at the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.029
 then in the end do exactly the same thing 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.820
 as now here meanwhile 60 means 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:27.310
 I can handle a 60 water already with level 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.110
 in the end 40 days with luck here 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.210
 meanwhile everyone thinks now already with 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.310
 the second sweden stage reduction 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.500
 that's pretty good 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.479
 I will continue and I have again 11 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.060
 You should not do that all too often 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.770
 look at your gold level reduction 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.229
 11 is really really good 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.690
 Although still makes enough coal have 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.729
 but it should really pay attention 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.680
 so it does not matter too much 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.539
 wasting time on it and medium 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.219
 I just sit the same and you can 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.159
 you with 49 and you know even that 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.659
 increase the difficulty of a riff 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.820
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:04.860
 we hope to see each other almost seasonally 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.860
 again and sat up soon
