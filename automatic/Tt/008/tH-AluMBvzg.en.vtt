00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
we were just looking at it's not

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.000 
we were just looking at it's not

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
have to download it and here it is so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.040 
have to download it and here it is so
it's<00:02:42.410> processed<00:02:42.860> my<00:02:43.070> sheet<00:02:43.340> layer<00:02:44.050> my

sections and my rendered views you can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.460 
sections and my rendered views you can
pinch<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.050> zone

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.310 

this<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.250> our<00:02:58.400> selection<00:02:58.700> tool<00:02:59.150> this<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.170> our

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
this is our selection tool this is our

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.390 
this is our selection tool this is our
annotation<00:03:00.980> tool

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:18.059 

we<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.360> put<00:03:07.599> a<00:03:07.840> call<00:03:08.349> out<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.209> tap<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.599> there<00:03:17.069> if

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
we can put a call out so tap in there if

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.410 
we can put a call out so tap in there if
you<00:03:18.220> don't<00:03:18.340> want<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.580> time<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.150> delete

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you don't want the time you can delete

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.059 
you don't want the time you can delete
it<00:03:19.450> otherwise<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.349> leave<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.650> time<00:03:20.890> on

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it otherwise you can leave the time on

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:30.180 
it otherwise you can leave the time on
there

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.820 

so<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.340> leave<00:03:31.490> text<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:31.970> it<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.680> go

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
so you can leave text on it if we go

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:42.960 
so you can leave text on it if we go
back<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.250> selection

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.290 

so<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.630> can<00:03:43.870> make<00:03:44.050> squiggly<00:03:44.560> lines<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:46.120> can

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
so you can make squiggly lines you can

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.730 
so you can make squiggly lines you can
put<00:03:46.480> text<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:48.250> can<00:03:48.430> put<00:03:49.620> rectangles<00:03:50.620> on

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
put text you can put rectangles on

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.370 
put text you can put rectangles on
things<00:03:51.040> circles<00:03:51.880> lines<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.990> can<00:03:53.140> also

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
things circles lines you can also

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.770 
things circles lines you can also
measure<00:03:53.830> things

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
measure things

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.600 
measure things
so<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.900> first<00:03:56.140> tap<00:03:56.440> is<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:57.190> start<00:03:57.460> of<00:03:57.550> the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
so the first tap is the start of the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.420 
so the first tap is the start of the
measurement<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.510> second<00:03:58.900> tap<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.680> end<00:04:00.220> of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
measurement the second tap is the end of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.060 
measurement the second tap is the end of
the<00:04:00.520> measurement<00:04:00.990> so<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.050> can<00:04:02.290> use<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.740> move

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
the measurement so you can use that move

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.460 
the measurement so you can use that move
it<00:04:03.190> along<00:04:03.280> get<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.000> as<00:04:04.120> close<00:04:04.390> as<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.570> can<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
it along get it as close as you can and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.920 
it along get it as close as you can and
it'll<00:04:05.920> give<00:04:06.070> you<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.220> distance<00:04:06.670> if<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.720> move

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
it'll give you the distance if I move

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.890 
it'll give you the distance if I move
that<00:04:08.080> down<00:04:08.260> there<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.460> I<00:04:10.180> move<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.720> the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
that down there and I move that to the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.580 
that down there and I move that to the
beam<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:12.070> can<00:04:12.220> see<00:04:12.430> how<00:04:12.610> high<00:04:12.820> my<00:04:13.120> beamers<00:04:13.630> you

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
beam you can see how high my beamers you

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.110 
beam you can see how high my beamers you
get<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.740> pretty<00:04:14.950> good<00:04:15.100> idea<00:04:15.160> how<00:04:15.670> high<00:04:15.820> my

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
get a pretty good idea how high my

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.560 
get a pretty good idea how high my
building<00:04:16.630> us<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:18.609> got<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.850> be<00:04:18.910> very<00:04:19.090> careful

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
building us it's got to be very careful

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.910 
building us it's got to be very careful
when<00:04:19.660> you're<00:04:19.750> moving<00:04:20.019> around<00:04:20.109> make<00:04:20.680> sure<00:04:20.709> you

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
when you're moving around make sure you

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.300 
when you're moving around make sure you
get<00:04:21.070> as<00:04:21.220> accurate<00:04:21.609> as<00:04:21.700> possible<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:24.160> can

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
get as accurate as possible you can

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.810 
get as accurate as possible you can
measure<00:04:24.430> angles<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.690> can<00:04:25.810> mesh<00:04:25.990> areas<00:04:29.820> this
