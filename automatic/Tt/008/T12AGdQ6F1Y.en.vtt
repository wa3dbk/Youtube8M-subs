the kickstand where the speaker is it is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.430 
the kickstand where the speaker is it is
and<00:01:43.959> this<00:01:44.959> is<00:01:45.020> also<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.740> DLNA<00:01:46.340> device<00:01:46.819> so<00:01:47.630> that's

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
and this is also a DLNA device so that's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.730 
and this is also a DLNA device so that's
the<00:01:48.619> way<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:49.009> share<00:01:49.220> your<00:01:49.490> HD<00:01:50.060> content

from the device with another DLNA device

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.680 
from the device with another DLNA device
understand<00:01:54.679> HTC<00:01:55.369> will<00:01:55.549> also<00:01:55.940> have<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.149> small

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
understand HTC will also have a small

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.770 
understand HTC will also have a small
DLNA<00:01:57.350> peripheral<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:58.340> if<00:01:58.429> your<00:01:58.580> TV<00:01:58.939> does<00:01:59.479> not

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
DLNA peripheral so if your TV does not

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.779 
DLNA peripheral so if your TV does not
have<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.110> feature<00:02:00.590> you'll<00:02:01.189> be<00:02:01.310> able<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.580> plug

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
have that feature you'll be able to plug

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.149 
have that feature you'll be able to plug
in<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:02.539> transfer<00:02:03.110> content<00:02:03.560> wirelessly

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:06.379 
is there an hdmi output port as well

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:09.790 
is there an hdmi output port as well
there's<00:02:06.830> not<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.149> hdmi<00:02:08.149> hardware<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:08.869> okay<00:02:09.590> and
