00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.840
 The Netherlands is getting bigger who simply hits or kicks this 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.729
 to hang something up 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.519
 give them so porous that there is no grip in it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.699
 and before you know it lie down to a photo frame with the wedding photo broken on the floor 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.640
 but that does not make mother the wife happy 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820
 nevertheless we can take care of our best 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 Holland used back in various weight classes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.369
 gippsland sky and the eights holland 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.060
 and all those used for other applications 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.250
 and I have such a suspicion that you will tell if you can do what you can do 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.480
 use 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 6 can do that 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.829
 holman plugs the materials used to a thickness of 26 millimeters 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 the plow continues to use but is suitable on materials of 13 millimeters 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 carry some targeted of 70 pounds 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.990
 Like a hole drilled hip fractures plug together 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 in the going 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.090
 The other option this guide to Apple is to take advantage of this 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.060
 that you don't complete the room has become better and he can still do something like that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 carry weight 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.910
 if the plow is used properly there it can weigh around 100 kilos 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.909
 wear well that prevents making mistakes 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.480
 next option that is parking too long 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.660
 this time use just from 10 millimeters thick is not meant to 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 screws for butter and data news 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.880
 to attract the link 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 working with the pronunciation 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 and gets up immediately 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.890
 and she sees I also have a barbecue
