00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.779 
there as well we have 150 and 25 but I
would<00:02:09.649> imagine<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.190> would<00:02:10.399> be<00:02:10.610> quite

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
would imagine that that would be quite

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.600 
would imagine that that would be quite
difficult<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:12.110> figure<00:02:12.380> out<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.220> only<00:02:13.370> way<00:02:13.550> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
difficult to figure out the only way you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.610 
difficult to figure out the only way you
could<00:02:13.790> do<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.810> cash<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.230> at<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.440> log

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
could do that if you cash it at the log

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.040 
could do that if you cash it at the log
of<00:02:15.800> us<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> ball<00:02:16.520> does<00:02:16.790> stop<00:02:17.120> exactly

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
of us and the ball does stop exactly

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.220 
of us and the ball does stop exactly
where<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.740> lands<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.580> that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
where it lands so that

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.199 
where it lands so that
isn't<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.799> best<00:02:22.099> time<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.640> game<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.000> aim

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
isn't the best time of the game the aim

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.630 
isn't the best time of the game the aim
of<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.510> game<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.379> just<00:02:24.409> catch<00:02:24.829> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
of the game really is to just catch the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.660 
of the game really is to just catch the
large<00:02:26.209> mushrooms<00:02:26.959> shredder<00:02:27.650> ball<00:02:27.950> now<00:02:28.489> this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
large mushrooms shredder ball now this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.300 
large mushrooms shredder ball now this
would<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:29.030> great<00:02:29.659> toy<00:02:30.200> for<00:02:30.230> taking<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.159> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310

beach maybe for a day out this would be
