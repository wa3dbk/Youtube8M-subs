one of the coolest ones I've been able
to<00:00:05.879> do<00:00:06.089> unfortunately<00:00:06.779> it<00:00:07.410> was<00:00:07.500> also<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:08.010> of

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
to do unfortunately it was also one of

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.290 
to do unfortunately it was also one of
the<00:00:08.160> most<00:00:08.250> frustrating<00:00:08.519> because<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.269> was

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
the most frustrating because I was

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.839 
the most frustrating because I was
unable<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.840> capture<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.740> effect<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.309> video

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
unable to capture the effect on video

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.360

see and I wanted a piece of that in my
home<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.090> idea<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.219> lamp

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
home this was my idea for how the lamp

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
home this was my idea for how the lamp
would<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.629> Klein<00:00:39.960> bottle<00:00:40.200> it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
would look I got this Klein bottle it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
would look I got this Klein bottle it's
really<00:00:40.950> cool<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> check<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
really cool you have to check out the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
really cool you have to check out the
link<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> continuous<00:00:44.129> surface

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
link for these it's a continuous surface

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
link for these it's a continuous surface
that<00:00:44.910> theoretically<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:46.070> no<00:00:47.070> volume<00:00:47.510> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that theoretically has no volume of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.560 
that theoretically has no volume of
course<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> fill<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> stuff<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
course you can fill it up with stuff and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260 
course you can fill it up with stuff and
I<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.750> 3d<00:00:52.140> printed<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> custom<00:00:53.520> stand<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I have 3d printed a custom stand for it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
I have 3d printed a custom stand for it
let's<00:00:54.750> hold<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.430> make<00:00:56.430> sure<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> doesn't

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
let's hold it up make sure it doesn't

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.610 
let's hold it up make sure it doesn't
get<00:00:56.940> knocked<00:00:57.090> over

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
get knocked over

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.090 
get knocked over
now<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.100> algae<00:00:59.699> only<00:01:00.440> illuminates<00:01:01.440> whenever

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now the algae only illuminates whenever

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
now the algae only illuminates whenever
it's<00:01:02.280> agitated<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> figured<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:03.989> take

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's agitated so I figured I would take

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.640 
it's agitated so I figured I would take
the<00:01:05.220> idea<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.880> stirrer<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.530> use

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the idea of a stirrer that you would use

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
the idea of a stirrer that you would use
in<00:01:07.770> chemistry<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.430> apply<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> Klein

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
in chemistry and apply this to the Klein

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.399 
in chemistry and apply this to the Klein
bottle<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> I've<00:01:12.990> made<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.260> lower

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
bottle to do this I've made the lower

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.600 
bottle to do this I've made the lower
part<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> base<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
part of the base here

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.109 
part of the base here
I<00:01:14.689> threw<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> tiny<00:01:16.200> servo<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.490> not

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
I threw a tiny servo in there which not

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.350 
I threw a tiny servo in there which not
sure<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> printed

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sure if you can see that and I printed

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.749 
sure if you can see that and I printed
out<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.979> wheel<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.900> two<00:01:24.900> magnets<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
out this wheel with two magnets on it

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.890 
out this wheel with two magnets on it
I'm<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> drop<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.570> BB<00:01:29.150> into<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.630> Klein

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
I'm going to drop a BB into the Klein

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.950 
I'm going to drop a BB into the Klein
bottle<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:32.280> will<00:01:32.490> move<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.970> BB<00:01:33.420> around

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bottle and we will move that BB around

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:44.060 
bottle and we will move that BB around
with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> servo<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.670> agitate<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:38.299> algae

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.220 

now<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.120> suspicion<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
now I have a suspicion that this and the

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.920 
now I have a suspicion that this and the
BB<00:01:49.650> as<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.460> saw<00:01:50.670> aren't<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.540> strong

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
BB as you saw aren't going to be strong

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.090 
BB as you saw aren't going to be strong
enough<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.230> really<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> good<00:01:54.000> light<00:01:54.390> going

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
enough to really get a good light going

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240 
enough to really get a good light going
so<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> backup<00:01:56.960> I've<00:01:57.960> taken<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.620> stolen

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so as a backup I've taken this stolen

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
so as a backup I've taken this stolen
this<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.820> children<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.810> creates<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this from my children it creates a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
this from my children it creates a
tornado<00:02:01.440> in<00:02:01.800> here<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:03.450> know

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
tornado in here with a little you know

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
tornado in here with a little you know
like<00:02:03.660> a<00:02:03.720> DC<00:02:04.140> motor<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:04.650> paddle<00:02:05.160> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.310> end

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
like a DC motor with a paddle on the end

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.850 
like a DC motor with a paddle on the end
of<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.760> extremely<00:02:06.750> simple<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> actually

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
of it extremely simple but I actually

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
of it extremely simple but I actually
think<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.460> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> end<00:02:08.820> up<00:02:08.940> being<00:02:09.149> more

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
think this is going to end up being more

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
think this is going to end up being more
effective<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.670> much<00:02:11.820> prettier

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
effective this which is so much prettier

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.340 
effective this which is so much prettier
though<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.020> we'll<00:02:13.410> give<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> try<00:02:13.830> okay<00:02:15.350> I've

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
though so we'll give it a try okay I've

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.690 
though so we'll give it a try okay I've
been<00:02:16.410> playing<00:02:16.800> with<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> couple<00:02:17.610> days

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
been playing with this for a couple days

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.240 
been playing with this for a couple days
now<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.660> stuff<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.500> really<00:02:19.920> cool

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
now and this stuff is really really cool

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.810 
now and this stuff is really really cool
it<00:02:20.850> looks<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.990> glow<00:02:22.440> stick<00:02:22.820> blue

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
it looks just like a glow stick blue

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.240 
it looks just like a glow stick blue
glow<00:02:24.360> stick<00:02:24.690> whenever<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.170> shake<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.620> it's

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
glow stick whenever you shake it up it's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.040 
glow stick whenever you shake it up it's
truly<00:02:26.850> beautiful<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.860> container<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.020> BB<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
truly beautiful this container the BB I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.650 
truly beautiful this container the BB I
was<00:02:31.320> using<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:32.100> swirl<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> around<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:33.330> didn't

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
was using to swirl it around just didn't

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.140 
was using to swirl it around just didn't
agitate<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> enough<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.100> get<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
agitate it enough to really get it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
agitate it enough to really get it
glowing<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.900> kind<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.380> see<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> swirl<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
glowing you kind of see a swirl on the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.340 
glowing you kind of see a swirl on the
bottom<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.090> wasn't<00:02:39.300> enough<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
bottom but it just wasn't enough to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
bottom but it just wasn't enough to
really<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:42.330> one<00:02:43.790> worked

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790

really get it go this one worked
fantastic<00:02:45.630> except<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.290> has<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> leak<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.580> in

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
fantastic except it has a leak so in

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
fantastic except it has a leak so in
between<00:02:48.510> each<00:02:48.780> time<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.080> wanted<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.590> try<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
between each time I wanted to try to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.740 
between each time I wanted to try to
film<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.489> had<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> put<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.239> back<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.600> these

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
film I had to put it back in these

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.030 
film I had to put it back in these
containers<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> came<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:53.330> which<00:02:55.040> aren't

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
containers that it came in which aren't

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
containers that it came in which aren't
as<00:02:56.160> pretty<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:57.209> do<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.480> job<00:02:57.620> that

as pretty but they do the job that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.320 
as pretty but they do the job that

brings me to the next problem I had I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.420 
brings me to the next problem I had I
couldn't<00:03:00.930> film<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.860> camera<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.310> I'm

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
couldn't film it the camera that I'm

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.880 
couldn't film it the camera that I'm
using<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.570> talk<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:04.230> just

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
using right now to talk into just

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.410 
using right now to talk into just
wouldn't<00:03:05.160> pick<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.670> was<00:03:05.790> too<00:03:05.940> dark<00:03:06.239> in

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
wouldn't pick it up it was too dark in

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
wouldn't pick it up it was too dark in
the<00:03:06.540> room<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.620> algae<00:03:07.769> doesn't<00:03:08.519> glow

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
the room and the algae doesn't glow

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.300 
the room and the algae doesn't glow
quite<00:03:09.540> bright<00:03:09.900> enough<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.470> pick<00:03:10.980> up<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
quite bright enough to pick up on the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.449 
quite bright enough to pick up on the
camera<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:13.500> camera<00:03:13.560> wouldn't<00:03:14.130> pick<00:03:14.340> it

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
camera and this camera wouldn't pick it

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.560 
camera and this camera wouldn't pick it
up<00:03:14.549> either<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:16.340> neither<00:03:17.340> would<00:03:17.610> my

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.380 

point-and-shoot<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> borrowed<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:23.970> guy

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
point-and-shoot so I borrowed this guy

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.720 
point-and-shoot so I borrowed this guy
and<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.780> picked<00:03:24.989> up<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.320> little<00:03:25.380> bit<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.700> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
and it picked up it a little bit but I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.449 
and it picked up it a little bit but I
couldn't<00:03:27.150> quite<00:03:27.330> get<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.799> exposure<00:03:28.799> how<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
couldn't quite get the exposure how I

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.430 
couldn't quite get the exposure how I
needed<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.180> show<00:03:30.360> off<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:31.080> was<00:03:31.230> still

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
needed it to show off it was still

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.060 
needed it to show off it was still
pretty<00:03:31.530> blurry

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
pretty blurry

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.930 
pretty blurry
until<00:03:33.000> finally<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.420> borrowed<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:35.070> one<00:03:35.130> which

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
until finally I borrowed this one which

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.940 
until finally I borrowed this one which
seems<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.330> work<00:03:36.420> okay

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.370 

I've<00:03:45.910> had<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.270> in<00:03:46.420> place<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.660> few<00:03:46.960> weeks<00:03:47.020> now

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
I've had this in place a few weeks now

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.140 
I've had this in place a few weeks now
and<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.680> can<00:03:47.860> easily<00:03:48.100> say<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.850> one<00:03:48.970> of<00:03:49.060> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
and I can easily say this is one of the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.800 
and I can easily say this is one of the
coolest<00:03:49.600> things<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.650> ever<00:03:50.850> seen<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
coolest things I have ever seen the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.650 
coolest things I have ever seen the
algae<00:03:53.400> pulses<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.610> lights<00:03:54.880> up<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:55.330> every

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
algae pulses and lights up with every

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.660 
algae pulses and lights up with every
step<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.110> take<00:03:56.319> across<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.740> room<00:03:57.040> coming<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.550> my

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
step I take across the room coming to my

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.430 
step I take across the room coming to my
side<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.150> bed<00:03:58.270> just<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.720> vibrations<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
side of the bed just the vibrations of

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.290 
side of the bed just the vibrations of
my<00:03:59.950> feet<00:04:00.190> hitting<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.550> floor<00:04:00.700> enough<00:04:01.180> to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
my feet hitting the floor enough to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320 
my feet hitting the floor enough to
agitate<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.990> I<00:04:02.860> can<00:04:03.430> lay<00:04:03.610> here<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.940> reach<00:04:04.120> up

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
agitate it I can lay here and reach up

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.990 
agitate it I can lay here and reach up
and<00:04:04.480> give<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.350> few<00:04:05.560> taps<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.580> lights<00:04:06.760> up

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
and give it a few taps and it lights up

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.750 
and give it a few taps and it lights up
for<00:04:07.240> 30<00:04:08.230> seconds<00:04:08.830> pretty<00:04:09.070> bright<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.670> then

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
for 30 seconds pretty bright and then

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.570 
for 30 seconds pretty bright and then
after<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.180> individual<00:04:11.080> algae<00:04:11.620> particles
