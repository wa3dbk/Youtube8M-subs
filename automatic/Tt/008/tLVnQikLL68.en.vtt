of making the last film because you knew

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.260 
of making the last film because you knew

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
that something is going to be the last

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.059 
that something is going to be the last
time<00:00:06.569> for<00:00:06.750> some<00:00:06.870> anything<00:00:07.140> right<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.680> mean<00:00:07.890> it

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069

in<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.940> don't<00:00:09.360> think<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.750> let<00:00:09.929> that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
in a way I don't think we let that

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.049 
in a way I don't think we let that
factor<00:00:10.620> into<00:00:10.650> our<00:00:11.010> everyday<00:00:11.370> thinking<00:00:11.790> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
factor into our everyday thinking that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.730 
factor into our everyday thinking that
was<00:00:12.210> only<00:00:12.360> because<00:00:12.480> also<00:00:13.019> when<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.259> start<00:00:13.590> on

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.160 
was only because also when you start on
a<00:00:13.769> film<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:15.389> can't<00:00:15.599> afford<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> be

you're doing the next day and it kind of

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.219 
you're doing the next day and it kind of
just<00:05:43.639> slots<00:05:44.300> into<00:05:44.510> place<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.900> know<00:05:45.020> what's

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
just slots into place you know what's

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.390 
just slots into place you know what's
happening<00:05:45.500> with<00:05:45.590> your<00:05:45.710> character<00:05:46.160> at<00:05:46.250> that

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
happening with your character at that

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.860 
happening with your character at that
point<00:05:46.639> you<00:05:47.510> know<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:50.270> interesting<00:05:50.539> things

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
point you know the interesting things

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.020 
point you know the interesting things
that<00:05:50.930> people<00:05:51.169> like<00:05:51.260> Alan<00:05:51.530> Rickman<00:05:51.889> who<00:05:52.100> knew

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
that people like Alan Rickman who knew

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.740 
that people like Alan Rickman who knew
his<00:05:53.330> character<00:05:53.810> arc<00:05:54.020> from<00:05:54.950> you<00:05:55.700> know<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:56.270> little

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
his character arc from you know a little

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.390 
his character arc from you know a little
while<00:05:56.900> back<00:05:57.169> he<00:05:57.440> knew<00:05:57.650> snakes<00:05:58.220> eventual<00:05:59.080> story

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
while back he knew snakes eventual story

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.460 
while back he knew snakes eventual story
so<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.669> think<00:06:02.030> for<00:06:02.210> him<00:06:02.510> it's<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:02.870> much<00:06:03.020> more<00:06:03.229> it

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
so I think for him it's and much more it

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.290 
so I think for him it's and much more it
was<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:03.800> much<00:06:03.979> more<00:06:04.130> delicate<00:06:04.550> balancing<00:06:05.270> act

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
was a much more delicate balancing act

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.289 
was a much more delicate balancing act
of<00:06:05.690> trying<00:06:05.960> to
