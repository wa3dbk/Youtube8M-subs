know a proper fitting rope halter

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.160 
know a proper fitting rope halter
wouldn't<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.930> one

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
wouldn't look like that and this one

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.479 
wouldn't look like that and this one
this<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.649> proportions<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.129> so

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this one the proportions are all good so

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
this one the proportions are all good so
you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.690> nose<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> right

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you know the nose in about the right

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.990 
you know the nose in about the right
spot<00:00:40.829> when<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.670> you've<00:00:41.790> got

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
spot when that's up there if you've got

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.150 
spot when that's up there if you've got
one<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.510> bit<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.930> hangs<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.950> down

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
one with this bit here hangs way down

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.119 
one with this bit here hangs way down
there<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> nose<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:46.129> they're

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
there when the nose is up here they're

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.700 
there when the nose is up here they're
not<00:00:47.250> they're<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> be

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
not they're not so good they need to be

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
not they're not so good they need to be
they<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.420> have<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.629> proportions<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
they need to have good proportions to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
they need to have good proportions to
them<00:00:54.800> anyway<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.460> should

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
them anyway so that's where they should

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.849 
them anyway so that's where they should
sit<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.660> start<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> get

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
sit to start with when you when you get

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
sit to start with when you when you get
them<00:00:58.980> tied<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.300> I'll<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.510> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
them tied up and now what I'll do is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
them tied up and now what I'll do is
I'll<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.960> ahead<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> I'll<00:01:01.410> show<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> exactly

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
I'll go ahead and I'll show you exactly

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060 
I'll go ahead and I'll show you exactly
how<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.750> tie<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.170> there's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> tie

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
how to tie it there's a right way to tie

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.780 
how to tie it there's a right way to tie
it<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> wrong<00:01:05.369> way<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> tie<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it in a wrong way to tie it so this is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.340 
it in a wrong way to tie it so this is
what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.030> start<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.720> tied<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:09.960> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
what we start with when it's tied up you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.130 
what we start with when it's tied up you
know<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.770> tails<00:01:11.010> tucked<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> I'm

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
know that tails tucked in there so I'm

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.920 
know that tails tucked in there so I'm
just<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> go<00:01:13.710> ahead<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.010> undo<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.930> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just going to go ahead and undo it so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
just going to go ahead and undo it so
when<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
when you when you do this thing up you

when you when you do this thing up you
want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.900> end<00:01:19.140> here

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
poke it down through that loop and then

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
poke it down through that loop and then
pull<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:22.770> whole<00:01:22.950> tribe<00:01:23.189> under<00:01:23.369> their<00:01:23.610> chin

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
there now you want to take this and put

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
there now you want to take this and put
it<00:01:28.740> through<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:30.090> towards<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it through from the back towards the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
front and then pull it back through

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.789 
front and then pull it back through
itself<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> okay

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
okay that's how your loosen it the wrong
way<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> tie<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.619> tying<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.280> back

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
way to tie these is tying them back

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.260 
way to tie these is tying them back
through<00:01:50.759> themselves<00:01:51.680> like<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.000> two<00:01:54.000> things

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
through themselves like that two things

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.460 
through themselves like that two things
will<00:01:54.420> happen<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.869> pull<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:55.259> they'll

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
will happen if they pull back they'll

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
will happen if they pull back they'll
slip<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.060> you'll<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> loose

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
slip like that and you'll have a loose

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
slip like that and you'll have a loose
horse<00:01:57.719> running<00:01:58.020> around<00:01:58.200> somewhere<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.250> other

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
horse running around somewhere the other

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.499 
horse running around somewhere the other
thing<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.729> pull<00:01:59.939> back<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.329> got

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
thing if they pull back and they got

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
thing if they pull back and they got
really<00:02:00.719> tight<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.350> probably<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> cut<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
really tight you probably have to cut it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.069 
really tight you probably have to cut it
off<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.030> throw<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> halter<00:02:03.930> away

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
off and and throw the halter away

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.749 
off and and throw the halter away
because<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.380> would<00:02:04.469> never<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.829> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
because you would never get it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.570 
because you would never get it
you'd<00:02:06.090> never<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> undone<00:02:06.780> again

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you'd never get it undone again

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.640 
you'd never get it undone again
so<00:02:09.580> once<00:02:09.759> again<00:02:09.910> when<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.780> put<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.050> take

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
so once again when you put it on take

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.309 
so once again when you put it on take
this<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.040> push<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.020> make<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.050> loop

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
this in push that up and make a loop

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.559 
this in push that up and make a loop
right<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:14.620> hold<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.069> with<00:02:15.250> your<00:02:15.400> hand<00:02:15.610> pass

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
right here hold that with your hand pass

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.330 
right here hold that with your hand pass
this<00:02:16.810> one<00:02:16.990> underneath<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.680> pull<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
this one underneath and just pull it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.580 
this one underneath and just pull it
back<00:02:18.430> through<00:02:18.850> there<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:22.290> there<00:02:23.290> go

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
back through there like that there go

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.940 
back through there like that there go
and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:24.310> then<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:26.380> know<00:02:26.410> now<00:02:26.680> it's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
and then then just you know now it's

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.590 
and then then just you know now it's
tired<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.490> probably<00:02:27.670> should<00:02:27.910> show<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
tired I probably should show you the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.990 
tired I probably should show you the
best<00:02:28.870> way<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.080> put<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.530> -<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.880> you
