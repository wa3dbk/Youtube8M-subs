00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.930
 a quarter of an hour later another 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.150
 stone that to our surprise was put 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.150
 to eat quietly next to the dejected 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.690
 We remembered what Javier Lopez said 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.350
 of ceballos in his book memories 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.450
 living from hunting over the waiters 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 it is normal to hear theories and more theories 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.220
 about the waiters that if the herds 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.010
 enter first and the big males more 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.440
 late that the nights of a lot of moon 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.989
 They are good because old pigs do not 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.400
 come out that first comes the squire and 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.470
 then the macareno like this until infinity 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.680
 many times the less they have hunted 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.870
 night more theories have to me have I 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.960
 entered machazo is very early and very 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.350
 late before after and while a piara 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.120
 he ate when a big male came in 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.950
 they make room for good or for 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260
 bad 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 if on moonlit nights the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.880
 I would have killed a few good ones 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.549
 bugs 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.060
 I have a habit when I throw no 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.909
 move from the site and keep waiting is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.280
 normal to kill one and the time that enters 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.409
 another that has not heard the shot or has not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.049
 located by coming from afar 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.149
 I have come to charge 6 pigs in open 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.909
 from a turret that dominated the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.720
 feeder a pond and next had a 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.120
 stubble of freshly mown wheat 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.450
 the first one a good macho I threw 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.870
 drinking it fell into the water and sank so not 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.570
 annoyed after a while I killed another drinking in 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.930
 the same place was dead at two meters 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.710
 from the shore the sixth and last I saw it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.660
 out of shot eating in the stubble not 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.110
 could wait to see if it came to the water 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.950
 because the moon was going down and losing strength like that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.730
 is that I descended from the turret and entered 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.730
 getting to shoot
