00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.750
 opportunity to go on tour toured 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.480
 almost everyone was everywhere 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.180
 Latin America and Europe 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.490
 the truth that there was a very 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.150
 great of what was the life of violet 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.430

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.830

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.420
 the mylar is also not growing 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.910
 the relationship and he is aware that something 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.440
 inside it can become good 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 and can show the good person that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 can really get to do the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.260
 look from the first season if you had 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 a big change at the beginning started from 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.360
 girlfriend with lion and we go home 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.880
 later he realized that love gave me 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.490
 what's yours, your time of solitude until 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.050
 he discovered that yes he could fall in love and 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.000
 by federico and federico drama by 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.010
 federico evolved quite a change 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.060
 with all a super cute growth 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.100

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.230
 I love that also falls in love and that 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.610
 he also has his human side 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.830
 and good nothing and with violet also the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.680
 Success has not been experienced at the beginning 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.880
 hated and then how was it was 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.380
 wanting it a little bit more because 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.720
 violent taught a lot of things 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.790
 also in the first second and this 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.180
 third like all these little things that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.380
 let's see they are made as bigger 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.380
 most notorious 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.880
 At the beginning, let's come to Latin America 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.970
 and it was very nice all the public 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.010
 all the Latin audience and beautiful the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.720
 people we had the chance to meet 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.510
 to the public of different countries each 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.800
 one has its different ways of 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.470
 express your love with your fanaticism 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.050
 and it was very beautiful and then we put on 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.090
 for europe we also had a very 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.370
 very good but very fun because 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.500
 we came to each country and we had 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.210
 have to learn the language of each country to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.490
 we are in france and we have to talk 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.860
 in French and it look super 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.180
 fun because the audience itself 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.760
 I was very happy that we 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.710
 let's make the effort to speak in their 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.210
 let's say e Italy and also what 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.180
 same and the fact of having had so many 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.260
 shows made us grow a lot 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.570
 professionally not having been up 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.760
 of a scenario how to manage how 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.470
 interact with the public I think that 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.060
 it served us a lot for this third 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.530
 season also nothing because to go 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.020
 the musical moments we also have 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.400
 more resources and more things to do 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.280
 after having come to such a tour 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.200
 long 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.330
 the truth that the tour taught us a 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.370
 lots of things we live with 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.870
 guys and we were every day for 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.940
 go we had to return our 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.880
 values ​​and our good moods and 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.250
 keep going despite the fatigue and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.010
 despite a lot of things all of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.470
 hand and together so we 're very 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.990
 happy the experience of the tour and 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.990
 hopefully good will come again 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.760
 I would like to thank 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.800
 first of all to all the fans that 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.840
 they have been supporting us since the first 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.390
 violet season and they were 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.970
 growing up with all of us start 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.310
 with 14 and to go also girls that 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.830
 they were 14 nowadays they have 17 and 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.830
 they were also growing up in friends and with 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.840
 all the girls in the cast and it's super 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.680
 exciting to see how they accompany us and 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.230
 all the love that and the time that is that 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.180
 is that you give yourselves to come to 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.640
 wait at the door to be hours 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.210
 to accompany us for shows to 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.720
 see us the truth that we thank you for 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.720
 all the love 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.909
 if it is I have to give a tip first 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.550
 that nothing is always being oneself 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.770
 has around or nobody changes them 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.389
 I think the most important thing of a 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.650
 Always maintain the essence 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.650
 one's 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.290
 and if they dream of something work and 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.670
 strive and I believe that if really 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.150
 they dream 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.790
 and if they have it, they will comply and if 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.530
 is going to get to them so now more than 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.639
 nothing that is I think the most important thing 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.240
 It is always to be one 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:16.099
 and good is the same, thank you and I want you 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.770
 know that thanks to you we 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.159
 we are here without your support this would not be 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.779
 nothing and nothing is very nice to have more 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.159
 always close because we when 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.900
 we are up a stage when we 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.249
 we find with you we 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.259
 they return everything that we 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:31.550
 we work and everything that we 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.560
 we strive we do it for and so that 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.349
 you stop so they feel good 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.240
 to have a moment of distraction 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.069
 that they forget their problems that 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.310
 dance that those people who liberate 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.520
 anarchy that are free and nothing fight 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.710
 for your dreams 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.449
 if they have something in their heads what 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.789
 they want to make you pressured with the 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.509
 art that I do not speak 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.110
 strive and always trust you and 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.110
 listen, I know
