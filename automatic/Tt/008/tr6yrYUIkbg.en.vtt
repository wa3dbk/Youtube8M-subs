take about ten percent skill I'd say to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.289

actually pull off the shot but to hit
the<00:01:27.479> shot<00:01:27.720> would<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:29.210> 90%<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.450> because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the shot would be about 90% look because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.270 
the shot would be about 90% look because
the<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.340> super<00:01:32.610> steady<00:01:32.939> aim<00:01:33.180> it's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
the this is not super steady aim it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
the this is not super steady aim it's
random<00:01:35.280> where<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> bullet<00:01:35.939> goes<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.689> no

random where the bullet goes when you no

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
random where the bullet goes when you no
scope<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.970> argument<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.659> take

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960

objective<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.320> end<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.800> losing<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
objective but I end up losing the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.190 
objective but I end up losing the
majority<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.210> my<00:02:21.420> ground<00:02:21.720> war<00:02:21.960> domination

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
majority of my ground war domination

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.620 
majority of my ground war domination
games<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:24.080> teammates<00:02:25.080> basically<00:02:25.710> and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
games because of teammates basically and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.670 
games because of teammates basically and
you'll<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:27.690> oh<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.230> because<00:02:28.440> they're<00:02:28.560> all

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you'll think oh it's because they're all

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.650 
you'll think oh it's because they're all
sniping<00:02:29.130> yourself<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.210> majority

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
sniping yourself now this the majority

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
sniping yourself now this the majority
of<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:30.870> teammates<00:02:31.260> are<00:02:31.500> using<00:02:31.770> assault<00:02:32.040> rifles

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
of my teammates are using assault rifles

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.810 
of my teammates are using assault rifles
or<00:02:32.790> SMGs<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> problem<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.560> people<00:02:35.340> seem

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
or SMGs and the problem is people seem

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.310 
or SMGs and the problem is people seem
to<00:02:36.110> assume<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:38.240> they<00:02:39.240> see<00:02:39.300> someone<00:02:40.050> getting

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
to assume that they see someone getting

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.960 
to assume that they see someone getting
a<00:02:40.410> Montague<00:02:40.830> clip<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.280> they're<00:02:41.400> also<00:02:41.520> losing

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
a Montague clip but they're also losing

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.750 
a Montague clip but they're also losing
the<00:02:42.060> objective<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.760> they

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the objective and they think that they

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.300 
the objective and they think that they
are<00:02:45.180> not<00:02:45.660> playing<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> objective<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.950> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
are not playing the objective and it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.770 
are not playing the objective and it's
their<00:02:47.580> fault<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.000> they're<00:02:48.209> losing<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.660> they

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
their fault that they're losing and they

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.960 
their fault that they're losing and they
should<00:02:49.110> just<00:02:49.380> like<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.550> showed<00:02:50.760> at<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
should just like I showed at the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.720 
should just like I showed at the
beginning<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.540> show<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.620> video<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:53.160> them<00:02:53.370> just

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
beginning just show a video of them just

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.910 
beginning just show a video of them just
capturing<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.480> flag<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.080> getting<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.770> touch

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
capturing a flag and getting one touch

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.140 
capturing a flag and getting one touch
up<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.160> clip<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.459> same<00:02:56.580> time<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.940> just

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
up to clip on the same time or just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.120 
up to clip on the same time or just
clattering<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.050> flag<00:02:58.260> good<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> most

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
clattering a flag good but the most

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.400 
clattering a flag good but the most
boring<00:02:59.550> thing<00:02:59.580> ever<00:02:59.850> would<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.410> watching

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
boring thing ever would be watching

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.980 
boring thing ever would be watching
someone<00:03:02.010> capturing<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> flag<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.660> free

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
someone capturing a flag for free

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.840 
someone capturing a flag for free
minutes<00:03:04.380> I'm<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.890> different<00:03:05.040> flag<00:03:05.430> captures

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
minutes I'm just different flag captures

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.670 
minutes I'm just different flag captures
I<00:03:05.940> couldn't<00:03:06.209> think<00:03:06.270> anything<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:07.470> boring

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
I couldn't think anything more boring

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
I couldn't think anything more boring
apart<00:03:08.280> from<00:03:08.400> watching<00:03:08.490> paint<00:03:08.910> dry<00:03:09.030> which

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
apart from watching paint dry which

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.210 
apart from watching paint dry which
probably<00:03:09.690> would<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.080> more<00:03:10.260> entertaining<00:03:10.560> than

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
probably would be more entertaining than

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.290 
probably would be more entertaining than
watching<00:03:11.340> people<00:03:12.000> capture<00:03:12.360> flag<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.100> but

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
watching people capture flag and but

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.520 
watching people capture flag and but
just<00:03:15.300> frustrates<00:03:15.720> me<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:15.959> people

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
just frustrates me that people

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.920 
just frustrates me that people
automatically<00:03:17.370> assume<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:18.030> they<00:03:18.600> don't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
automatically assume that they don't

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.229 
automatically assume that they don't
play<00:03:19.260> capture<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.860> objective<00:03:20.370> where<00:03:20.580> what<00:03:21.209> i

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
play capture the objective where what i

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.540 
play capture the objective where what i
find<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.840> majority<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.530> time<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.070> that

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
find the majority of the time is that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.150 
find the majority of the time is that
the<00:03:23.730> snipers<00:03:24.330> capture<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.350> objective<00:03:25.830> more

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
the snipers capture the objective more

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
the snipers capture the objective more
than<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.940> people<00:03:27.269> are<00:03:27.360> using<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.930> auto

than the people are using the auto
