00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:35.549
 it whole then I'll move up a 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:43.140
 a little more than with the heat and smoke 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:45.209
 up always cling more shade is 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 a little more brown shade or 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:54.480
 on the moving eyelid above the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.579
 that will raise eyebrow with 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.599
 tweezers with the black shadow you go 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:04.250
 deposit at the root of the lashes and will 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.250
 forming these waves only rising 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.769
 to deposit your smoking by going up 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.269
 with the same brush you passed 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.549
 brown without getting more shade just this 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.940
 more co2 or as much brown as the 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.940
 job 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.800

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.750
 side the eyes of the face illuminated 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.959
 the eyeliner and saying that I am 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:21.549
 using the apothecary eyeliner 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.540
 has been casting the eyebrow to vote 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.330
