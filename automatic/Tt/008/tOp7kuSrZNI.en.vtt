in this video I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.820 
in this video I'm gonna be showing you
how<00:00:14.260> to<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.880> basic<00:00:16.390> pinch<00:00:16.840> tie-in<00:00:17.230> it<00:00:17.680> is

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
how to do the basic pinch tie-in it is

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.780 
how to do the basic pinch tie-in it is
kind<00:00:18.700> of<00:00:18.790> a<00:00:19.050> basic<00:00:20.190> little<00:00:21.190> skill<00:00:21.550> that<00:00:21.700> you

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
kind of a basic little skill that you

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.310 
kind of a basic little skill that you
need<00:00:21.940> to<00:00:22.029> learn<00:00:22.180> when<00:00:22.420> you<00:00:22.480> tie<00:00:22.660> flies<00:00:22.869> and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
need to learn when you tie flies and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.070 
need to learn when you tie flies and
it's<00:00:24.130> how<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.250> apply<00:00:24.640> material<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.630> your<00:00:25.810> hook

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
it's how you apply material to your hook

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's how you apply material to your hook
with<00:00:27.070> precision<00:00:27.700> and<00:00:27.939> control<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.800> what<00:00:29.950> we're

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
with precision and control so what we're

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.050 
with precision and control so what we're
gonna<00:00:30.130> do<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.460> we're<00:00:30.580> gonna<00:00:30.669> take<00:00:30.880> our

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
gonna do is we're gonna take our

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.660 
gonna do is we're gonna take our
material<00:00:31.480> and<00:00:32.050> I'm<00:00:32.169> right-handed<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.860> my

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
material and I'm right-handed so my

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.000 
material and I'm right-handed so my
pinch<00:00:34.030> tie-in<00:00:34.329> technique<00:00:34.840> always<00:00:35.350> happens

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
pinch tie-in technique always happens

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.750 
pinch tie-in technique always happens
with<00:00:36.310> my<00:00:36.550> left<00:00:37.480> hand<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:39.340> reason<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.700> do

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
with my left hand and the reason I do

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.550 
with my left hand and the reason I do
that<00:00:39.880> is<00:00:40.060> because<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.570> can<00:00:40.750> control<00:00:41.170> on<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
that is because I can control on the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.230 
that is because I can control on the
back<00:00:41.739> of<00:00:41.950> the<00:00:42.010> shank<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.370> hook<00:00:42.520> where<00:00:43.210> I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
back of the shank of the hook where I

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.870 
back of the shank of the hook where I
want<00:00:43.720> this<00:00:43.900> material<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.590> go<00:00:44.740> in<00:00:44.890> now<00:00:45.580> you<00:00:45.640> can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
want this material to go in now you can

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.030 
want this material to go in now you can
see<00:00:46.090> I<00:00:46.390> am<00:00:46.510> pinching<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:47.170> material<00:00:47.590> with<00:00:47.800> my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
see I am pinching the material with my

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.580 
see I am pinching the material with my
fingertips<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.970> am<00:00:49.390> NOT<00:00:49.570> pinching<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.170> hook<00:00:50.380> at

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
fingertips I am NOT pinching the hook at

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.470 
fingertips I am NOT pinching the hook at
all<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:51.100> hook<00:00:51.310> I'll<00:00:51.820> actually<00:00:52.030> take<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
all the hook I'll actually take the

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.970 
all the hook I'll actually take the
material<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:52.900> I'll<00:00:53.170> just<00:00:53.320> take<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.560> and<00:00:53.800> rest

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
material and I'll just take it and rest

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.000 
material and I'll just take it and rest
it<00:00:54.220> on<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.400> hook<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.380> you'll<00:00:56.380> get<00:00:56.650> used<00:00:56.860> to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it on the hook and you'll get used to

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.070 
it on the hook and you'll get used to
how<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.490> want<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.880> pinch<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.450> material<00:00:58.900> and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
how you want to pinch the material and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.020 
how you want to pinch the material and
get<00:00:59.860> used<00:01:00.040> to<00:01:00.130> using<00:01:00.370> your<00:01:00.490> thumb<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:00.910> your

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
get used to using your thumb and your

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.640 
get used to using your thumb and your
index<00:01:01.060> finger<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:01.810> you<00:01:02.170> always<00:01:02.350> want<00:01:02.590> the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
index finger and you always want the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.670 
index finger and you always want the
material<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.310> be<00:01:03.430> parallel<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:05.049> shank<00:01:05.590> of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
material to be parallel to the shank of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.929 
material to be parallel to the shank of
hook<00:01:05.860> when<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.070> tie<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.640> don't<00:01:06.820> want

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
hook when you tie it in you don't want

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.630 
hook when you tie it in you don't want
to<00:01:07.000> be<00:01:07.060> tying<00:01:07.330> it<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:08.229> this<00:01:08.560> or<00:01:09.189> off<00:01:09.430> to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
to be tying it in like this or off to

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.190 
to be tying it in like this or off to
the<00:01:09.729> side<00:01:09.939> you<00:01:09.970> always<00:01:10.270> want<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.600> be<00:01:10.750> parallel

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the side you always want to be parallel

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.020 
the side you always want to be parallel
and<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.680> takes<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:12.009> little<00:01:12.220> bit<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.430> practice<00:01:12.850> to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
and it takes a little bit of practice to

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.239 
and it takes a little bit of practice to
kind<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.299> figure<00:01:13.509> out<00:01:13.720> how<00:01:14.439> to<00:01:14.499> pinch<00:01:14.829> it<00:01:15.039> and

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
kind of figure out how to pinch it and

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:18.179 
kind of figure out how to pinch it and
what<00:01:16.030> works<00:01:16.210> for<00:01:16.359> you<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:17.499> the<00:01:17.560> idea<00:01:18.009> behind

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
what works for you now the idea behind

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.370 
what works for you now the idea behind
the<00:01:18.429> pinch<00:01:18.640> tie-in<00:01:18.969> is<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.899> we<00:01:20.079> are<00:01:20.170> using

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
the pinch tie-in is that we are using

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.969 
the pinch tie-in is that we are using
pinch<00:01:20.799> tension<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.820> keep<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.270> base<00:01:22.990> kind<00:01:23.890> of

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
pinch tension to keep the base kind of

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.980 
pinch tension to keep the base kind of
the<00:01:24.070> base<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.490> these<00:01:24.609> fibers<00:01:24.880> here<00:01:25.270> nice<00:01:25.749> and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
the base of these fibers here nice and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.020 
the base of these fibers here nice and
stiff<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.439> add<00:01:26.530> control<00:01:27.009> that's<00:01:27.670> gonna<00:01:27.819> be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
stiff and add control that's gonna be

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.059 
stiff and add control that's gonna be
where<00:01:28.240> we<00:01:28.390> want<00:01:28.539> to<00:01:28.630> tie<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.890> biggest

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
where we want to tie it in the biggest

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.219 
where we want to tie it in the biggest
mistake<00:01:30.520> people<00:01:30.549> make<00:01:30.939> is<00:01:31.119> they<00:01:31.359> try<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.719> pinch

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
mistake people make is they try to pinch

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.929 
mistake people make is they try to pinch
the<00:01:32.409> material<00:01:32.829> and<00:01:33.039> they<00:01:33.670> do<00:01:33.789> everything

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
the material and they do everything

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.730 
the material and they do everything
right<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.539> they<00:01:34.869> lay<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.380> hook<00:01:35.530> shank

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
right and they lay it on the hook shank

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.559 
right and they lay it on the hook shank
but<00:01:36.009> what<00:01:36.130> they've<00:01:36.280> done<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.700> their<00:01:37.210> fingers

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
but what they've done is their fingers

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.209 
but what they've done is their fingers
are<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:37.929> far<00:01:38.229> away<00:01:38.350> from<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.710> material<00:01:38.829> when

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
are so far away from the material when

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.039 
are so far away from the material when
they<00:01:39.249> go<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.490> tie<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:39.819> in<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.600> can<00:01:40.719> see<00:01:40.929> our

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
they go to tie it in you can see our

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.099 
they go to tie it in you can see our
material<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:42.310> rolls<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.179> doesn't

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
material just rolls and doesn't

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.620 
material just rolls and doesn't
cooperate<00:01:44.639> so<00:01:45.639> the<00:01:45.789> idea<00:01:46.030> behind<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.420> pinch

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
cooperate so the idea behind the pinch

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.379 
cooperate so the idea behind the pinch
tie-in<00:01:47.049> is<00:01:47.619> you<00:01:47.770> use<00:01:47.979> your<00:01:48.189> index<00:01:48.490> finger<00:01:48.670> kind

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
tie-in is you use your index finger kind

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.599 
tie-in is you use your index finger kind
of<00:01:49.539> as<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> guide<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:50.859> what<00:01:51.009> we're<00:01:51.130> gonna<00:01:51.219> do<00:01:51.460> is

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
of as a guide and what we're gonna do is

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.039 
of as a guide and what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:51.729> going<00:01:51.819> to<00:01:51.880> take<00:01:52.060> our<00:01:52.270> thread<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.959> you

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
we're going to take our thread and you

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.289 
we're going to take our thread and you
can<00:01:53.200> see<00:01:53.409> how<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.619> just<00:01:53.770> kind<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.579> use<00:01:54.700> my<00:01:54.729> index

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
can see how I just kind of use my index

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.899 
can see how I just kind of use my index
finger<00:01:55.749> as<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.959> guide<00:01:56.319> to<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.920> place<00:01:57.459> it<00:01:57.490> right

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
finger as a guide to just place it right

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.940 
finger as a guide to just place it right
where<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> want<00:01:58.929> to<00:01:59.079> place<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.709> can<00:01:59.829> see

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
where I want to place it you can see

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.399 
where I want to place it you can see
these<00:02:00.100> materials<00:02:00.369> are<00:02:00.789> stiff<00:02:01.090> enough<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
these materials are stiff enough that

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.809 
these materials are stiff enough that
when<00:02:02.649> they're<00:02:02.799> close<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.189> my<00:02:03.280> index<00:02:03.520> finger

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
when they're close to my index finger

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.769 
when they're close to my index finger
they<00:02:03.969> don't<00:02:04.149> roll<00:02:04.479> from<00:02:05.350> side<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.649> side<00:02:05.799> and

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
they don't roll from side to side and

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.820 
they don't roll from side to side and
kind<00:02:07.779> of<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.929> cockeyed<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.500> me

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
kind of get cockeyed on me

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.180 
kind of get cockeyed on me
so<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.810> deer<00:02:11.050> hair<00:02:11.290> there's<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.800> little<00:02:12.069> bit

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
so with deer hair there's a little bit

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.590 
so with deer hair there's a little bit
of<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.459> trick<00:02:12.700> with<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.090> well<00:02:13.240> as<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.510> a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
of a trick with that as well as I do a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.590 
of a trick with that as well as I do a
loose<00:02:14.130> tie<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:15.970> see<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.330> have

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
loose tie in so you can see I don't have

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.770 
loose tie in so you can see I don't have
too<00:02:16.810> much<00:02:16.959> tension<00:02:17.319> on<00:02:17.650> my<00:02:18.269> thread<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:19.599> and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
too much tension on my thread here and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.100 
too much tension on my thread here and
that<00:02:19.900> way<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:21.129> envelop<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.360> entire<00:02:22.390> clump

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
that way I can envelop the entire clump

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.150 
that way I can envelop the entire clump
of<00:02:23.260> deer<00:02:23.439> hair

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
of deer hair

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.520 
of deer hair
from<00:02:24.580> side<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.850> side<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.840> other<00:02:26.020> materials

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
from side to side with other materials

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.440 
from side to side with other materials
you<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.830> necessarily<00:02:27.310> need<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.520> use<00:02:27.790> this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you don't necessarily need to use this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.230 
you don't necessarily need to use this
loose<00:02:28.720> tension<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:30.280> with<00:02:30.490> deer<00:02:30.730> hair<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> do

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
loose tension but with deer hair you do

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.720 
loose tension but with deer hair you do
and<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.380> pinch<00:02:32.770> tie-in<00:02:33.190> allows<00:02:33.460> me<00:02:33.640> to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and what that pinch tie-in allows me to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.910 
and what that pinch tie-in allows me to
do<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> can<00:02:34.150> put<00:02:34.450> thread<00:02:34.690> wraps<00:02:34.930> right<00:02:35.680> where

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
do is I can put thread wraps right where

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.490 
do is I can put thread wraps right where
I<00:02:35.950> want<00:02:36.250> them<00:02:36.340> then<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.630> keep<00:02:38.110> pinching

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
I want them then I can keep pinching

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860 
I want them then I can keep pinching
wrap<00:02:39.430> down<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> material<00:02:40.420> once<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
wrap down on the material once the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.980 
wrap down on the material once the
material<00:02:41.410> has<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:42.040> two<00:02:42.760> three<00:02:43.120> four<00:02:43.390> wraps<00:02:43.660> on

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
material has a two three four wraps on

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.750 
material has a two three four wraps on
it<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.350> then<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.740> it's<00:02:44.920> secure<00:02:45.280> then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
it and then you know it's secure then

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.410 
it and then you know it's secure then
you<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:46.060> let<00:02:46.210> go<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:47.350> your<00:02:47.620> pinch<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you can let go of your pinch and that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.200 
you can let go of your pinch and that
way<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> material<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:51.040> secured<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.790> right

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
way the material is secured and right

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.180 
way the material is secured and right
where<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.810> want<00:02:53.020> it<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
where you want it to be and that is the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.060 
where you want it to be and that is the
pinch<00:02:54.520> tie<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:55.390> pretty<00:02:55.840> easy<00:02:56.110> technique<00:02:56.680> to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
pinch tie in a pretty easy technique to

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.700 
pinch tie in a pretty easy technique to
learn<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.300> use<00:02:58.510> but<00:02:59.140> it's<00:02:59.260> absolutely

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
learn and to use but it's absolutely

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.520 
learn and to use but it's absolutely
essential<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.840> controlling<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.990> material

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
essential to controlling the material

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.150 
essential to controlling the material
and<00:03:02.740> tying<00:03:03.730> good<00:03:04.000> flies<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.830> pinch

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
and tying good flies that is the pinch

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.850 
and tying good flies that is the pinch
tie-in<00:03:06.520> technique
